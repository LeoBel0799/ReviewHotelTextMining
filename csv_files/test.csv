"When i visited they were having a great Managers Reception in the Lobby and they had great food, drinks and conversation. I was able to meet fellow guest at the hotel and Cassandra (Manager) who was absolutely awesome with alot of knowledge of the Atlanta Area. If your at the location on a Wednesday, Definitely do not miss out on this treat.Dear Vanessa,Thank you so much for taking the time to review our property, and leave us such great feedback. We strive to make each and every guest experience a superior one, and hope we were able to do that for you during your stay. I'm so glad you enjoyed our manager's reception, and I'll be sure to pass your kind words on to Cassandra!We look forward to having you stay with us again, the next time you're in the Atlanta area.Sincerely,Noelle TaylorFront Office ManagerQuality Suites-Buckhead Village",Good
"We stayed here three nights while visiting New Orleans. The hot breakfast, free drinks 'finger food', and free wifi were very good. The room was well appointed and well maintained. The thermostat was easy to operate and kept the room at the proper temperature. The bed was super comfortable.The hotel was in a walking distance to the French Quarter and the WWII museum.I would definitely stay here again when in NO.",Good
We ended up staying here last minute when other plans fell through and we were very pleased. It's within walking distance to Seattle Center which makes it great if you're going to the Pacific Science Center which was the reason for our visit. The room was great and the staff was very helpful. It's kind of tucked away in a semi-industrial looking area which concerned me a little bit at first because we had our young children with us but after walking around the neighborhood at night I realized it wasn't a problem. There is a QFC (grocery store) just around the corner which was great for grabbing snacks for the room and a quick bite before we hit Seattle Center. You can walk to Pike Market from here but it's about 1.5 miles away. We just walked there during the day and took a cab back to the hotel at night. All in all I enjoyed the stay there and would recommend it if you want to be in the Seattle Center area.,Good
"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this Hotel. With Best Western, I only expect a place to sleep and shower. This hotel is a notch above other Best Westerns. We were helped by Dean at the front desk and he made us feel welcomed and answered all our questions. We appreciated the friendly check-in experience as we came from a hotel where front desk staff was rude and made us feel like an interruption. As a BW Gold member, we were also upgraded to a room with a nice view. The Spanish Hacienda architecture is charming and room furnishings were nice. Of course this is an older property and there is some wear and tear. You should consider staying here if you can get a rate 125. The location is perfect. You are right across the street from Mormon Battalion Historic Site and they run an awesome tour I'm not affiliated with LDS and they did not try to proselytize. There are numerous lively mexican restaurants in teh neighborhood and this was the perfect location to stay.Thank you for choosing to stay with us and your loyalty to Best Western. Your feedback is important and we really appreciate you drawing attention to the service you received from Dean while checking in. We want you (and all guests) to feel like a very important guest while you are here and that starts with warm responsive service. Thank you again for staying and please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can assist you with.",Good
I had booked this hotel for my mom on a last min. when i tryed to call to see if my mom checked in thay did not ansewer the phones for about 2 hrs straight had to call the 800 to see if she got there.. she had told me the next morning that the room smelled musty and was not as clean she expected paying 100.00 + for the night we will say we will not be back there...,Bad
"On the drive to the Field Museum in Chicago for a family outing the weather turned from a drizzle of rain to ice snow. Knowing that it would be impossible to return home that night we stopped at a rest area made a reservation at the Comfort Suites on Michigan Avenue. After a day of exploring exhibits, we left the museum campus in miserable weather but were treated to a magnificent night at this fantastic hotel. Not only was the location perfect for the view convenience to destinations, the room was large (and included a washer dryer in the closet to handle the wet clothes), the staff was friendly helpful the breakfast more than filled the boys. We've already made two more reservations for this location. Dear grandmaw2016,Thank you for your recent 5 star review. We are so happy that you enjoyed our location, room and breakfast. That is great you made multiple reservations for future stays. Thank you! We love our returning guests.We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",Good
"One of the biggest surprises we have had during our travels in northern Michigan is finding this wonderful river hideaway.

"Paid 600 a night because it was jazzfest. King Bourbon Street Balcony room. Expected a private balcony on Bourbon Street as I had called several times to confirm this fact. When we checked in there was some sort of problem and the guy leaves to go into a back room to straighten something out. At that point we knew there was some sort of issue. He comes back to the counter and tells us we have the most requested room in the hotel. Sounds pretty good, right Nope. Got a corner room on Toulouse and Bourbon with a SHARED balcony. Of course because of the balcony location on the corner, everyone wanted to sit right in front of our balcony door even though the tables in front of their balcony doors were empty. I was told there was nothing I could do about it because it was a shared balcony. BUMMER. I wouldn't have paid 600 a night for a shared anything. It truly sucked. When I asked the front desk to please ask the people in front of my door to move to the table in front of their own door I was rudely told it was a shared balcony and there was nothing I could do about it. Then the guy proceeded to hang up on me. LOL Because I'm a member of Starwood I called and complained. They credited me with 12,000 points (which is good for a free nights' stay in most of their hotels) but I would have preferred to just cut my losses and be refunded for all three nights so I could get out of there.The room was tiny and so thrashed. Look at the photos. Torn curtains hanging. Beat up furniture, missing hooks in bathroom, mold in bathroom, shower rod hanging off of cracked shower tiles. The batteries kept falling out of the safe so they came and duct taped them in. Yes, they actually duct taped it. Seriously, the place is a dive. There was no heat (A/C stuck on blast) and no hot water. They were not happy that we wanted it fixed. They never did fix the heat but they eventually did come and take the faucet apart in the bathroom and we had hot water after two days of no hot water.I will say... the lobby area and common areas are actually really nice. The staff is very rude and acts like everything is an inconvenience to them but the lobby really is nice.I'm not sensitive to noise so I have no complaints about that. However, there is a club on each corner of this particular room and they go loud until 4am. Like I said, doesn't bother me but just something to be aware of. I like the loud music and party atmosphere and the bed was comfortable so I had no problem sleeping.Don't waste your money. This is a one star hotel charging five star prices.Thank you TnCWenzl for your feedback. On behalf of the Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter, please accept my apology for the inconvenience you experienced with us during your recent stay. We strive to ensure our guests experience the best visits possible during their travels and we fell short of our goal this time. We hope you give us another try on your next trip to New Orleans!",Bad
"A great hotel for convenient access to theaters and restaurants in the Chicago west loop area. The hotel is compact and does not have some of the soaring architectural features of other Hyatts, but location and price served our purpose very well.Thank you Michael K for the feedback on your stay with us.

"Filthiest hotel I've ever stayed at. Room service didn't change the sheets once during a 5 night stay, they only replaced towels. Door didn't close properly allowing loud noises to enter room 24/7. Phone and alarm clock didn't work. Half the lights didn't work. Literal holes in wall, peeling paint. Disgusting.",Bad

It's a very nice hotel for the price. Its updated and appeared very modern. Valet is 25 or you have to find public parking. Check-in was nice easy and staff is friendly. Room 512 was very modern looking. There is no carpet it's all concrete floors but it does have rugs. Bathroom was nice and clean. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Only negative about the bed was the metal frame around it. We hit our knees a couple times on it so that was unpleasant. The lobby Bar was great with good happy hour food and drinks. Rail station stop is across the street. We took Lyft to the Arena which was about 5 mins away. Went to Club Luxx (which is a block away) after for a concert after party. Club was great with great music. Checkout was a breeze and breakfast in the lobby was good. Thank you Jesus! We're happy to hear you had a great experience.,Good

"This hotel was wonderful. The staff was excellent and even though we had a car, we never used it due to the location in the downtown area and the shuttle that took us to the other places we wanted to go.

"Our flight was cancelled and we went to another facility and found it unfavorable. We called Hampton Inn and they had accommodations. they got us in fast, were professional, sympathetic, and helpful. We appreciated too that the towel with Hershey Kisses made it feel inviting and like home. A warm welcome. Our flight was scheduled to the next day and they allowed us to stay in the room until 1:30 pm then remain in the lobby/breakfast area until we were ready to go. We felt safe.Thank you for your kind words and feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We look forward to a serving you again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales",Good
"Had a quick stay here last week. Very nice overall.Check in was quick and easy. Was in my room within 10 minutes of walking into the hotel. Very nice room upgrade given. Concierge level room with great views of Midtown/Downtown as well as part of the Buckhead skyline. Room was large with a separate sitting area with couch, chair, and coffee table. Work desk was large and bed was comfortable and provided a great rest. The bathroom was spacious also. Had a separate tub and shower, with marble floors/sink. As I was only here for a brief time, I did not get a chance to check out the fitness or pool areas. Also did not have any experience with room service or hotel restaurant dining. I did have a couple of drinks in the hotel bar, and the service was friendly and efficient. For being surrounded by a huge mall with a lot of parking, I was a little disappointed that this hotel charged 17/day for parking. I live in Atlanta so I don't often stay in hotels in the area. If and when I need a Buckhead hotel again, this will be my choice. Prices generally seem more reasonable than some other hotels in the area with similar levels of quality service.",Good
"We stayed one night at this hotel - it was the first visit at a Hilton which I enjoyed a lot. The rooms were spotless and the outdoor pool at the patio was very enjoyable.We were 7 of us, arriving quite early and they were able to accommodate us almost immediately and have the two rooms done up quickly . THe staff was very friendly and courteous. We will definitely stay there again.Thanks so much for your terrific review. I am so glad our team made you feel welcome and that your suite had everything you needed to make you feel at home. We all are about impressing the guest and it appears we did just that in your case.

"This is an excellent 5 star hotel near downtown Miami. It's on a small island connected to downtown, but it feels safe and the entire island is made up of high end properties.The hotel room that we had was very large, clean and plush. We also had a balcony with a really nice view of Miami on a high floor. This was really romantic with my wife since we were on our honeymoon. We loved every moment at this hotel.The pricing is very affordable in the summer. The staff was excellent. We had dinner at Azul and the view was perfect. The food and service was excellent, and of course it was expensive. South Beach and American Airlines Arena is very close by, but you will need a car. The Bayside marketplace is also a good place to visit. Overall, this is a great 5 star with an excellent location. Quieter than staying at South Beach, but close enough to all the fun places.",Good

"My family and I visit La Jolla every year for the Challenged Athletes Foundation Triathlon. We try different hotels every year. This year we stayed at the beautifully appointed Pantai Inn. Our room was very well renovated with a full kitchen and awesome bathroom. Spacious and clean, but the master bed was a double and too small for comfort. My daughter slept on the Murphy Bed. Unfortunately, we heard every noise from the upstairs unit. The jumping, walking and screaming was very unsettling and kept us from relaxing. There was a beeping noise outside our bedroom the entire which kept us from sleeping. To say the least the location is great and property really nice, but we wouldn't suggest staying there for a romantic, relaxing or quiet weekend. Dear Friend,Thank you so much for your comments, we appreciating hearing from our guests.I am truly sorry to hear your stay at Pantai Inn was disrupted by the guests in the room above you. The Inn was sold out that weekend for the Challenged Athletes Foundation Triathlon. If we would have had another room we would have gladly upgraded you to something that was not below other guests. I hope you understand this is not a normal occurrence at the Inn. Most of our guests come here for a quiet romantic getaway and hopefully you will give us another opportunity to serve you again. If you would, please contact me by email at danpantai.com, or telephone directly (858)224-7620 to discuss this further. Thank you for your comments and I truly hope to hear from you.With warm regards,Dan Priano",Neutral

We only stayed for 3 nights and wanted to pack in a lot of activities.

"Here's the short version of my 5 nights at this hotel. King bed was bottomed out on one side..the other side was fine so I just slept on the one good side. No hot water 2nd day for about 2 hours--right after I got back from the gym needed that shower so that put my drive to L.A. back 2 hours. (hair dryer didn't work). There was a leaky ceiling in the lobby dripping into a floor basket--and what ever caused that problem seemed to affect my room water service. When the hot water went down the toilet stopped flushing properly--that lasted 2 days before being fixed. The breakfast here was poor. Each morning there was a basket of black bananas there were the usual sweets (muffins and frosted sugary treats). There was some kind of weird egg that was folded to look like a mini omelette--stuffed with orange cheese. It was kind of rubbery and tasted weird. The potatoes were dry and kind of like tator tots. I just stayed with coffee and juice after the 1st day. There was a front desk person that kept referring to me as boss...no problem boss you got it boss, etc. I thought that was unprofessional and a demeaning term. You may use the term boss on a construction site or road crew, but not in a professional environment. When I checked out the lady at registration didn't even ask how my stay was..or wish me a good trip as I left..I felt she could care less. You have MANY options during your stay in San Diego. So consider your plans before booking here. By the way this hotel is located on a very busy street. Lots of traffic noise as Harbor Drive is a main road traveled coming out of the airport. This whole area is heavily impacted by traffic.",Bad
"Pros: CleanlinessCons: Needs more handrails around property and highlighted painting of uneven sidewalk areas.Location: Everything to do in San Diego is an easy 15 minute car ride from this motel. Sea World, the Zoo, the beaches, etc all within 15 minutes.The motel is right off the freeway and while you could hear some freeway noise it wasn't too bad. The motel room was extremely clean. The housekeeping staff here works extra hard to keep the rooms maintained well. The biggest issue of the room was that it was small think bedroom size small. It fits 2 Queen beds and a little night stand, but there isn't any room to walk around the beds. There is a small 3 drawer dresser and a little table and chair. The bathroom is small to the point that you bump the door as you are turning around. However, I would rather have a small clean room than a large dirty one. If you have mobility issues then know that this hotel needs to improve on a few things. One is that they have uneven sidewalks that are not painted or highlighted in anyway so you may be walking and there is a slope that causes a misstep. For someone with mobility issues this could lead to a fall or accident. The other issue is there are no handle rails for the walkway between the office and the pool. So you have to use the wall to steady yourself as you are going up/down those stairs. Breakfast consists of waffles, bagels, muffins, bread/toast, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs and cereals. The dining room can only seat about 20 people so that can be tricky. It appears SDSU is 1 stop to the east of this location with easy freeway access. About a block up the road (north) on Waring there are some convenience stores, restaurants and a little grocery store.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We understand your concerns and I have forwarded your feedback with the management team regarding your concerns. Again, thank your review and hope to see you again soon.",Good

We couldn't believe how close it was to everything we wanted to do in New Orleans, including Bourbon St, the Aquarium and the Riverboat dock. Highly recommend this hotel.",Good
"This is one of the hotels our company uses for our Dallas airport stays, so we stay here about four times a month. I have mixed feelings. In general, I like the rooms a lot. They are clean and have fairly modern finishes. They have a good sized kitchenette with a large refrigerators, however, many of them are broken. Instead of fixing them, they have placed a lot of small fridges in the room as well, but not all, so if you need a fridge check to see if it works after checking into your room. Also, a lot of the rooms have Air conditioners that don't work properly, this is a big problem in Dallas in the summertime. On my last stay, two nights ago, I had one of theses rooms with a faulty A/C unit and broken fridge. The A/C seemed to work in the first hour, so I unpacked all my things and it was late in the evening, about 11pm. By the time I noticed it started to get very hot in the room it was too late to pack up all my things ( I had an extremely long work day and was exhausted ). I called the front desk and no one answered the first call even though I let it ring for awhile. I tried back and a very surly man answered like he was very bothered and annoyed. I told him the A/C wasn't working and also the fridge was broken. Silence. I could almost here the 'So, what do you want me to do about it' in his thoughts! After an awkward silence, he said to hold on. He then sent someone up to change my room which I declined because of the time and effort. That same night checking in, there was a different clerk who seemed um, medicated let's say, she was very harried and distracted and had trouble checking a two of us in, she couldn't seem to get her thoughts straight, it was pretty strange. I would hope they could get their staff to act in a more professional manner. I have to say their shuttle drivers are awesome, very prompt and friendly. Maybe they should put the shuttle drivers behind the front desk and make the front desk clerks the shuttle drivers Just an idea.",Neutral
"This was perhaps the nicest Best Western I have stayed in, at least in the top FIVE. The King Suites was very nice. It was spacious, well kept, clean, and comfortable.

"We stayed here for 5 nights and we're greeted by friendly helpful staff. Central location is within walking distance to canal st, french market, river, hop on hop off bus (this gets you to lots of other places) etc. Lots of stuff happening at night on the street outside, this is party central so be prepared. We got a room overlooking the internal courtyard so the noise was not an issue for us (and they provided ear plugs). If you have a street balcony room you can watch the action but probably extremely noisy.Only thing was we had to request more milk - each day they provided enough coffee for 2 people but only milk for one. Not a major issue and we sorted it when the housekeeper came.Got food from room service once and this was great. Food in some surrounding places not good. Some places look quite dodgy, wouldn't want to eat there. Would stay again if needed.Thank you Russdi for taking the time to provide your feedback. We are so pleased to hear you enjoyed your five night stay with us, that our staff was able to take care of your needs, and the food was great.

"We were staying here for a seminar. I contacted the hotel and left messages for a return phone call for the seminar rate. I had to push to get a return call. Spoke with the sales manager and requested a room with a king bed. Upon arrival, they had booked us in a queen bed room. Staff was not friendly and we were told they were totally booked so were were stuck with the queen room. The hotel was noisy during the day due to construction and public bathrooms were out of order. I had asked for a bottle of water at the desk and you have thought I asked for the world. Not impressed at all.We're sorry we didn't provide the high quality of services you deserve.

The staff was excellent and the room was amazing. We had a huge room on the 25th floor with a view of the sound as well as the Space Needle. This was the first time we actually spent a great deal of time in the room since the view was spectacular. I would absolutely stay there again should we return to Seattle. IN ALL CAPS TOO, I LOVE IT!

"Spent 45 minutes booking directly with Kimpton, with another 15 directly with the hotel only to discover 30 seconds on TripAdvisor would have yielded a better rate. An no, they don't price match, they just talk around the problem. We arrived to find a room so tiny it didn't even have a closet. We inquired, and I guess closets are for higher level Karma members. Only one robe was met with a promise that we wouldn't be charged for the second (Want a robe each Stay elsewhere.) The nightly screaming and partying from the neighboring room was not met with a room change but an lecture on how thin walls are in Chicago. The second night required security (twice) and no offer of a room change. We shortened our stay because it was so awful the dog, who is the greeter for an internationally known corporation and no stranger to noise, was so tired he couldn't walk, drink or eat. Bringing a dog to this hotel isn't a perk, it's animal abuse. My daughter was so tired and stressed because she was giving a presentation, she started to cry. Now for the amenities: there is coffee in the lobby in the morning because there are no coffee makers in room. Want tea in the evening Go buy some. There is a 10 in room certificate for Karma members, but that's 1 per stay, and the bottled water isn't free, it's 9. Want bottled water Try Walgreens. There is, like most mid level hotels, a wine reception from 5-6 ( shorter than most chains) but unlike most chains, there aren't even pretzels. Want a piece of cheese, fruit, vegetables or a chip Again, Walgreens. If you think this is a boutique hotel interested in offering a great vacation experience, you are very wrong. This is a for profit entity interested in warehousing corporate employees for a profit. There are two reasons to stay here: one is if your company is paying and you don't have a choice (you will then earn your road warrior status) or if there are absolutely no other rooms available in the entire City of Chicago. And then, check TripAdvisor for the best rate. And if there's a problem, don't waste your time complaining or going to management or even contacting corporate. This is a corporate hotel that caters to corporations. Individuals are irrelevant. You will get lip service but they truly couldn't care less.Thanks for taking time to provide feedback from your stay. We're sorry to see you had a less than excellent experience and would love to discuss the issues you experienced further, as this is certainly not the norm for our property.

"We stayed at the Hotel Diva for 4 nights in early-mid October and it met nearly all of our expectations, and exceeded plenty.The service was the standout - all the staff we dealt with were professional, but also friendly and sometimes jovial - they seemed to enjoy working there which is always a good sign. The location is great - whilst not ON Union Square it is close enough to walk to the main shopping areas as well as public transport systems like the Muni and BART. It's always one of the main things we look for in a hotel and Diva definitely ticked that box for us.The only thing we were a bit surprised about was the size of the rooms - they are quite small, although we only booked their cheapest so this may not be the same in the pricier rooms. We had been warned though that all hotel rooms in San Fran are tiny so we got over it and utilised the quite reasonable amount of storage space and it was fine. Also took a bit of getting used to having the basin and vanity outside of the bathroom! I guess a creative way to use the space. The decor of the room as with the hotel is modern and trendy which we liked.As for the price we thought it was quite good value for money, despite our 4th night being much more expensive - being a Saturday night and also over Fleet week and with the President's Cup golf on this was understandable.We are travellers that love variety so usually try out different hotels, but the next time we are in San Fran we will strongly consider staying at Diva again.",Good

"My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis for six nights while visiting San Francisco. I spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel for this trip. After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the touristy crowd. Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service. From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive. The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans. The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name. Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful. Kane was our server on most mornings. When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special breakfast dessert. To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate. The service made it truly a memorable stay. I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels.Dear Kingtrips,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I pleased to hear that you and your husband had an exceptional experience and I sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our service and your high recommendation of our hotel.

"My family and I stayed here for one night during our road trip. Our room was clean and set up nicely, but space was limited. They charged 18/night for your car, and security is tight so you have to run out to your car to put out a tag so they don't boot it. The lobby is also very secure, you need your key just to get inside the door. I went to the gym downstairs and there were 3 treadmills, 1 elliptical, weights, a mat and a bike. The equipment was pretty new but you could tell it was well used. There was 1 treadmill that was not working, and one of the employees was trying to help me get it started but unfortunately they needed to call in order to have someone come out to fix it. Overall, it was a decent workout facility for a hotel, no frills but definitely usable.One of the downsides to our room was our shower, the water flow was very low and it felt like a slight mist while you were in the shower. I understand this may be more environmentally friendly, but in the meantime I spend more time in the shower trying to get clean....On the other hand, when we requested more towels and an extra blanket, there was an employee at our door in well under 5 minutes. We went down to the breakfast (which is included) around 8:30am and it was already really crowded, and it was a Saturday. My advice is to get there early, especially when it closes at 10am!! There were a variety of healthy options. There was hot oatmeal, waffles, muffins, bananas, apples, honeydew/pineapple/grapes. The oatmeal was slightly cool by the time I got to it--part of the reason why I suggest getting there early. There were 4 different types of cereal to choose from, regular cheerios included.Overall, for the price of the hotel and the central location, you can't beat it. However, I'm not sure what the other hotels in the area are like, so I can only compare this location to other Hampton Inns I've stayed in in the past.",Neutral

"I booked a special rate to include parking and 50 in food and drink. The hotel billed for both. Upon checkout I had to remind them to take off the 75 parking and then a week later I received charges for a brunch and water in the room. After calling, they credited the brunch, but would not take off the 3 for a water in the room (not included as a drink). Amazing that after all the hassle, the 3 charge was not credited.Nice atmosphere, but with this type of customer service I will stay elsewhere going forward.Hello dwyejj, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Found:re Phx.

"The location was great- we were right on Bourbon and in (what felt like) the middle of the French Quarter. The hotel was safe, I appreciated that there was security at the entrance at night (even Sunday and Monday night) to keep out non guests. The hotel staff was very helpful. We repeatedly asked for suggestions and got great places as well as directions. The hotel was clean. The pool wasn't large but it was nice, equal parts of shade and sun available. Try using the concierge to book your tours, you could get money off. I wish the shampoo, conditioner and body gel didn't smell so masculine but I did appreciate the eco friendly refillable bottles in the shower instead of the travel bottles.

This helped a lot, especially since we were also travelling with a toddler, who went to bed earlier than us. Very quiet room on the centre courtyard area.

"I stayed here for a night, to attend a meeting held at the hotel. The room was very good. The staff was excellent. Even thought all of the rooms empty out into the courtyard area, it still is fairly quiet (thankfully). The hotel itself is well located, there is plenty of parking, and there are many options for eating within the hotel. The breakfast buffet was pretty good and that was a decent price for a buffet (14). The only complaint I have is they charge a small fortune for most everything! A 20 ounce soft drink is 3.49, A small bag of chips or pretzels are 2 for 3.49. Ok, most people might not care, but to me, if I am paying a decent amount for the room, why do I need to be gouged for every day itemsI don't believe I will stay here again, unless there is another business meeting, to which I need to attend.Thank you for your feedback, it truly helps us improve our product and services.

"Absolutely beautiful, full kitchen,large tub, beautiful bathroom,bedroom spacious, double bedrooms, was a free upgrade I think, grounds lovely, Last trip was for purely relaxation and destressing which we accomplished.Appreciate the non pressure sales to buy in the timeshare program. You had to go to them, not the the other way around. Already have a timeshare with Westin.No desire to add on more maintenance fees. Definitely would recommend going down to this resort is just lovely down there even though we went on the tail end of the last tropical storm it still is just wonderful .Aloha Mae456,Mahalo nui loa for your great review. We are delighted that you found beauty and relaxation during your stay despite the tropical storm. As you know, we can't have rainbows without the rain and this last storm certain made the most exquisite sunsets and rainbows galore. We look forward to seeing you again and again. A L O H A",Good
"I looked forward to staying at this hotel for so long and I was so disappointed. My room never got cleaned, the young lady at the front desk on Friday was just plain rude when answering questions about the hotel. There were numerous areas of the hotel that needed attention badly. From a distance it looks beautiful, but up close the hotel was just plain dirty and run-down. I fully realize this Best Western because of it's location does a huge volumn of business, which is all the more reason that things should be kept in much better condition. I would love to visit again because the views are wonderful and the beds are comfortable. However, the water running all night as well as the unkept grounds and bad service may cause me to change my mind. I am afront office manager at another BW location and I simply can't believe the things I saw and heard during my visit to this property.",Bad
"Thank you for your part in making our visit to Coeur d'Alene great. SpringHill Suites was an excellent place to stay. It was convenient, clean, very friendly staff, good breakfast and overall just a wonderful place to stay.",Good
"Visiting NOLA for a wedding and had a block of rooms available at Bienville House, took the opportunity due to the low rate and distance from wedding events/bourbon street area. Upon arrival was very suprised by cute street apeal and friendly reception area, after receiving our room key we ventured around the lobby area and found the pool. The pool is in the courtyard area in the middle of the building. It is very grotto like and almost had a european feel with its rustic charm yet small and charming feel. Unfortunatelly, we did not use the pool but did take advantage of the small breakfast bar the next morning in the lobby area that was just enough to get you up and going to take on the town. The room was on the top level which is actually an outdoor hallway terrace that winds around different corners offering a few views of the city. Luckily it was a warm day and we were able sit out on our own patio terrace directly outside our room. Inside the room- very clean and suprisingly large, we shared with another couple and had more than enough room for the 4 of us. The bathroom was a little outdated but it was still functional and clean (most important). Upon checkout we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who knew the city well and helped with out bags by a team of skilled bell staff. Overall- great place to stay, walking distance to anything in the bourbon street area, safe, clean, and offered a comfortable NOLA experience.",Good
Stayed here for a couple of nights in November while visiting relatives nearby.The property is old (quaint if you prefer) but the room was clean and functional.I stayed at the back end of the lobby level so it was quiet and pleasant enough. My only observation was the Wifi in the room didn't work especially well. I think if one were to stay in a room closer to the lobby that problem wouldn't be as much of an issue.I would stay here again.,Good

"The room was basic but clean, quite old fashioned and needs updating but the bed was comfortable enough and we got a quiet nights sleep where we were on the 7th floor. The room was cleaned each morning and fresh towels given. The free buffet breakfast was good, loads of different kinds of bagels, chocolate muffin/cakes, toast, eggs, cereal, tea and coffee. The bagels were the best i've tasted!! The breakfast room was very small and just a kitchen really but was nice and gave me that travelling vibe whilst i made and ate my toast alongside Germans, French and Dutch fellow travellers. One thing i did not like about the hotel was the lift!!! By the second day i was taking the stairs! All 7 flights of them...! The lift is tiny, very scary and just felt like it was about to go at any second! The hotel is situated right next to the Chinatown gateway which is a great location. 5-10 minute walk to Union Square and the main shopping area. One day we walked to the Coit Tower from the hotel and then kept on walking down to Fishermans Warf, if you look at the map you will see we covered some distance but in my opinion - its the best way to explore around. We even walked all the way back!!I was pleased with our stay, for the low price we paid we got a comfortable bed to sleep in, clean bathroom, free breakfast and it was in walking distance for pretty much everything we needed.",Neutral
"My hubby and I stayed here last summer. It is an affordable, no frills place. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was comfy and quiet.

"We stayed for 6 nights in lovely bay view room, which had a quirky semi-open plan bathroom - which could be screened by a blind. Allows you to soak in the large bathtub, and at the same time look out at the bay. Great! This is the first 5 star hotel we have stayed at in the US where the staff are ALL so attentive and it is clear that the hotel is being run along quality Far-East principles, where staff are trained to be helpful and polite. Concierge Paola was a gem, and is a great asset to the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble, and all of her helpful advice about transport, where to eat etc was spot on. Well done. Breakfast servers were also great, and even if the next day we were not at their tables, they still asked us how we were getting on. We would go back in a flash!",Good

"I am an IHG Spire member and when IHG integrated the acquired Kimpton Hotel in 2018, I decided to try one and this is my first Kimpton and I had a great experience. The room is large, very clean, well appointed and super comfortable. Everything is a notch higher than the usual IHG brands - even the bathroom amenity is of very high quality.The hotel is in a great location but can be a challenge for getting food in the evening, and it is very convenient for transportation. Blue Line station bound for the O'Hare Airport is about 2 blocks away and it made catching my morning flight way easier than I expected.I would definitely come back again on my next business trip.",Good
"our stay started off good enough: we were given a room above the parking garage gate which was noisy. They gladly moved us to another room which upon reviewing the bill after checkout, was more expensive and no one said anything at the time. The rooms have microwaves and refrigerators which is very convenient. Room service was actually some of the best service and food we've had at this level hotel. There is a design flaw in the rooms where the bathroom door is in the way of the front door and must remain closed according to OSHA or it will block the front door access. It has a spring loaded hinge to keep it closed. Simple solution: re-hinge the bath door to swing inward instead of out toward the front door. We ended up putting a bag in the door to hold it open. Hope OSHA doesn't find out. Maid service needs to be re-trained: I left a 10 tip for them on the bed and all it got me was my trash not emptied that day. Also, we had our door partially held open, with a do not disturb sign hung out for our guest to return and a maid walked straight in after one quick knock and no waiting! Hello Housekeeping Whatever happened to that phrase This could have been very embarrassing. And the the weird part: on our last evening we started smelling noxious odors from the bathroom...and I mean noxious. I ran water in all the traps, checked the fan and everything seemed to be ok. But the odor persisted. Called the front desk and they said there might be a plumber doing work somewhere causing the odor. No call back, no offer to relocate. The odor came and it went a few times but each time became more fowl. They credited our room for the night which I appreciated but that was it. This odor was in our clothes and our nostrils for days after checkout. They really should have comped our entire stay. Or come up to see what was going on, offered to move us to another room, something other than nothing unless we asked for a credit. Staff was entirely insensitive to our plight. Almost seemed routine. I would give them another try on the basis that I can't have two experiences like this or they'd be out of business.Thank you very much for taking the time to give feedback regarding your recent stay with us.

I had a walk-in shower that was nice. The concierge level suite was good which I visited during hors d'eorves hour before our 7:30pm dinner reservations and also again in the morning for breakfast. There was an excellant spread available with many juice options. I particularily enjoyed that the lamps wall sockets in the room had USB ports to charge your phone/Kindle etc. The cost of the room seemed pretty steep, but I enjoyed my stay overall. Shuttle service from O'Hare was prompt and I think comes every 20 minutes.",Good
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The suite was spacious for our 9 day vacation with a separate bedroom and living room/kitchen. The beds were very comfortable with soft linens and 5 or 6 pillows on the king bed. The complimentary breakfast daily served a variety of hot and cold items including fresh fruit and Mickey Waffles. There was a complimentary meal most evenings including beer, but we did not use that. The staff was friendly and welcoming and responded to our request for extra towels immediately. Very close to Downtown Disney and Orlando attractions. Quiet area. Nice pool area and fitness room. Would definitely recommend to friends and will be back on our next Orlando vacation.",Good

"The reviews were very good so we booked 2 rooms in this hotel for 3 nights. The reception staff was at best indifferent. We had booked a room with 2 double beds for our teenage children and they upgraded us to a king suite with a very uncomfortable pull out sofa. They did not try to accommodate us at all. The croissant in the morning was a bit stale. And the walls are paper thin, in each room we were woken up by people having sex next door almost every night...So apart from a good location and a decent price, I would not recommend this hotel.

"Called the hotel prior arrival to get more info but each time I get someone that's so rude over the phone. When we arrived at the hotel there was a huge line at check-in. The front desk agent was cold and didn't even make eye contact or greet us. We checked into the Annex side of the building...OMG how disgusting the Annex is!!! Better off at Motel 6! The elevator is so old scary...looks like from a horror movie. The hallway leading to our room was dark and dingy with broken lights. We couldn't find our room 205 because there was missing door on our door...we just guessed which room it was and stuck our key in and it worked. The bathroom was a nasty pink color with musty mildew around the dirty gray tub. Bathroom tiles on the floor was old, scratched, stained chipped! I found tiny hairs around the base of the toilet and sink. The carpet wall in the room were full of stains as well. We wore shoes at all times trying to avoid stepping on the stains. We asked for a wakeup call at 9am but they nevered called to wake us up. We woke up late at 10:30am and missed breakfast. Called the front desk to complain about not recieving a wake up call got Garry over the phone he implied that maybe we overselpt the wakeup call...His implications were RUDE obnoxious! I asked him for a late checkout and he offered extra 30min...How cheap stingy is that! Most hotels in AC have a 12pm checkout time... this place offers 11am checkout with 30mins late checkout! CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP! Tropicana offered me 4pm late checkout once FREE of charge. I will never stay at this disgusting place again! AVOID at all cost!",Bad
"We chose to stay at the French Market Inn largely based on reviews we read here on Trip Advisor. All reviews we read here are accurate, so we knew in advance what to expect. The location is superb for leisure travelers. Close to the French Market, Jax Brewery, Jackson Square and the Cathedral. The Natchez steamboat is just across the street. Easy walking distance to shopping, good restaurants and the activities of the French Quarter. Valet parking was a breeze. Check-in was smooth. The lobby is beautiful. Every single member of staff we encountered provided great customer service. Lonnie is great - he is everywhere all at once. We loved Patrick the cat, but only had the chance to meet him at night. When you read other reviews that the rooms are small, they are not kidding. It is what it is, just be forewarned - this we expected based on reading the reviews here. On the plus side, our shower was fantastic and probably the best water pressure I've ever had in any hotel anywhere in the world - that was a pleasant surprise. Beds were very comfortable. There is no bar or restaurant on the premises, but there is a lovely courtyard where people gather to relax and bring their own beverage. Nice little pool - it is on the small side. Vending machines and ice maker are in a room facing the courtyard.The French Market Inn is definitely good value for money, and we plan on staying here again on our next visit to NOLA.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your valuable feedback - we're happy to hear that your stay met your expectations.

"The front desk staff needs an introduction to providing better customer service they do what they think their job is, but without any real consideration for the guest in front of them. The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast.",Neutral

"My stay was better than expected. It was unusual that check-in is on the top floor, but it didnt bother me (although the wait for the elevator can be a bit slow). I agree with one reviewer who commented that the hotel was a little confused on their design. The top floor (as pictured on their website) has a very nice contemporary feel a really good first impression. However, when I arrived on the 14th floor where my room was located, it felt like Gumbys grandma was hired to design it. Whoever chose this designer must have owed someone a HUGE favor because I have never seen lime green in that quantity. I would not have mentioned the dcor if I was at some cheap hotel in Vegas but I think it was strangely (and noticeably) out of place here. Despite that, the room met expectation, given the location. For the most part, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. If you look a little closer, you can definitely spot some noticeable wear and tear, but nothing that really bothered me. There were some perks that made the stay more comfortable a loofah scrub for the shower, disposable slippers and complimentary bottled water just to name a few. Outside the room, all the staff I spoke with were all pleasant and helpful. I had dinner (once) and breakfast (twice) at the restaurant XIX and found the food excellent each time. I would definitely eat there again. The location of the hotel is excellent 5-10 minutes walking distance from the Walnut Street entrance: Rittenhouse Square to the left, the Historical District to the right, the Theater District just down Broad street and the Convention Center up the street. I encourage using a taxi instead of renting a car as it looked like parking is a premium (I think I saw a sign at a parking lot that said 3.25 for every 20 minutes). One important thing: If you are a light sleeper and not used to the city sounds I recommend bringing ear plugs. The three days I spent there I could barely sleep a wink because I was constantly woken up by the sounds of sirens below (theres a hospital nearby). On the second night, I was woken up by what I think was street cleaning around 4 or 5 in the morning. It sounded like an alarm clock beeping for what felt like half an hour.I wouldnt mind staying here again if I was on business (i.e. company pays). Its a little pricey for what you get.",Good
"Hotel was clean, well maintained, and mostly quiet even though there was a large group attending a weekend event (Battle of Atlanta). Our King Bed room was spacious and the bed was among the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel. The hotel was within walking distance to Suntrust Park utilizing a new pedestrian bridge that crossed over the Interstate. It was well lit and I felt very safe because there were many people that used this bridge after the Braves game was over. The hotel is also convenient to Cumberland Mall across the street, also accessible by another pedestrian bridge. Numerous restaurants and shopping opportunities.Overall a very good stay at this hotel.Dear 805ronaldw,Thank you for your kind comments about the guest room cleanliness and for being spacious. Our housekeeping team strives to provide an outstanding experience for all of our guests.The proximity to the Battery / SunTrust Park is a wonderful aspect to the Renaissance. I am thrilled to hear you were able to discover something wonderfully new across the bridge.I look forward to seeing you next year.George",Good
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We both slept well!! This was a first as we never sleep well when out. Pleasant, quiet, comfortable, and clean. Not a lot of frills but everything we needed. Has a pool and hot tub. Helpful staff. Surprised to find restaurants, stores, Starbucks more in close walking distance. Easy access to Route 29, and a bike path that leads into town. We were guests of our son, but he stays here often on business. He told us Chablis Inn offered the best quality for the money.",Good
"We had a really nice time staying at the French Market Inn. It was walking distance to everything you want to see in the French Quarter and had a lot of character. It can seem confusing when you're looking online because it is actually a series of several buildings all linked by a courtyard, but they provided us a map and clear directions to find our room. We were in an outer building which was an old building but cool in a historic kind of way. We stayed in an interior room (thanks, other TripAdvisor reviewers, for putting our mind at ease about that!) - it really was not a big deal. The only consideration is that the sun will not wake you in the morning, but in every other way it felt like other hotel rooms. The only issue we encountered was that our room didn't seem to be serviced as completed as I might have liked - we ran out of towels and plastic cups and even though I requested them, they were never actually replenished. We made do and didn't feel like it was worth a big fuss. Staff at the front desk were always very friendly and welcoming. We enjoyed feeling so central to all the NOLA fun and took an hour at one point to just enjoy the courtyard and relax. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, especially if you're looking for a more unique experience!Hi Whitney, thank you for recommending the French Market Inn. We value your feedback about our historic property and are thrilled you enjoyed your time with us in the French Quarter. We're constantly working to improve our guest experience, and the comments about your accommodations are being addressed. We look forward to welcoming you back to our New Orleans hotel soon.",Good

"Great location and great service...Beautiful courtyard with a pool, fountain, and serene sitting areas..Daily breakfast with traditional eggs, sausages, cereals, oatmeal etc. We stayed there 4 nights and were feeling at home.. Friendly and very knowledgeable staff, swift taxi services offered ( if required).. Hotel is older but do not get taken aback by that: this is New Orleans and this hotel fits right in..It is romantic and slightly decadent.. If you are looking for top notch modernity, you are in a wrong city...Surrounding area is safe to walk at night just be aware of your surroundings and do not walk alone ( usual principles of walking at night in many other cities in the world)...I am so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay at our hotel. Our staff takes our Best Western Mantra of stay with people who care to heart.

"Carpets/rooms are too perfumed/scented for me. Not good for some with sensitivities to scents such as myself and for use of my CPAP machine for sleep apnea since the scent gets absorbed into my machne filters. Please consider getting a fragrence free deoderizer for carpets/rooms or at least a very lightly scented one. The overpowering scents also made me nauseated from time to time. Breakfast had a fairly good assortment, but could use a change in the egg product. The eggs taste too much like a reconstituted procseed egg product for me. The fresh toast sticks available at times were a great addition to breakfast. The front desk staff were exceptional and provided awesome friendly service. Shuttle personel also great and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying that has a family member at Medical City Hospital.Dear 721jeffreygu,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central.

"im a bit late writing this but ah well, we went to orlando as part of our honeymoon last year, (20 may) we wanted a hotel near the main attractions and somewhere to sleep. this hotel was clean, the staff were very help full, its in a fantastic location....6 for a taxi to universal, r a 10 min walk. ..disney is a lot further away but we were not so interested in that. the staff were always helpfull if we needing information. the hotel is across from wet and wild, there is an ihop bus stop outside, plenty food places, and there are a few bus routes too.the only downside of the hotel was the breakfast, it was only toast and cereal....but to be quite honest there are so so many cheap food places around that you dont nee dto have breakfast in the hotelit is a busy hotel, there were a lot of kids there when we were, which could be quite annoying.....but everyone is there to have a good time!!! our room was cleaned every day and we got fresh towels....there is a plaque in the bedroom, if you want your bed stripped then you put it on the bed, we only done this once, and the bed was stripped and made fresh.......all the people moaning about not having a stripped and fresh bed everyday....do you do that at home i doubt it, so why moan about it on holidaythey have free wi-fi in the lobby and at certain areas by the pool.i would stay at this hotel again no bother, its good value for money, its a basic hotel and you have to keep this in mind when you go, if your looking for a good location, and a clean hotel its great!!! :)",Good
"I had a business trip that required me to go to the airport the night before with a 4: 30 am shuttle to the airport the next morning.

"Hotel has one of the best locations for doing things downtown. Good breakfast selection and as the hotel was fairly crowded they had a person dedicated to refilling all items and she was on the spot in doing so. Room was the standard level with the Hampton brand.

We are currently working to increase the number of associates at the front desk for a quicker check-in process.

"This is clearly convenient to the airport. The facility is what you would expect for a Hampton Inn. I found that my key didn't work when I got to my room. I went down stairs to get it exchanged. The clerk told me I must have had it too close to my cell phone. (I found it strange that she had to make an excuse for it. I hadn't even brought my phone out of the car yet. I wasn't miffed). Later, I found that we needed covers for the pull out couch. I went back down stairs again to ask for them. She wrote it down told me housekeeping would be up shortly. They never came. They needed more staff to cover the number people coming through the location.Thank you for your feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport.

"Been to this JW Marriott many times. They did a nice remodel and the staff are friendly, HOWEVER this time, we booked a room for THREE and received an upgrade to a larger room but with only ONE bed and a pullout couch. The couch was not comfortable for our 12 year old. The corner room smelled very musty, there was not enough towels for three either. Frustrating when you are a marriott member, they have your profile, you book a room for three and they can't even have enough towels and only one housecoat. Very disappointed this time!I would like to sincerely apologize for the disappointment in your recent visit. I have personally followed up with our team to address the service and housekeeping issues you have shared. Our engineering team is also checking the sensors and air conditioning in our corner rooms.

"We initially reserved a street view balcony room. After one night of no sleep due to the noise, we asked to move to another room. Luckily they were able to move us to a courtyard room and we were much happier there. Rooms are on the small side, since these are old buildings. Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was good sized. Rooms and common areas showing a bit of wear and tear. Could use some paint and carpet cleaning. Courtyard was lovely with a small pool. There is also a pool room with bathroom and vending machines.

"While the room itself was clean enough, with newly renovated bathrooms, it stank of Lysol, and since I would not advise leaving the windows open, given the homeless people and drug addicts who wander around the open halls here, the rooms can be quite stuffy. But the problem is less the room, but rather the kinds of people that management allow to stay in the rooms. We stayed next door to Room 29 which is blatantly a brothel with people coming and going all night, and I even got solicited one night for some fun by a prostitute in the parking lot. Random people knocking on our door at 5am, smashing bottles outside the door, people arguing and fighting in the middle of the night. Rows of homeless people sleeping around the sides of the building. While they do have a security guard who wanders around, he does not do very much. The area is not dangerous per se, as we would come back for nights out on the town late at night and no one bothers you walking the streets as long as you mind your business. I could go on, but do yourself a favor, and dig into you pocket, pay a few dollars more, and stay away from this place. That way, you can actually enjoy your stay in SF.",Bad

"I stayed at the Best Western Miramar off the 15 since it was close my daughter's house. The room was large with a king size bed and couch that made into a sleeper, clean and the service was good. The breakfast was the usual type that is provided from 6-9 am at hotels and fine for me. The rate was very good for the San Diego area since it not located outside of the main tourist area but the location adjacent to the 15 means that all the major tourist sites and beach is within 20-30 minutes.

Front desk staff were very friendly and eager to please. Free hotel shuttle anywhere within one mile of the hotel was helpful for getting to and from the waterfront and Pike Place market. Hotel decor was too cold and masculine for what I would expect from a Hyatt. Only two elevators made for a long wait to get down to the lobby in the mornings. Breakfast in the lobby bar was pretty good. Only had one delicious made-to-order omelette though because the wait was so long I gave up.

"We stayed four nights at this hotel in June and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was transformed from an apartment building and used to serve mainly visitors of patients of the Virginia Mason Hospital and Medical Center. The layout of our room was a little different than the typical hotel. We had a relatively small room, a big closet,and a bothroom with a window. The staff were polite and professional. We also enjoyed the restaurant at the first floor. They have a small menu, but everything we had were very good. The servers were very friendly as well. The hotel is within walking distance to the Pike Place, Pinoeer Square, and China Town, and the Space Needle. We picked this hotel because of the reasonable price and we wanted to avoid driving in downtown. The entire stay exceeded our expectations in terms of the service we received and the overall experience.Good Morning Traveler - Thank you for being our guest in June!

"Pacific Shores has the nearby beach going for it. That said, if you want to be more centrally located to the main San Diego area you may be disappointed here. It is just off of Pacifc Beach which is directly North of Mission beach. They are both just North of Mission Bay and Sea World. That means they are also well North of the San Diego harvour area, the downtown and Blaboa Park. We found the drive to Sea World to be easy with routes to Mission Bay right down Mission Boulvard or over Grand Street to Ingrahm Ave. We tried the beach both off of the motel at pacific beach and down near Belmont Park on Mission beach. The Mission beach area is a little better for kids. Both are well patroled by lifeguards and the ocean surf is warm and fun to play in. We spent three nights at Pacific Shores. The motel is going through some growing pains with upgrading going on. One afternoon after returnign from the beach we were kept oput of returnign to our room while maintenance was replacing a light switch with sensor switch. This was late in the afternoon at a time when they should expect the guests may want to return to thier rooms. The timing was bad. The last night we spent the smoke alarm batery gave out around midnight and the device began emitting loud alarms. A call to thew dsk brought someont tot eh room aroun 1:00AM, We had to small boys with us trying to sleep. The man replaced the bsattery in the smoke dector and wehn away. A hald horu later it began letting off a short blast every hour or so for the rest of the night! We has a restless night and the kids were not happy. Complaining to the manager lead to the expalnation that the battery was probably not put in properly, sorry about that. No adjustment was offered on our rate but he did say if we come back again to call him and he would give us a better rate next time. Overall while the location may be out of the way to some we enjoyed the proximity of the beaches, the overall casual atmosphere of the area. The motel manager also mentioned that upgrades are planned to replace the pool area and improve the overall motel. The cost is reasonable, the weather is always great and if that darn smoke alarm goes off put the battery in yourself!",Neutral
"We stayed here for 4 nights in October and we booked a double queen room for three of us all adults. The room was huge and clean. I had requested an upstairs room because of reading earlier comments about noise from above in the lower rooms and we were given an upstairs room at the back of the Hotel.It was quiet and we had no issues with noise from the pool area which was just below us. There is no lift in the Hotel but I was prepared for this and knew I would need to carry may cases up the stairs.The provided breakfast was basic but very adequate, waffles, cereal, toast, eggs, juices, tea and coffee.The hotel is a little older than the ones around it and that is obvious when you arrive but we had no issues with cleanliness and I was not looking for 5 star just a good restful place to sleep.The location for the price was perfect, I would stay here again, no questions asked just for the location and price. The office staff were helpful and friendly, the manager even gave me some milk for a cuppa one night.We were here to see Disneyland not be in motel room so the only time we were were in our room was to sleep and this was a perfect place at a great price to do that.",Good
"We stayed one night in a sun deck room. I enjoyed having my room open up onto the (shared) rooftop sundeck, which was pretty and provided an escape from what I perceived to be quite a strong damp, musty smell in the room itself. The rest of my family could smell it, but didn't find it as unpleasantly strong as I did. The room appeared clean, but the smell resulted in me feeling like the cleanliness might not be what I had hoped for (though I admit I am picky when it comes to cleanliness in hotels). It's probably just due to this being an older building I didn't see any mildew or mold, but the smell was a mildew type smell. We did not use the included continental breakfast....the lady that attends it wants everything done just so...my spouse went down for a cup of coffee in the morning and was not allowed to get their own and was sort of chastised for not realizing that everything needs to go through the breakfast attendant before you partake. We went elsewhere for breakfast. As for positives, the lady at the reception desk in the morning and the gentleman who held our luggage and called our cab were terrific. They were both very pleasant and professional and they made a great impression for the hotel. I wish I had made note of their names so I could mention them specifically. The location was also very convenient and we had easy access to attractions in both the French Quarter and the warehouse district.Thank you for the review. We appreciate all of your feedback and have passed along your comments to our management team for review. Hope to see you again!",Neutral
"When pricing hotels, don't forget about the 50/night parking fee and the resort fee for this hotel. These will add about 75 per night to the listed price. Nice hotel and great location. However, if you don't care about modern furniture and a shot of saki between 5-7pm, then you can find cheaper hotels in the area of the same quality, such as the Mosser, through various travel websites. Thank you for taking the time to share your stay with us. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our location and hotel. We apologize if you were unaware of the expensive parking rates in SF. Our valet is operated by Pro Park America and though the charge seems high, they are competitive with the surrounding hotels pricing in our area. We value your comments and hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again soon!",Good
"Very nice Hotel. We needed 2 rooms for my wife, daughters and I. Mark did a GREAT job helping assist us checking in. The our daughters had fun at the pool and whirlpool will my wife and I relaxed and had a few cocktails at The Bistro. Conrad in The Bistro was awesome as well. We would stay here again.",Good
"The staff at Hampton Inn was helpful and expedient! What a refreshing change from my typical travel experience. I do a lot of business travel and felt well taken care of at this San Diego Hampton Inn. For me, a quick check-in after traveling is very important and the staff was quick and sharp.",Good
"The hotel is in a good area and I felt comfortable going in and out. The only negative on this trip was the lady at the front desk. I checked in about 10AM and had no reservations. She as very short with me and only stated what was necessary, she spoke very fast, did not make any eye contact and continued talking even when she turned away. I felt like I was inconveniencing her. I expected much more friendliness and hospitality from the front desk.I also tried to reserve a shuttle to the airport for the next morning, but she told me she did not have the papers to make the reservation and I should just do it the next morning. I did about 715, but was then told by the morning front desk crew that the shuttle was already booked until 1130.Breakfast buffet is good. Food and staff was not ready at start time, but were very friendly.Ensure you book hotel shuttle as early as you can.",Neutral
"I had a fantastic four days and three nights at the Mandarin Oriental, Miami while in town for a Business Conference. The room, the staff, and the food were top notch. Beach party was excellent.

"Really one of the nicer inns around. Nice interior design, friendly staff, good breakfast.Affordable for families - we are a family of four, and as opposed to many hotels, there is actually enough space for us and the luggage :).Special kudos to Gina who helped us get the day started.",Good
"This hotel had all you need for a comfortable stay before a heavy traveling day. Beds were comfortable, roomy rooms and a nice pool facility. The breakfast was one of the better ones we experienced on our holiday. We had no problem securing a late checkout and shuttle to the airport was an important, good extra. Thanks to all the staff for their friendliness and kindness.Thanks for staying with us. We appreciate your feedback!",Good
"Pros- Very good location- Newly renovated- Clean rooms and fully equiped baths- Comfortable for business trips- Good internet connectionCons- The smell, I noticed it in many hotels similar to this one (but you get used to it)- If you get a room with the view to the street, it is very noisy (the windows are very old)- You cannot pay online, and if your company pays for you, make sure all the papers are signed in advance- The furniture and the beds are old",Neutral
Typical quality you'd expect from a Courtyard with above average lounge and pool spaces staffed by an outstanding group of very warm and helpful employees across the board. Our kids have food allergies so the manage was willing to bend the rules which prohibit outside food.,Good
"I'm a gold Starwood member and membership definitely has its perks. One place where you can definitely take advantage of great opportunities is the St. Regis in San Francisco. I've never had a less than stellar experience here. Stay in an Executive Premier guest room. Terrific value, space, design and comfort. Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay, from wake up service to the little touches, they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes, please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight. I'm never disappointed. Ever. If you have the chance and the budget, do yourself a favor and stay at this truly world-class hotel.",Good
"I have stayed here a couple weeks and am very impressed with place. The reception area is nice and they have on-site, underground parking (), but given the crummy Seattle weather, that works real nice. Rooms are excellent and, if you stay on the lake side, you get nice views. Typical Marriott quality. Breakfast is really excellent. Evening receptions are also very nice. Really, no downsides except the expensive parking, but if you are a biz traveller, no Biggy. I plan on staying here for a good long time.",Good
"I have just enjoyed 4 nights in this lovely hotel on a business trip to San Francisco. The hotel was enthusiastically recommended by work colleagues and I can understand why. It is a relatively small hotel with a lovely personal feeling. The decor is very much to my taste with some great Art Deco references. My room was very spacious with an extremely comfortable bed with lovely linen and great pillows (so important!). There was a good sized walk in shower and the shower had good power to it. There was a good sized desk for me to work at and the Wi-Fi was excellent. From the moment I arrived tired and hungry from the UK every member of staff was excellent. Warm, professional and efficient. As a woman travelling alone, the reception received is extremely important in making one feel comfortable and confident in a strange environment. There is a comfortable small reception area where you can sit and enjoy a morning cup of tea/coffee and complementary wine is served on Wednesday evenings. Sadly I didn't get to sample the bar, restaurant or urban garden. I will definitely be booking again for my next business trip and hope to sample the facilities I didn't have chance to on this visit. Thank you Galleria Park for ensuring my very first visit to SF was so enjoyable.",Good
"Stayed at the JW Marriott Buckhead for two nights while attending a convention in Atlanta. Buckhead really isn't that convenient for downtown Atlanta, although the area is safer and prettier. This hotel is convenient for shopping malls and the MARTA train, but that's about all. The hotel is well maintained and the staff are polite. The rooms are quiet and have pleasant views on higher floors. However, next time I will stay closer to Atlanta itself.",Neutral

"We are from New Orleans and decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary by staying in the French Quarter and having dinner at Galatoire's. We choose the Bienville House because of its location and the reviews on TripAdvisor. The hotel lived up to its reputation - excellent. Very welcoming staff - large, well appointed room with antique looking (maybe the real thing) furniture - terry cloth robes. This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere - New York, Chicago, Dallas - anywhere. And, all for a very reasonable price - a great value.We are so glad you had a wonderful wedding anniversary stay with us at Bienville House! It sounds like you had a great trip. Please come again soon for another great stay!",Good

We enjoyed our stay at the Seattle Hyatt. Helpful staff and a great location close to shopping. Sign up for their rewards program - at no cost - and get free Wi-Fi and other freebies. We were upgraded to a corner suite for only 12.00 additional per night. Suite was very nice and we appreciated the extra room.,Good
"My husband and I drove into SDiego after a 7 1/2 hour drive. (Avoid Hwy 5 if you're coming in from up north. Tons of roadwork). Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card. So I stayed here to earn points. But, note to self: won't be staying here for an extended stay. Can't say I'd recommend it to others.",Neutral

"Despite booking the room type that you think you are getting online, you may find out that the room looks nothing like what you see in the pictures and what is described. The hotel is newer, in a great location and parking is more affordable than most hotels. If the room type is something that you look for in booking a hotel, then my suggestion is go in with low expectations. Hello!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. While we have a number of different room configurations, all of the photographs on our website are taken here at the hotel and are of the specific room types they advertise.

"This hotel was lovely , super clean with amazing rooms. Sea view rooms are to die for. The downside not of this hotel, but the area is that there are so many tramps in the area. Being situated right on the sea front the tramps congregate round the public toilets which are right outside the hotel. They do not hassle anyone though which is ok. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego due to the weather ( as a local told us) , it was a bit of a shock to see so wish I'd been informed b4 we went there , hens I thought I'd put it on here. If you are in this area , please make use of the Bike Ride that you can do around the area , a great way to see the area. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay, your room, and the ocean views!

"When I called into the customer service number to initially make my reservation for my stay, I was quoted a price of 134USD plus taxes. I repeatedly asked the customer service rep the price and he repeatedly answered 134USD plus tax. However, when I arrived at the hotel two days later I was charged 149USD plus tax. I have called customer service 4 times to explain my situation and to get an understanding of why I was overcharged at the hotel, however, I am to this day unable to find a manager at the call center to solve my discrepancy. I explained my situation at the hotel yet they refused to listen and explained that I would have to call customer service. On top of all this, I asked if I would be able to do a late checkout at 2 pm and the front desk attendant responded that I would have to be charged an extra 25 dollars. I was given a king suite and it had a shared door with another room. There was noise coming from the next room though out the night, and it was as if the other people were in the same room as me.My experience definitely did not live up to the Hilton standards that I once knew. Nor my standards for that matter.Hi Roving,Thank you for sharing your experience, I have revised your reservation and it appears that it was booked as a breakfast package. In this case, the rate goes up by every occupant in the room and it appears it was changed from one guest to two guests.

"The room was adequate but the breakfast was terrible. First the space is under construction. There is no room to sit. They did not keep the food stocked.

"My daughter won a charity silent auction for 2 nights at the Ocean Park Inn, and she gave it to me as a Christmas present. The guy at the counter was very personable, and check-in went smoothly. Parking is underground with elevators that took us to the 3rd floor. The room was modern, immaculate, and had a great view of the boardwalk and ocean. The included breakfast was good, especially the waffles. I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff....lobby, maids, breakfast assistant etc. The location is certainly the best in the Ocean Beach area. Great restaurants along the beach. If you have the , this is the place to stay.Thank you for the awesome feedback, and for participating in the charity event! We are glad you were able to come spend some time with us in Pacific Beach.

"Stayed for a weekend with my family in one of the hotel's park suites. Firstly the good bits - good amount of space for a San Fran hotel. Very well located for walking to both Union Square and the Embarcadero and most other attractions. Bed was comfortable, the staff were helpful and the fittings and fixture are, for the most part, in good condition and visually appealing and the room was well cleaned. Son was able to have a sofa bed in the lounge room which was useful. We took our own luggage up to the room - personally prefer this as the US tipping culture drives me a little bonkers and I know how to operate a TV and what a shower looks like!The disadvantages are primarily the noise. If you have a room with walls to the street, bring ear plugs - it isn't well sound proofed and after 3 nights we were longing for a decent night's sleep. Some of the furniture looks like it was there from some previous iteration of the hotel - our TV cabinet/chest of drawers looked out of place and somewhat tatty against more modern furnishings. There is no breakfast so you will have to go and find something - not that that's a big deal in San Francisco. They could also do with turning the aircon down in the main hall - it was a little arctic at times!Would we stay there again Probably not as the noise was a bit too much which is a shame as other than that it's a perfectly decent hotel.Dear SwissNomad1,We really appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us. Good or bad we are always open to hearing back from our guests. This allows us to find areas in which we can improve our customer's experience in our property.

"We stayed here March 8-10, 2013. Check-in was breeze. Very friendly staff. The room was better than I expected it to be.

"First, some things that us question our choice: We arrived for a long stay around 10pm on a Friday and the lobby main door was locked... we had to use a bullet proof night window to check in (like a bank would have in a not so nice part of town). After feigning hearing issues with her behind glass, I asked to be let in the lobby and was let in and saw security camera monitors were pointed at every possible corner of the grounds. We got a room on the 3rd floor and the automatic door facing the hall to the rooms was broken. We had to walk all the way around the outside. We get to the elevator and its down for maintenance. I went back into the lobby and asked for a first floor room or second floor at least and she gave us one. When we got in the room though we were pleasantly surprised. The room looked updated for the most part with a nice granite counter outside the bathroom, counter height refrigerator and microwave. Horrible outdated tv though and ours had a loud screeching sound until it got warmed up. Bathroom was unbearably small. You had to step in and go behind the toilet to close the door. Outlets were lacking too. My husband and I both use our cell phones as alarms and want to plug in our phones next to the bed but there were not outlets anywhere near it. I had to unplug a lamp on the other side of the room. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast was blah but I wasn't expecting much from continental. Lo and behold, something else was broken! There are two Belgian waffle makers and one was out of order so we waited a very long time for our turn. Cereal, pastries, toast, coffee, etc. Every piece of fruit I got was a little past prime. Nothing to rave about.Overall, for the money, great deal and adequate for short hotel stay.",Neutral

"I'd always stayed in downtown when I visited Seattle, but decided to try something different this time, which led me to The Sorrento. I couldn't be happier about my choice. The First Hill location is quiet, mostly residential plus a couple hospitals. It's sort of between Capitol Hill and downtown, which are my favorite neighborhoods and within walking distance. Immediately near the hotel, there are Starbucks, Top Pot Donuts, McDonald, Walgreens (I think) and Bank of America - all that convenience! The hotel itself is full of old world charm w/o feeling stuffy or dated. Its restaurant Dunbar Room was excellent - the ambience and hospitality actually reminded me of New Orleans. I stayed at the junior suite - it's big and has a lot of nice details from a design standpoint. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, which made my stay even more wonderful. My only frustration was weak, spotty WiFi - it could just be that particular weekend but I'd keep in mind if you travel for business and WiFi is crucial.Any comparison to the Big Easy I'll take!

"Okay, here's the scoop: Yes, the rooms are small, yes, the rooms (many of them) not only have no view, but actually overlook a brick wall(this is NOT charming, as it would be in say, New York, or perhaps London - it is dark and annoying). However, to balance that out, the staff is very interested in doing what they can for you, and even more interesting (and appealing) is that they don't get defensive or bristle when doing so.As another reviewer said, if you can score a corner room, you will have more space - as the standard rooms are diminutive by any definition. Again, on the bright side, while not actually IN the French Quarter, the hotel is one block west of Canal, and Carondelet St. (the street the hotel is on) turns into Bourbon St after crossing Canal ... so can't get much closer. There is a Walgreen's two blocks away, and The Riverwalk Mall is only about six blocks ...near Harrah's casino. Cloud: Valet parking costs nearly 27 a night. Silver lining: The valet is friendly, helpful and seems to be expedient. The only other thing that might affect our decision to return (and this is not the fault of the hotel) is that the sidewalks are closed on alternating sides so that you MUST cross the street in the middle of the block to walk down to the French Quarter. In other words, as you turn right out of the hotel, the sidewalk is closed on the right hand side, so you walk on the left hand side, then a block down, it is closed on the left, so you must again cross mid-block to walk on the right. We had a toddler in a stroller with us, and that made getting to and from a bit of a challenge (there are street car tracks down the middle of the street - making a stroller a bit cumbersome).",Neutral
"So my boyfriend and his friend had just moved out and had to stay at a hotel for a week before moving into to their new place. This place is moderately cheap, but there is great reasoning for that. This place is absolutely disgusting, the pool was green and not taken care of, the elevator was sketchy, it's located right off the freeway, (so don't expect a quiet nights sleep)w and the rooms smelled like death. But that wasn't even the worst part, it was the Indian managers customer service and attitude. I live in Seattle, and out of the week my boyfriend was staying there I slept over two times. The second time, it was the last day of his stay, and I was downstairs getting us breakfast (which was STALE mini bagels, and little muffins which were not that great) and the Indian manager was watching me the whole time. When I was heading back up he approached me and asked my room number, I told him and he stated only two people were checked into that room. I said my boyfriend is one of them and I've only stayed two nights and he went off how I was lying and he was going to charge them an extra 30 dollars a NIGHT. I went back up to the room and my boyfriend was still sleeping and he called our room and started yelling at him over the phone, so he went downstairs to talk it out with him. Eventually after being harassed several times the Indian man gave up. Once it was check out at 10 am, he came to our door and stood there yelling at us until we were out. Worst service I've ever had in my entire life, DO NOT GO HERE.

My son just graduated from UCSD and I wish I had discovered this beautiful hotel earlier in his student days.

"I was here for 5 nights during a trade show. Location is great. Hotel is completely charming, and beautiful. Staff goes out of their way for you. I had room 447 which was huge with 2 queen beds and a view of the parking lot across Decatur where the Natchez departs from. I requested a mini fridge and it was delivered minutes after my arrival. My complains were addressed when I let the front desk know... There was a build up of dust above the beds and a moldy matte border around the lower print on the wall near the armoire.My only suggestions for improvement would be to have a small fridge in each room and add a shaving/makeup mirror to the bathroom sink area.

We also noticed our hair dryer holder from the wall was coming off. Breakfast menu is ok. Hot food changes every other day: scrambled eggs gravy with biscuits, scrambled eggs sausages. Lots of variety but after our third day...nah. Walking distance to International Drive, close to lots of gift shops and restaurants.

"We stayed there Summer 2010 but thought we should put a review in on the hotel. Room is rated as average because of price. This is a no frills hotel.I will admit when I first arrived at the Del Sol Inn, I was not impressed and thought oh my gosh this is an old run down motel. We stayed there four nights and the place grew on us. For the price it is a true bargain. It is so close and so reasonable. The beds are nothing to brag about and the breakfast hours make it difficult if you plan on making an early morning entry. But what they lack on upgrades they make up on service. I asked for a few more pillows on our first night and their response was how many would you like. We had breakfast in our room one morning (because we were up earlier than the provided breakfast time) I went by the office for some sugar. He could not find, the sugar packets so he provided me with a bowl of sugar. The housekeeping actually did a fantastic job. We caught them twice (we come back for naps and lunch) and there were THREE housekeepers cleaning our room. Lets face it the room is VERY INEXPENSIVE for the location the location can not be any better unless you were staying next door for twice (or more) the price. Like I said when I first arrived I was disappointed but after four days of being so close and getting pretty decent service, they won me over. This place is a real bargain. Oh and parking lot is small we never had a problem and we would drive off for lunch and them come back and take that nap I mentioned. Just realize you are paying for the location and you will not be disappointed. They could upgrade the beds, extend the breakfast hours, etc ... but if they did that they may have to charge more.",Good
"Great location, clean and large sized room. We forgot a ten year old bottle of wine in a drawer along with a blood pressure monitor upon checking out. When we remembered the next day that we had forgotten the items, we returned in hopes of recovering our items. Unfortunately the unit was re-rented and the guests were not in their room. So we figured we were out both our wine as well as our blood pressure unit.To our surprise some days later the front desk girl (a very kind young lady named Darby) contacted us and said she had both our forgotten pieces.

"Here's the good:1) Location - right on Michigan Ave -- walk to Millennium Park, walk to the theatre for Hamilton, walk the Magnificent Mile.2) Big suite. We stayed in 2304 -- 23rd floor -- very roomy. I think our room used to be an apartment. Maybe this whole hotel was once either apartments or condos. Our suite has a full kitchen (small oven, small fridge/freezer) and living room, and then there was a separate bedroom. Bonus: an apartment-size stackable washer and dryer right in the bedroom closet! We had been on vacation for a week already, so we were thrilled to be able to do some laundry. The bad/annoying:1) It's older and it shows. The bathroom in our unit looks like the bathroom of your friend's house that hasn't been remodeled in a while. Especially the tub with the semi-nasty non-slip stuff on the bathtub floor. The corners of the bathroom were dirty, with caulk that had seen better days. 2) The counter area around the bathroom sink is very small -- picky, I know, but sometimes we women need space to put out all our stuff!3) There are only two elevators to serve 25 (26) floors. One is very small, and they are both always busy.4) Although a typical Comfort Suites breakfast, for the kind of the money we paid for this room, I'd like to see them up their game a little.5) It's kind of nice to be able to have ice in your room for beverages. Even though there was a fridge/freezer in our room, there were no automatic ice maker or even good old-fashioned ice trays in the room. For the entire hotel, there was only one ice machine. It was on the first floor (23 floors down on a slow elevator), in the breakfast room, and it was the kind intended to fill just your glass. Naturally, it was out of ice a couple of different times during the few days we were there. If you want to stay at this hotel, throw a couple of plastic ice trays (if you still own some!) into your suitcase. You'll thank me later! Something to know:Parking is across the street and 1/2 a block south. 40/night and that's getting your parking ticket validated -- otherwise it's 49/night. Also, you don't just pay the way you normally do when you leave a parking garage -- a machine or an attendant. You have to walk up to the parking garage office (in an office building) and pay there. It's not so bad, you just have to know the system and allow extra time.Dear Marie J,Thank you for your recent review. The hotel was a converted apartment building. We offer the largest suites on Michigan Avenue. All with full kitchens and washer and dryers. Our location is within walking distance to all of the area attractions. Each year we update an area within the hotel. We recently replaced all of our sofas in our rooms. Remodeled our lobby and common areas. Self parking is a little difficult to get your discount. We don't own the garage only get the reduced rate for you. However the trade off is paying over 60 per night at the another area hotel. So you do save a little money with our program.We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",Neutral
"Nice little hotel full of character, in a great location - ideal for exploring Fisherman's Wharf.Despite the shared bathroom facilities I never had to queue, however did worry about taking too long in the shower! Room was a bit of a squeeze, with limited privacy as our two windows were internal. Free tea/coffee/chilled water available for free. Two cable car turn-arounds close by so well connected to Downtown and Union square. Ghirardelli Square in walking distance and plenty bars located around about.

"Pros: can't say enough about the location. walking distance to restaurants, convenience stores and pharmacy. Minutes like 5 minutes top to universal. 6 minutes to the giant ferris wheel. Stayed here before and can say they have started some renovations that were much needed. Check in was easy and check out as well. Water pressure was amazing. If you are here for the parks and not be in the hotel much it would be perfect match. Cons: rooms are not noise proof. TV was out dated. more repairs are needed. It's improved but needs more done. The motel can not help how other guest act but I cold see they were monitoring a couple in a huge fight that everyone could here. I had my phone ready to call 911 if need be. No bar which was a bummer. The in house deli wasn't anything really. I decided to eat breakfast else where after that. With Denny's across the street and ihop in walking distance it was no biggie. I had an inside hallway near the pool it seemed a bit more quiet but felt isolated. If your in need of a budget friendly and aren't picky about things it would be a match. If you have kids its not bad and are on the conscience mind its perfect match. Most kids don't care as long as there is a pool.",Neutral
"It's a nice Best Western hotel with good staff. Rooms are clean and the AC work well. There are a few things that take away a point: the parking is tight even with our family minivan. We got unexpected wake up call from some body car alarm goes off in the middle of the night right outside our room! and one night from the shampoo dispenser in the bath room came off the wall and crashed in the bath tub. It would be nice if they install a room safe and a small refrigerator.Hello FNguyen, Thank you for taking time to review us here on Trip Advisor. We work hard to keep our rooms and property ultra clean and well maintained, our staff consistently offers superior service to all our guests. Thank you for recognizing our efforts! We appreciate your honest remarks. We are so sorry you had a few odd incidents during your stay. Unfortunately, there are some things that we cannot control. Our parking lot can get a little tight, especially during sold out nights. Many guests with larger vehicles choose to park on the street for that reason. The area that we are in is generally a safe business/residential area and fortunately, we have not had any negative reports from people who have chosen to park on the street. We do warn guests that early Tuesday mornings, street sweeping takes place and tickets are given to anyone parked during those hours. As far as the shampoo dispensers go, we have found a solution to this problem and are currently taking care of it so that it does not continue to be an issue. Your two suggestions have been passed on to the GM for consideration. We value our guests input and are always working on improving our little hotel.

"Stayed 3 nights in a 2 room suite (we were a party of 3 adults). The location was very convenient. The French Quarter was a short walk and the area was very safe. Close to the trolley and the WWII Museum. The suite was large, but the bedroom had no window and the window in the other room had no view. The sofa bed did not pull out easily, so my son just slept on the sofa which he was ok with. It was nice having the extra space privacy with 2 rooms and the price was right. The complimentary breakfast was nice. We didn't make much use of the evening social hour because who wants to eat hot dogs chips when there is such great food in New Orleans, but if you are a family economizing you could easily make a meal out of it. It looked like the hotel does a lot of tour business.",Good
"Traveled to Atlanta for family reunion. I've stayed at a Renaissance before, but not in the Atlanta area. I'm a Marriott Rewards member, so I try to stay within the Marriott family. I found hotel on Expedia.com and the reviews were decent.When we arrived, it was around 9 pm. The concierge was not present outside, so we proceeded to checkin at the front desk. The front desk clerk was ok, but did not have the bubbly personality that I am familiar with during a late checkin. Each time I went to front desk for information, the same personality was observed on different clerks. We were placed in room 624. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very spacious. The hotel is VERY large and has a center indoor courtyard. There are about 3-4 elevators for entire hotel. They were not slow, but often crowded.We stayed 3 nights and each night the parking was very difficult. There was a beauty pageant taking place during the same weekend, so parking was horrible. We found a spot each night, but it often took 3 times going around the parking lot before we found one that was a 2 minute walk from the hotel. I felt safe each time walking from the parking lot to the hotel. The pool area was very crowded, even an hour before it closed. They have two pools, one indoor and one outdoor. The indoor pool is a salt water pool. Overall, I would definitely stay here again and hopefully not during a beauty pageant event.Thank you for the detailed feedback on your recent visit.

"Went to Broken Shaker on the tip from a friend and so glad we did. The bar is almost hidden in the back of the Freehand Hotel/Hostel in Chicago. It is small and intimate and warm and inviting. There is so much to see in this small bar from the Hand Painted Octopus mural on the wall (and hidden on the 70's wallpaper) to the macram wall hangings. It definitely feels like you are in your parent's basement in the 70's - but cooler. The cocktails are delicious. We had the B*tch Don't Kill my Vibe and the margarita with chorizo salt. Another friend got their famous Cocoa Puff Old Fashioned. All were delicious. We didn't eat at the Broken Shaker on this visit, but saw some food being brought out and it all looked wonderful. We will definitely be back!Hi Casa1234, Thanks for visiting us and I am so glad to hear you LOVED the Broken Shaker.

Although the pool was small, it still had about 10 people in the pool when we checked in and they were really loud. When we got into the room, however, we couldn't hear them at all. The rooms are a bit on the small side, and the lighting kind of sucks unless you have the drapes open (but can't have those open when getting ready).

Avrelia greeted us every morning with a smile and did a great job with breakfast which was terrific, then there was Jose the maintence man who went out of his way when the TV would not work. you should be proud of your lovely hotel and the people who work for the hotel,thanks Hank and Michelle you both made Mary and I feel at home looking forward to seeing everyone in January.

"This was more than we expected for the weekend! Comfortable bed, clean and quiet room with friendly, attentive staff. Yes, it's not perfect...could be closer to places for eats and drinks, the TV in the master bedroom was ancient and small but we weren't in Dallas to watch television! Perfect location in proximity to Fair Park..will definitely stay again.",Good
"We had an amazing road trip, after getting married in Las Vegas, ending in San Francisco. This hotel however was the biggest disappointment of our trip. We had booked the Hilton, but then found this at half the cost decided to book it so we could spend our money on other things. We wished we'd stuck with the Hilton. I'm not normally one for writing a bad review (in fact it's my 1st I feel like I'm being mean!) it wasn't really that bad, it just wasn't the best one on our trip. We'd booked a cheaper one in Morro Bay, (we wanted to experience a Motel) which knocked the socks of this hotel for both room service!Before we arrived we had emailed the hotel to let them know we had just got married, to ask if they had any upgrades. They kindly offered us 2 options: a free upgrade to a garden view or a paid one into a front facing harbour view. We said yes to the paid one, as it was our honeymoon after all. When we arrived at the hotel, the guy on reception had no details about it at all. When we asked about it he said we would have to speak to the manager in the morning and see if there were any free the next day. We were disappointed to say the least, especially as we had the email with the confirmation. We didn't bother speaking to the manager the next day, we were only there for 2 nights didn't want to spend the time moaning:) So we just took the room they had. It was ok. We found out it was the garden view (overlooking 3 palm trees:)). It was clean did the job. Breakfast was not great. Greasy food most of it looked unhygienic. So I didn't bother. My husband ate the bagels. Before we went out for the day I asked reception about a group of seals we had heard about by the harbour where we were likely to find them. He basically laughed at me and said 'you'll just hear them, they are everywhere'. Thought it was a bit rude. As it turns out we saw hundreds all the way up highway 1, quite an experience for us coming from the UK. If you just want a cheaper option for a pit stop, it will do the job. It was clean after all. If you want somewhere nicer, book the Hilton.",Bad
"The Conrad Chicago was One of the Best Hotels I have ever stayed at! I travel often for business and was blown away from walking into the Conrad, with the Lobby on the 20th floor to the Rooftop Bar.

"Upon check-in, greeted by wonderful front desk (think her name was Erika). She was so thorough, considerate - walked us through neighborhood map along with restaurant recommendations. Seeing that we were saying for a week, she gave was able to accommodate us by giving a room on the higher floors - 9th floor (which we thought was great attention to service). Was quite thirsty having just arrived, it was great to turn around to see there was free lemon water offered in the lobby! Really nice touch! We also found out later they offer complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings (in the lobby) too!Room met expectation - walked in and was quite pleased. Lovely room decor, nice designer lamps. Although we didn't use it, definitely a beautifully supplied fridge full of soft drinks/water and a nice minibar selection of drinks and snacks. Wifi access was really good! Compared to other hotels I've stayed at, Solamar's internet connection was pretty fast - therefore, more time to relax (instead of just sitting in front of the laptop waiting for page to be loaded). Size of tv was nice and larger than we normally are used to. Also, the remote control itself was CLEAN (meaning, no gunk stuck on it or anything of that sort).Bed itself was slightly on the hard side, though, by the time we finished our day, we were too tired and didn't mind that too much. Good thing was that the pillows were quite nice and soft. Bathroom: it was cool to have it as a sliding door (note: no lock). Amenities - good supply. Shampoo, shower and conditioner is not the mini-sized bottles, rather bottles which are mounted to the tub wall, so well lasts for days ahead. Good counter space where you can spread out all your things. The only thing to really say is about the sink itself. The sink has great visual appeal, though functionally, doesn't work too well, splatter water all over the counter because the sink sits on top of the counter rather than being curved down (if that makes any sense). So, always had to wipe down the counter each time after use.In all, clean modern hotel, which I definitely would be a place to return to for my next San Diego visit!Thank you for the great, and very thorough, review. I'm thrilled that Erika made such a good impression upon your arrival, she is very friendly and fun to talk to. Thank you for your stay with us and I'm glad we had a positive impact on your vacation. Hope to see you again.",Good
"This has been my second stay at the Downtown Orlando Marriott Courtyard and everyone who works there is always so very friendly and nice. If you need something and call the font desk they make sure you get it immediately. Also because this hotel is away from the tourist area and full of business people, you are assured a nice quite nights sleep. I really recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to Orlando. The only downside to the Downtown Courtyard would be the iron. They really not good, but that shouldn't deter you from staying here.",Good

"My wife and I spent lots of time searching for hotels in San Francisco - we were travelling to the city for our 10th wedding anniversay, so we wanted something special. We were really worried by some of the reviews of other hotels (too noisy, poor location, bad smells, poor service, etc.). By chance, we happened upon a review of the Orchard Garden Hotel. It looked good via the website and our initial contact with staff on the booking line was positive. So we took a chance. It helped that the hotel promoted its eco-credentials.When we got there, we were really pleased with our choice. Just steps away from the China Town gate, a few minutes from Union Square and about 10 minutes walk from the nearest BART station - so plenty of bustle if we wanted. However, the road the hotel is on is a relatively quiet one and this is helped by really good double-glazing (as you might expect from an eco-hotel). To be fair, we were staying on the 9th floor. But the room ventilation was quiet and there were no other noises to disturb our sleep - beds are really comfortable, too.The rooms are very nice with a good, clean and light decor. Nicely appointed, too. We ate in the restaurant the first night - the food is very good but, as you might expect from a hotel in SF, quite expensive. We knew it would be and it didn't detract from the experience. We ate breakfast at one of the many cafes in the area - once again, this hotel is in a good location.The staff are friendly and genuinely welcoming with good local knowledge. There is even a little room with a couple of PCs and a printer for Internet access.In conclusion, we are really happy with our choice of hotel and will defintely make this our hotel of choice for our next trip to SF. I thoroughly recommend the Orchard Garden.",Good
"Stayed here recently to celebrate my anniversary. The location is good, all the restaurants and bars are within walking distance. The hotel itself was nice but me and my boyfriend felt a little out of place. We are 25 and were definitely some of the youngest people there. I chose this hotel because there was a balcony option and the view was nice. Valet could use some work, seems like they are understaffed in that department and its also pretty expensive (42 a day). All in all I enjoyed my stay but will consider other places next time Im in SD. Maybe something more age appropriate and lively.",Neutral
"I made this reservation only because the Hilton around the corner, was booked for the weekend. Hampton Inn's normally being consistently clean and consistent, I decided to make the reservation. The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, all shifts, while there. The room was small, noisy. The television never worked the entire stay. We have to call someone from the hotel, every time we wanted to turn it on! Some issue with the cable or buttons in the back, it was nothing but fuzz. When they would come to fix it they would say I think that's got it and then we would have to call again. There was a piece of debris on the tile floor in the entry way, never got cleaned up the entire stay. How do you not see a piece of dark colored debris on a light color tile floorThe hot water and pressure in the shower was an issue, just as I have seen others report on this site. Took forever to get hot water, no matter whether AM or PM. Pressure very low. This was a leisure trip and regardless, it would be nice to have all of the necessities you pay for when away from home.Dear Janice E,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel.

"Had a great time at the St. James Hotel. Stayed in room 403. Arrived 5/3/15 in the afternoon and both Ingrid and Jon were so helpful, although our room wasn't ready when we checked in (checked in at noon - room ready at 3 which is normal), Ingrid and Jon got us signed up for some tours, told us where to go to get a good drink for the price (Fais Deaux Deaux's fishbowls - crazy but great), and made sure we felt comfortable.We didn't eat the hotel breakfast as the Ruby Slipper is right down the street and Mothers is right around the corner (like the Ruby Slipper more). Every time we entered the hotel we were greeted, the staff asked us how our day went and gave us great tips on where to go to catch some great jazz and good deals. Everyone was super nice.The room - was vintage and not your typical square room (under the eaves - it was great actually), we had a balcony with table to sit and enjoy the evening with a bottle of wine (corkscrew supplied by front desk - thank you). The hotel is within walking distance of everything (and I do mean everything). Bring good shoes to walk in because you will get your exercise in this city - but being close to everything also meant we didn't have far to stumble if we drank too much, could drop things off at the hotel if we bought too much and could return for naps in between outings.",Good
"Stayed here for a week (Sat. to Sat.) while visiting San Diego. The hotel was clean and free breakfast was great. The hotel seemed to be newer as evident by the modern decor.For those traveling with small children, our room only had a shower. Our 2 yr. old has only taken baths so he had to quickly get used to a shower, which did not end up being too bad for us. Location is excellent as you are 10 minutes from Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, USS Midway and much more. Parking is usually 16 a night but when we checked in they gave it to us for 10 a night! We rented a Hyundai Elantra and anything bigger would have been a pain to park as spaces seem very tight. This was not only at the hotel, but pretty much anywhere we parked in San Diego.",Good

"This hotel has the potential to be very good but is let down by an overall tired level of decor in most of the rooms. A wet bathroom floor from a persistently dripping toilet, doors that did not shut properly, odd holes and dents in doors and walls, stained carpets and so on. If you an overseas traveller and really need wi-fi then I'd suggest you go somewhere else. In a 3 week USA vacation this was the worst wi-fi ever. If you could get a signal then it would frequently drop out. The front desk was not at all sympathetic and frankly turned us off this place altogether - a real shame as it has potential.

"The Moxy paints itself as a hip hotel. It's about as hip as morning radio DJs. It tries way to hard to be loose, fun, and alternative, and it misses the mark. You have to check in at a bar. They give you a free drink upon check-in. The focus here seems to be alcoholfun. Unfortunately some of us don't drink. Since the poker chip they give you immediately is cashed in for a rum concoction before you even get the chance to say anything I wouldn't recommend this place for those striving to be sober. I was disappointed by the lack of choice. (Shrug)The rooms are small, but well arranged, and have a great view outside. Unfortunately the hotels hip theme continues into the room, where just like morning radio stations, they try to create a faux funky culture with band name stickers on the door. Fans of Aerosmith, Kiss, Greenday and Red Hot Chili Peppers will enjoy, everyone else who has taste will find it annoying and a desperate attempt to be cool. The bunk beds are a great idea, but not recommended for anyone over 5'6 because their feet will hang off the end of the mattress. I would not recommend the room for people who are sharing who don't want to see each other's silhouettes in the shower since the doors are frosted but see through. The bunk bed room would be a good place for a small family or a couple of close friends. The main lobby of the hotel at night is a busy bar scene. Expect drunks, rude bouncers, and a DJ spinning dance music. The taco bar is open, but expensive. 3+ for a small bottle of water. I would recommend this place for 2 Millennial besties (at least one needs to be a proud owner of a fedora), it's in a good spot, it's a party scene, and people in their 20s don't have the same expectations as the rest of us.Noxiousburrito,Thanks for giving the Moxy Chicago a go!

"We got a great deal on the hotel which included breakfast and a cocktail (we never got to the cocktail as we were always outside of the hotel during dinner time). The hotel was very clean and the service was great. Even though the hotel was full, you never felt it inside. The breakfast was never good, however a little repetitive with no real major choice changes throughout our stay. If they added a few extra items and had different choices for breakfast during the week would put this hotel over the top. However, I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to staying at a Disney (on-site) hotel.",Good

"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights because of the close proximity to Moscone Center, the art museum and great shopping, and of course because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. (How did we ever travel before Trip Advisor) Loved our time here. We requested and were given a quiet room - on the 17th floor. Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use (15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant. The lap pool was warm and beautiful and empty - unfortunately I forgot my suit. Too bad the spa didn't have a basic suit to sell, like they do in some hotels. I would happily stay here again. By the way, San Francisco,what's up with the homeless people on your streets I've never seen so much panhandling and yelling and screaming and craziness and was actually afraid in some situations.",Good
"The most redeeming aspect of this hotel is its central location. It is conveniently located to most central SF sights and even has an amazing cafe/bakery next door. The rooms were fairly clean and free internet was fast.Quality/setup of the rooms varied tremendously. We were initially placed into room 810, which is a terrible room (despite the website's claim that king rooms are 300 sq ft). It is extremely small, shaped awkwardly, and has a tiny short stand alone closet that cannot even accommodate a normal men's shirt vertically on a hanger. The worst part, however, was that we had requested a quiet room and found out that the room was connected by a locked door to a neighboring suite. You could hear every whisper, shout, suitcase opening, etc. There was literally no insulation (the worst I've ever seen in a connecting room situation).We were then transferred to a different room with two beds that was a good size and had an actual closet. Both bathrooms were not practically designed with no real space to place anything next to the sink.Overall, would recommend if at a good price but don't hesitate to switch rooms if you get something terrible.Dear vvv3,Thank you very much for taking the time to review us at Galleria Park. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.I must agree that Galleria Park is in a great location, as it is very easy to access via transportation but also near enough to many SF attractions that you can choose to walk. As a hotel that is over 100 years old our rooms do vary, and I would like to sincerely apologize that the first was not to your taste. I am pleased to hear that the second was much better and you were able to enjoy your stay with us.We hope to see you the next time you return to the city.Best,Jordan Whitney",Good

"I stayed in this place for 2 weeks, the staff is peculiarly rude. They don't understand the meaning of hospitality. Given the fact it's an extended stay, still the front desk, housekeeping is expected to be a little polite. On my check out day since my flight was in the afternoon I requested for an hour extension given the fact that their check out timings are 11 am, but, inspite of my requests and over looking the fact that I had already been there for 2 weeks, they rudely turned down the request.

"We were looking for a secluded resort style hotel to relax and enjoy the La Jolla area and were not dissapointed. We (family of 4 adults) did not want to stay at one of the chains and had stayed on Coronado island and the Lodge at Torrey Pines before so we gave Estancia a try and were very satisfied. The staff was nice and very helpful with beautiful landscaping and vegetation, even in the middle of a severe drought. There were 2 walking paths from the hotel with one going to the glider port/beach which was cool watching the para gliders launch and sail along the cliff (both para and hang gliders available for tandem rides) and the other path going through a nice neighborhood to Black's beach which had a fairly steep road at the end which got your heart going on the way back. The girls had no trouble finding chairs at the pool and raved about the Spa's Hanakasumi and Inspire 80 minute massages. I would head to the fitness center in the afternoon while they were out sunning and was the only one in there (although I heard that the mornings usually had a crowd). There are 4 treadmills, 2 bikes, 2 ellipticals with free weights to 45 lbs and 4 machines ie enough for a basic workout. We did the kayaking/snorkeling tour from La Jolla Kayak with the kayaking being the better activity (although having a sea lion swim by while snorkelling in one of the caves was pretty cool). We usually ordered in breakfast which was good with ample portions. The best breakfast though was at The Cottage, a must if you enjoy breakfast. We went the good but casual restaurant route with George's at the Cove terrace and the Brockton Villa (stay inside to avoid sea lion aroma) for good food with a view and Piazza 1909 for a step above the pecan crusted/fish taco fare. All were topped off with gelato from Bobboi's. We were there for 4 nights during the week and all were able to truly unwind and relax. The only nit I had was that the housekeeping staff never understood that we had 4 adults so daily calls for more coffee cups etc was needed but overall, we would definitely stay again.Dear Mathonthego.Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay. We are pleased to hear that you had such a wonderful stay with us and you were able to take advantage of the amenities we offer. It sounds like you were very active during your 4-day stay, and we look forward to welcoming you back again, soon!",Good

"I ended up here unexpectedly. I made my reservation in the care on my way to the airport for an unexpected lay over in Orlando to catch an early morning flight out to Aruba. Rates were reasonable and the booking process on my phone was a breeze. I also used the digital check in and picked my room. The hotel was clean, front desk was welcoming on check in and out. Prompt shuttle pickup and delivery to and from airport. Restaurant was good, staff was friendly and helpful. Beer was cold and the food was better than you might expect in a hotel restaurant. Cookies in lobby are always a bonus as is the flavored water. Trusted brand all the way around.Thank you for being loyal towards our brand and choosing to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport.

"This hotel was very nice with a great location. (providing what you want to do) I love NOLA so even as a solo visitor for one night I booked with SPG as I always do as a platinum member. Upon arrival I was upgraded (sunday night helps with that always) and the room was nice and shower was just fine.I ran into problem with a very slow internet connection and after making every attempt to fix it on my end... after speaking to a colleague I realized it was simply the internet was bad. This made it very difficult and had to walk and send some documents from a coffee shop. All easy fixes in all honesty.Where i was very disappointed was with the cleanliness of my bed. After waking up and checking that all window were shut as it felt if someone was smoking in my face I realized my pillow had not been washed or were just that old that they reeked of smoke and it actually gave me a bit of a soar throat. When i told the staff, i was met with a simple. Sorry, while I appreciate that at 6am I was expecting something a little more above and beyond. So I went on a walk because I couldn't sleep any longer. Very disappointed.",Bad

this is our 4th year staying with them. every year we stay in the northshore (not on the main island). it is perfect if looking for seclusion and to spend time with the family.

We stayed two nights here on our way to Hawaii and we will likely stay here again. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast has lots of variety and good parking for your vehicle.

"Not as close to UCF as I had hoped. The room was fairly large and had 2 queens which I like. Beds were comfy with good pillows. Bathroom was clean. My only complaint would be the carpet - didn't seem very clean and I kept my shoes on. Bathroom floor was clean though. I don't think it's worth 109/night. Annoying guests who stood outside my room and smoked and talked all night. I didn't have the breakfast so I can't comment on that.I am trying to book a place for an upcoming weekend in the UCF area and I guess I'm gonna go with this place again, although I'd rather find someplace else. It seems that near UCF there are only very expensive choices or total dives. This one is in between so I guess I'll book it. Everything else is filling up fast.",Neutral

"We arrived October 26, 2018. We used the hotel's underground parking garage. Bryan, a hotel empolyee who opened the parking garage security gate, assisted us with parking our car by directing my husband into a parking spot. While Bryan, stood behind our car, he directed my husband into backing into a very tight parking space. Bryan continued to direct my husband while he backed into the space until Bryan said you are on the wall! When my husband pulled forward we saw massive areas of paint had been scraped off our car. NOT once did Bryan indicate the car was about to hit the wall. Bryan never apologized. We told Michael,who was working at the front desk, about the incident. But because we had friends waiting on us for dinner we did not fill out an Incident Report at that time. When we returned later that night we spoke to Ruby ( who was working at the front desk) about the incident and she advised us that we needed to talk to Candice Hudson, GM, who would be in the next morning betweem 9-10AM. We were then given a Wyndham Garden Incident Report form. The next morning we went to talk to Ms. Hudson only to be told she would not be in. But we did ask to see the security video tape of the incident which an empolyee showed us. We then asked who could we talk to about an incident report with and we were told Ms. Elysia Smith, manager on duty. When we had the opportunity to speak with Ms. Elysia Smith her immediate response: was since my husband was driving the vehicle then the hotel had no liability even though her empolyee directed my husband into the space. I asked for a copy of the incident report we had completed and was told by Ms. Elysia Smith we could not have one (as copies are prohibited). An empolyee suggested we take a picture of the report and Ms. Smith immediatley chastised him for his suggestion. WE are extremely disappointed the way the accident was handled. If Wynndham wants hard line, no empathy, and rude general managers then Ms. Smith is a perfect fit. As of October 26-27, 2018 there is no signage in the garage to direct traffic to exit. The concrete columns in the garage are huge and straddle two parking spaces. According to Bryan, the coulmns are wrapped to prevent cars from scrapping them--so the hotel must expect all the columns to be hit. Our hotel room was spacious as it was a handicapp accessible room and the beds were comfortable. The interior of the hotel is beautiful and spacious. Good location for walking to Canal Street and the Quarter. But with management's attidude toward us, our visit was not pleasureable and we will not stay there again.Thank you for taking the time to write a review on your most recent stay with us. We apologize if your stay was not 100 satisfactory for we do value your business and strive to ensure every guest experience is positive.

Upon our return several hours later Todd was there to assist as well and checked us in quickly with a big smile and great sense of humor. Sharlene appeared and provided gift bags with water a snack which was an additionally sweet gesture. The room was clean and adequate space for our stay and the continental breakfast was amazing! Many choices and all was very fresh accompanied by another great member of the staff to ensure we had everything we needed! They all made an emotional time much better with their friendly smiles, positive attitudes and great sense of humors.

"We chose this hotel based on its TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. We stayed here for five nights with our two young children and visited the zoo, Balboa Park, Sea World and Coronado during our stay. The hotel was near the zoo/Balboa Park and was a reasonable distance from Sea World and the beach. El Cajon Blvd has many ethnic (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Kosher) restaurants and the usual fast food chains. We did not see any restaurant chains such as Outback, Denny's, or Chili's near the hotel. There are several grocery and drug stores nearby. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood with our kids.Our room was clean with updated bedding and furniture and had a fridge and microwave. It was not large, but adequate for our needs. We did not have any problems with noisy neighbors or noise from the street during late-night hours. The free continental breakfast was good. The only thing I found missing was yogurt. We asked for advice and directions from the front desk several times and they never led us astray. We also purchased discount zoo tickets from the front desk. We used the pool once and it was fine.I agree with another reviewer that it is just a motel. However, we spent less than 100/night here and we were happy with our choice.",Good
Stayed for 1 night. The stay was awesome. The room is clean and spacious with 2 double bed and luscious mattres. I had the best sleep.

"My sister and I stayed here in between a week-long camping trip and a reservation at Gunshow. We were a little early for check in, but Emma was very kind and found us an available room. We had plenty of time to clean up and head to the restaurant, which was close enough to get to in a timely manner, even at rush hour. Beds were super cozy, breakfast was extensive and decent: waffles, biscuits and gravy, cereals, yogurt, fruit, good coffee. Candace checked us out and was genuinely concerned that we had a good stay. Like she owned the place concerned. Rare and wonderful service. Only complaint was our shower rod was a bit rusty and the hot/cold valve a bit temperamental. Would definitely stay here again.Julie R.

The best place I've stayed while travelling abroad. The staff are friendly and approachable. The room was amazing! They have a great continental breakfast that's so much more than just a few muffins.

We got in really early and they checked our bags so we could explore while they got our room ready and we did the same thing leaving as we had a late train departure and they were happy to keep our bags while we spent the afternoon out and about.

When they found out we were there to celebrate a special occasion my 50 Birthday they went out of there way to make me feel special. The location of the room overlooked the pool and garden. The room was beautiful, well decorated. The bed was very conferable. I believe the sheets were even a high thread count . I liked the fact that is was only 3 blocks from the excitement Bourbon Street. This made it very convenient for walking. Plan on walking everyplace. There is lots to do and see. Defiantly walk to Cafe Dumont for Cafe Au Lait and a Beignets are a must. Walk along the fresh market for some fine shopping and walk along the Mighty Mississippi and look out over the water. The hotel is close enough to get to the action but far enough away that when it is time to sleep you don't have to deal with the noise. The hotel courtyard and fountain with a nice pool is a great place to be outdoors. Continental breakfast had a great variety of choices including eggs, and a pleasant dining room overlooking the courtyard and pool.

"Stayed two nights in a room with two doubles - with our two children. It was noisy outside but we expected that as I've been to San Fran many times. Room was clean and modern which I liked. Location was great - only 2 blocks to catch the cable car and really close to all the shopping.We did have a few problems 1.) Toilet was leaking water from the back side - so there was a small puddle of water always 2.) Hotel ran out of washcloths our second night (can you believe that!) 3.) No hot water 2nd night and the next morning - had to leave early with no shower. 4.) One of the two elevators was not working and the only working one always went to the basement first no matter which button you pushed. Upon checkout the desk agent gave us a small (46 dollars to be exact) discount on our room for our inconvenience. I would have liked more of a discount, but was too annoyed to ask for it. I know it's an old building and things happen, but to run out of washcloths too.... was not good. I have never heard of that happening.I don't know if I'll stay here again. I might try one of their other properties.Dear Malia J,I am so sorry for the inconvenience you experienced during your recent stay with us. We had a number of unforseen challenges the previous week and I most certainly feel your frustration. I was frustrated myself knowing that my guests will be inconvenienced.

"Staff and facility not impressive. No hot water in room. Contacted maintenance and the guy came up to my room and said yep, no hot water.... it happens he told me that it should be better in the morning. Guess what, I had to take a cold shower next morning.They billed me for long distance calls that I never made. I haven't made an outside call from a hotel since the mobile phone age. I have called the accounting department multiple times to get the charge removed and still haven't been successful.I could go on, but the bottom line is this is a second tier hotel, not up to the JW brand name.Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel. I am sincerely sorry about your hot water issues experienced, your billing issues for phone calls and the service failures once reported. Rest assured I will follow up with our teams for immediate attention. I am hopeful you will feel free to contact me directly so that I can ensure your charges have been removed for the calls and to discuss your stay further. We take your feedback very seriously and strive to provide exceptional service. The service you received is not a standard for the JW Marriott Atlanta. I look forward to hearing for your.",Bad

"This hotel taught me something very important. Always make sure the hotel room you are getting, has a window. Lugging your luggage all around through the stairs on the multiple floors ensures this is NOT a good hotel for those who need accommodation. It's right in the middle of things, but again--no window. There is a central pool that is pretty busy, and a 24 hour ice and vending machine area. But again NO WINDOW. They don't advertise this, and won't tell you when you check in. It's a nasty little surprise if you're not careful.Hi James, thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your feedback. Our hotel has four types of accommodations - interior (windowless, but our best value), petite, deluxe, and balcony. These room types and their features are clearly indicated on our hotel's website, booking engine, and on our other online listings. Our historic property has a mixture of buildings, some of which have elevators. We suggest those who require elevator access make this request directly with our reservations department prior to check-in to ensure availability. We appreciate your kind comments about our location, and hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans.",Bad

"Had a great stay at the Del Sol Inn. We stayed in one of the bunk bed rooms which gave us a lot of room to spread out. I called ahead to find out the length of the bunk bed as we had a tall teen staying with us. They were very accommodating and measured the bed for me. I honestly cannot remember what the measurements were, but fit perfect for my friends daughter who is 5'4. Would have been a tight fit otherwise, unless you sleep curled in a ball! The hotel is set back from the street so no noise from traffic, and was a VERY short walk to the parks! You're literally across the street from the bus depot entrance! I would DEFINITLY stay here again (and plan to in May 2015)!",Good
"We only spent a day and a half in this beautiful city. But I will for sure be returning for further exploration. We stayed at the Limited Edition Ramada Inn on Lombard, down on the wharf. Clean and fairly quite accomodations. The man at the front was extremely nice though.Explored the wharf at night and in the day and thought it was fantastic. Did a trip to Alcatraz. If you haven't been I suggest a trip there. Beautiful and full of so much history. Nice day trip. As I said already didn't get much else in but that. For sure requires more time than we had to commit to..",Good
"Stayed here during Made In America weekend. The hotel was awesome and the staff was exceptional. Ms Jones was the sweetest, friendliest and kindest person you could ever want to meet. She would go out of her way to make sure you had items that you wanted or needed. Anthony as well knew all of the great spots around the area and was a charming great guy. The housekeeping staff was excellent. They tried to do whatever they could to full your requests also. The room was at a perfect temperature and very clean. The beds were comfy and we had plenty of nice towels and pillows. The staff was always warm and welcoming...will definitely come back again the next time i'm in Philly.Hello!Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback. We sincerely value and appreciate it. I will be sure to share this with Faith, Anthony and the crew! We celebrate success!Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.",Good
"This is a great place to stay, the rooms are up to date, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The bathroom was large, the room we had had 2 queen beds with a chair and desk. This was a good size for 2 people. The only issue I had is the drapes. They had regular drapes that only covered half of the window, and a sheer drape that covered the whole window. The problem is at night, there was always light shinning through the window. Not the easiest to get to sleep. The pool and pool area were very nice, they had cabanas and plenty of seating areas.We enjoyed the free breakfast, something for everyone. They had scrambled eggs (which I think were powdered), hard boiled eggs, sausage, waffles, oatmeal, cereals, breads, english muffins, muffins, yogart, bagels, fresh fruit and fruit salad. Went back for numerous servings.There was free wi-fi, however they try repeatedly to have you upgrade to a faster speed (for a fee of course).As far as location, you should either have a car so you can get to the beach or other attractions, or be prepared to catch the trolley or taxi. Not much in walking distance.Dear groozyjay,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy that you had a nice stay with us and that enjoyed our Breakfast.

"Very nice hotel and room in perfect location. Front desk staff polished and smart. Only downside was that Jose in particular really didn't want to do any more than the bare minimum for us when asked to, which was a shame as it tainted our view of the hotel. Kimpton are guilty of shamelessly ripping their customers off with a 12 dollar charge for 2 bottles of water left in our room. Would love to hear them justify that, but that's a minor point and all in all this is a good hotel with a nice pool area too.Dear UK Guest Thank you very much for the positive comments on our hotel and location and more we truly value the loyalty of our guests and recognize the investment you make in selecting our hotel among so many options in San Diego. I am sorry that a member of our staff was not responsive to your needs and expectations we review our guest surveys and comments weekly and I assure you that your feedback will discussed. Perceptions are a hard reality and our team needs this information to better understand how to improve our guest service experiences. This same feedback and information also allows us to review our operations and processes including the sale of bottled water in our guest rooms. The cost is noted on the cap but we do understand that this might be overlooked. Solamar hopes to see you back soon!Best regards, Mark DibellaGeneral Manager",Good
"This hotel is currently under reconstruction and running business as usual at the same time. Upon entering the hotel many of the carpeted areas are covered in plastic and smell like glue, although there are numerous signs directing travelers to a legend vending machines, there are none and many of the ice machines don't work properly. This week I was in had a small kitchen area, and after running the sink to wash out a couple of glasses, I returned to find a flood on the kitchen floor, calling the front desk, a maintenance man was sent, went on to rebuild the drain pipe, so the water would drain properly.There are very few walking distance stores or restaurants that are open past 11 PM in this area. Next of the front desk is extremely limited store, more of an amenity featuring bottled water and strange flavors of Gatorade. After speaking to one of the desk clerks was directed across the parking lot to their supposedly much more plush Wyndham Hotel to see if they had vending machines, which also seemed to feature bottled water and unusual flavors of Gatorade. Not exactly high quality customer service. They do offer complimentary breakfast, however that ends abruptly at 9 AM, not exactly catering as many hotels run until 10 AM and accommodating the breakfast needs of a road weary traveler as I was. This place needs an upgrade in both customer service, hotel operations, and plumbing. The kitchen and living room areas as well as the bedroom do make for an okay stay, but the overall operations need a major overhaul. I think they're capable of it, they are just not quite there yet.Thank you for your review and I am sorry about the issues you encountered. I did want to let you know that we have a 24 hour a day gift shop attached to the front desk, which has a large selection of items.Thank you again and I hope we see you again soon.",Bad

"We were in town for a wedding and had 9 rooms. The rooms were all different shapes and sizes. My room was large, with 2 queen beds, wood flooring, and a large closet. One of the rooms in our party had a king bed with a small closet. The beds were so comfortable that my mother wrote down the make and model number. I agree that the water pressure could use some improvement. The hotel is only a few blocks off of Canal Street which made it easy to walk to most of the places we wanted to go. From check-in to check-out we received excellent service. Christina and Cheryl took care of everything we needed, from suggesting restaurants, printing out directions, and ordering a cabs. There was always coffee and ice water in the lobby where we spent a good bit of time visiting with friends and family. My husband and I agree that we will return to the St. James Hotel on our next visit to New Orleans.",Good

"Location is the draw for this hotel. It has been remolded and is clean. For the price it was a disappointing. We were first given a room next to an elevator and overlooking the parking garage, we requested a room away from the elevator and were given a room next to the parking garage. The bed was good, TV was large, hot water was very very hot, watch out for this.Nice breakfast hot and cold choices.We were there on a weekend and there was no close place to have a libation after a long trip. The city is pretty quiet in this area during the weekend.However, you can walk to Little Italy and I'm sure there is refreshment there. I had not realized there would be a fourteen dollar charge per night parking and a required twenty dollar deposit for incidentals, usually hotels just ask to use the credit card on file--I think it was just the way they verbalized this that made me wonder.

"Well, My family and I went for a 3 night getaway to the Mandarin. It seemed like a fair price and a fun thing to do. Well, here was the thing. The room was pretty small... and the service was lousy. Let me tell you why. When we asked for our room to be made up while we were away for a couple hours, they said of course. We were out a couple hours and the room wasn't made up. Then we called again. They said of course again. And we went back out for a few hours to get lunch. Yet, when we returned the room wasn't made up!! Now, if you want to get a bite at Cafe Sambal that's another story. (It was amazing) But, do not stay here. The grounds are nice, and so is Cafe Sambal but nothing else.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your recent review of Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. Your constructive comments are very important to us. I am delighted that you enjoyed your dining experience in Caf Sambal it is truly one of the best sushi restaurants in Miami having been recently voted top five by Passport Miami in one of their recent readers poll. Regarding the rest of your stay back in May, I am saddened to hear that your experience fell short and that you felt the room was small. We have many different category rooms all of which are on par in size with other luxury choices in the Miami. Please ask a reservation agent for more options and prices that may better fulfill your expectations. Pertaining to the lapse in service by housekeeping, we sincerely apologize that the room was not cleaned in the timeframe you requested. We do our best to accommodate all service requests. This is definitely an isolated incident that has been addressed with the housekeeping management to ensure it does not re-occur. I hope you will give us another opportunity and request that you contact the Executive Office for your future reservation. I will ensure you have a seamless and enjoyable visit. Sincerely, Greg Nunez Hotel Manager",Bad
"I was pleasantly surprised at the room with a king size bed, it was lovely, everything is modernized. I had to stay in my room a lot, there was an extra chair and coffee table to sort out my things.

"My friend and I have stayed here twice on two different trips to the San Diego area. It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough! It's easy freeway access off/on the 8 along hotel row.Dear Jeannette:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are glad you enjoyed our convenient and freeway accessible location, which is close to all San Diego has to offer. It is also great knowing you appreciated our complimentary parking and clean guestrooms. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback.

My husband and I booked on line to stay at Pacific Inn for 1 week out of our 2 week vacation. The rooms are clean and offer a microwave and small refrigerator. Which is perfect for breakfast or lunch in your room or leftovers later on. The rooms are a bit dated but very comfortable! The owners here Rick and his wife are fantastic! If you need some extra hangers or towels they are so happy and accommodating ! The owners here make you feel at home. so at home we cancelled the other hotel we were going to stay at for the second week and the other hotel offered a pool!

We had the chance to spend some off-time at the lobby bar (...in the lobby) and the servers were impeccable. I can't say enough on how accommodating they were for our large group but in the end what made this a memorable event was Ron Romero from Banquets.

"Depending on your needs this hotel is fine. The pluses are that it is recently remodeled and the dinner menu is really nice and that food is good. The negatives are the breakfast buffet is really anemic, not like any other Hilton Garden Inn I've stayed at before.

"Comfort Suites Michigan Ave/Loop is in a perfect location. Midway between the museums and shopping located just steps from the Chicago River. We had a very generously-sized suite with full kitchen and plenty of room to move around in. Everything was clean. Details: the bathroom door didn't fit/hard to close vanity drawers opened into door-jam towels were not replaced consistently and there wasn't dishwashing soap in the kitchen. For the entire week, some channels on tv weren't available (Basic Cable) the lobby computers were down.Staff were always helpful and pleasant but some things were out of their control.The actual toilet/tub room was beyond small. The overall bathroom would be better served if the door was placed on the hallway.For the price and convenience, this was an acceptable place to stay and I would stay there again.Dear JSharp2014,Thank you for your recent review. I am so happy that you enjoyed our team's service and the size of the rooms. I do apologize for the door not closing properly and the replacement of towels and we will look into this and have it corrected. We don't offer dish washing soap in our suites for the reason that our housekeeping team cleans all of the dishes daily.

The lady at recpetion was nice and helpful. We stayed in room number 317. It was nice, clean and spacious room. It definitely suited our needs! Everyone is saying it is dirty- but we didn't think so.

"I flew in from a deployment to Afghanistan and met my family in Atlanta. We chose the hotel because of its proximity to the stadium. When we got our room we noticed a few problems: the futon bed/sofa had both back legs broken or detached. When my kids sat on it they nearly fell back into the wall. When I told the from desk they just put a roll away bed in the room (which you could feel every spring through). The shower faucet was falling off the wall as well. When I reported to the front desk they just didnt seem to care. When I called down for linen for the toll away bed they told me to come get it myself- because only one worker on duty. Just less than impressed with the stay. Unfortunate because the location is great. Thank you for staying at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria lisadJ4273!

"Spent two days here prior to a conference that was being held at nearby Moscone Center.Took BART from Airport to this hotel - very easy and fast. Hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Montgomery Street station. Arrived at Noon - room was not yet ready. Front Desk attendant took my phone number and said they would call when room become available - but they never called. Not a big problem - I went out and enjoyed the sights. Came back around 3:30 and was then able to check-into my room. Was given a north-facing room on the top floor (top floor of hotel, that is - the upper floors of the building are for the St. Regis Residences). Room decor was very serene and calming. Never heard anything from outside or other quests while I was here! Bathroom was especially nice, with lots of room, wonderful amenities, rainforest shower and separate soaking tub. Everything in the room seemed fine, except for my master-control panel - some of the features just wouldn't work (phone, radio control, etc.) - I never called for assistance, just got by with using the other phone (think there were four phones total in the room). Bed and linens were OMG spectacular. Slept like a baby and felt wonderful when I woke up!Took any early morning swim in the pool - very nice - and it was great that the pool is open 24/7. Fitness center was well-equipped, and super clean.Ate Breakfast at the hotel restaurant - which was lovely, but quite expensive. Lobby bar and main restaurant looked lovely, but I didn't have a chance to experience them. Visited the Museum of African Diaspora which is accessible from first floor of the hotel - very nice place. The hotel has a great location for visiting the fine arts museums - many within a block or two - Yerba Beuna Gardens, Jewish Heritage, Museum of Modern Art. Also just a couple blocks from the high-end shopping of Union Square.If you are seeking a space of serene luxury in the heart of the SF hustle and bustle, the St Regis definitely delivers.",Good

"A nice take on a boutique hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Very good location in the middle of all the attractions down by Pier 39, Ghiardelli Square, Cable Car turnaround and the F Streetcar Line. Really interesting decor in the main lobby, like the reuse of shipping containers. And a great courtyard area with plenty of seats, fire pits and all kinds of things to do.A good, clean and comfortable room. Rooms facing the courtyard (like mine) have balconies, nice views out to the Bay. No bigger or smaller than other hotel rooms in the area, but nicely updated decor.Helpful staff - efficient and knowledgeable. Nothing fancy, just good. Maybe trying to be a little too hip, but can't fault people for trying.Didn't mind sacrificing two nights worth of points.Hi mastiffdad,Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Zephyr!mastiffdad, I am very happy to hear that you found our location to be so convenient, we really have the best location of the Wharf!

"Got a nice room (1715) on 17th floor, but woke up three times at night because somebody must have run the tap or had a shower. When having a shower in the beautful seperate shower cabin, twice I adjusted the water temperature, stood under the shower for a minute or so when the water got really scorchingly hot and I had to move away from it, turn down the temperature, almost turning the water off, wait a minute for it to cool down, then feel it got really cold. Back to the original setting and eventually enjoy the shower.Sorry guys, at 490 a night that's not okay. Noise plus burning yourself is not acceptable.One more thing I hate: Monday night 7.30, I want to go jogging and ask for steam room/sauna after jog.

"I stayed here for one night on business. It was fine.Pros: comfy bed, quiet for such a busy area, seemingly clean, the price was ok at 70/nt.Cons: although this hotel is updated, it's really just trendy furniture and paint covering up the age of the place. The fixtures are all rusted in the bathroom and you can't look too deep into the room. Also, the housekeeper knocked on my door three times between 9-10am to lean my room. Although I appreciate her diligence, I told her I would be leaving around 10:15. She could not understand or speak English very well so maybe that was the issue but it was a bit annoying.Overall it was an average experience. For business, it was fine because all I need is a comfy bed, quiet, and a clean (ish) room!Thank you for taking the time to share your experience while staying with us.

"I initially reserved a room, on my own, at the Knights Inn Market Center in Dallas, Texas. The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call. Thank you for your feedback, your feedback is very valuable to us since it helps us improve our services.",Bad

"They say they have a beach. It's man made and you can't go in the water. The gym is too hot to work out in. The closet does not accommodate any long hang, such as a dress. In fact, a suit had to be hung in the bathroom because it was also too long. The bathroom has zero storage space, so things need to go in the closet that has no space. The bathroom and room are large, so none of this makes any sense. Housekeeping has issues as well. Shouldn't have to hunt them down for amenities that have run out. No coffeepot in the room. And needed to call maintenance to get the room cool enough in weather that isn't hot. The ironing board was in the room and served as auxiliary hanging space.

"My boyfriend and I just returned from The Chelsea after our stay on Saturday the 12th. We are both local (we both live in Absecon, 10 minutes outside of Atlantic City). Since we live so close, we rarely splurge and spend the on a room for one evening. This year we wanted to celebrate Valentine's day with a special treat. Our friend Eddie, an employee of the Chelsea, suggested spending a night there. We looked online and were really excited by the photos. We appreciated the art deco decor and throwback feel of the hotel. When we checked in, the front desk employee informed us that we would be in the Annex portion of the hotel. Our room was A DISASTER!! Main lamp was broken, shower mat was filthy, shower head completely off the wall, tv did not work, the toilet did not fliush and the room WAS NOTHING LIKE what was portrayed on the website. When we went to the front desk, the manager said there was nothing they could do about the room or the toilet. He said he would comp our breakfast the next morning. We found out later that the Annex portion of the hotel was being gutted next week. That is all well and good, but this should have been made clear when the reservation was made.

There was only 1 shower on each floor so plan your showering time accordingly. Despite the ageing building everything was kept clean by the staff.We had a constant water trickling noise in our room from pipes behind a wall. As with most hostels, ear plugs are essential.

"I will start with the only positive. The staff at the front desk, restaurant and bar areas were friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was rather disgusting. The decor is gaudy and dated. Even accounting for that subjective opinion (design styles can differ of course, some of my colleagues liked the ambiance) the cleanliness was lacking. Upon checkin my room had hairs on the bathroom counter and the floor had not been mopped. The bathtub was filthy. The carpet areas were stained. The climate control in the room was terrible. Instead of a thermostat there was the old style manual control box AC unit under the window. It didn't work properly and it was LOUD. So the options were either freezing cold or humid and muggy (considering it was almost 40 degrees and humid in Dallas at the time of my stay). It was near impossible to get a comfortable sleep. The air unit was loud and the only settings available was max or off. I would get too cold, turn it off, then get too hot and in the middle of the night get up and turn it back on. This was repeated all night for the 3 nights I stayed. Suffice to say I slept maybe 4-5 hours in total. I would never recommend anyone stay here unless it was necessary and there were no other alternatives. One other note, be careful if you take the shuttle somewhere. My coworkers and I took a shuttle to a nearby restaurant and told the driver to come back and pick us up by 10pm. Well he never showed and after waiting 15min we called the hotel. That driver had left his shift and not told his replacement. So we were finally picked up at almost 1045pm. That driver was apologetic and it wasn't his fault.",Bad

"In the middle of a cross country move this hotel gave me exactly what I needed: accommodation for my pets, a downstairs room, and a clean quiet place to sleep.

"This was probably one of my least favorite hotel stays ever. The rooms were cleanish, though there was pink mold all over the shower in the bathroom. Had to ask to get the room cleaned. The pool is literally on Roosevelt Boulevard, so you cannot escape the sound of traffic driving by. Not relaxing at all. Worst though was the front desk: every time I went there there would be two people behind the desk and yet only one working, answering phones and dealing with guests at the same time. Took forever to check in, get pool towels, get an extra key... Probably would not stay here again unless desperate.Dear tdeluzuraga,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. I want to apologize for not being up to the standards that a Marriott should be. I thank you for the all the comments you provide and will be sharing to the rest of my Team so that we can give attention to these details.

"We paid quite a bit to upgrade to a suite. Basically, it's a long narrow room with a divider between the window and the bed. The actual bedroom is very small and the sitting area is even smaller. The A/C is in the sitting area and you must keep the door open to allow cool air to flow into the bedroom. The additional daily parking fee exasperated the problem. The hotel sits next to the interstate but the noise did not seem to bother us once we were inside the room. The breakfast which was included was more than adequate.Dear RobertPC118,First of all I want to thank you for taking the time to let me know your experience. I can assure you that we will use this information to look at the room configuration since we are currently reviewing plans to upgrade the property by renovating to improve our conditions. I am glad you enjoyed the breakfast. If you decide to visit us, please contact me directly at 619.881.4001.

"Don't stay here. Housekeeping seems to be useless, you can find dirt everywhere and staff is really unfriendly. I stayed here for two weeks and couldn't wait to run somewhere else. Besides no amenities in the hotel. Look for other options.Thank you for telling us about your stay. We are disappointed to hear that you did not have an enjoyable experience with us. Please accept our apologies. We will work with our housekeeping staff to ensure all areas of our hotel meet our standards moving forward.Thank you again for your feedback.

"The train is right in front of the hotel. Take this to go to Pike's Market, unless if you want to walk for 30 minutes. This hotel is across the water, so make sure to request your room to be on that side. The interiors are dated 80's to 90's style. Be prepared to pay for parking.",Good
"Make sure you have your walking shoes if you book this old hotel in Seattle as the hill to enter is steep. The rooms are charming and dated back to past times. You can open the windows in your room to enjoy the fresh Seattle air as the AC does not pump out a great amount of air. Good location to enjoy all the surrounding downtown sites. Hi Captain Tony - Thank you for your review! Yes, walking shoes for getting around Seattle is a must. . .five hills make up the city and our First Hill is one of them (but actually not the steepest!). We hope you'll stay with us again when your travels bring you back to Seattle.",Good
"Pros: Hotel location 5 min walk to Union Square in a busy neighborhood. The view from my 19th floor hotel room was nice. The room fridge is small but they leave 1/2 of it empty so you can use it for your own bottled water or drinks. It is tiny though, you definitely can't store dinner or lunch leftovers in it. Just small things like fruit or a cupcake. For 20 per room per stay, you can access the fitness center and pool. The pool is heated and there is a small 5 person hot tub, sauna and steam room in the locker area. All of which are very clean. The fitness center is a decent size for a hotel fitness center and it's clean!!! I never had to wait for a treadmill or any other machine. The hotel room has a weight scale so you can check in on your weight, I give this a thumbs-up since I care about my weight while on a business trip. The hotel serves a complimentary glass of California wine at happy hour to hotel guests, which is a nice touch.Cons: I stayed here while attending a conference with 60,000 attendees so hotel prices were a premium everywhere in the city. My company paid 600 a night to stay at this hotel but it is definitely not worth 600/night. The room (1 King Bed) was tiny. There is a 15.95 charge for 24 hours of Internet. Ugh.Dear wandersfreely,Thank you for reviewing your stay at Hotel Nikko. We are so thrilled to hear that you took full advantage of our fitness center while on your business trip and that you were very impressed with the exercise and pool facilities. During busy weeks when all of the hotels in the city are impacted by huge events it is true that each hotel experiences a rise in price per night, but we hope that you were able to enjoy yourself anyways. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you come back and visit us again soon! Best Wishes, Marcia Striffeler",Neutral

"The Good:-Clean rooms.-Room service twice daily.-Room size is adequate.-Valet parking gets your car fast and parks it fast as well.-Hotel looks clean and nice in general.The Bad:-There is no private beach as advertized, it is a small, man-made beach, with no access to water.-The pool is very small compared to the size of the hotel.-Valet parking is mandatory and costs 34 per day, other (and better) hotels charge only 30 per day.-The fan in the bathroom in our room did not work and was not fixed despite complainig.-The toilette flush in our bathroom takes FOREVER to refill and was not fixed despite complaining (I have used the so-called ECO flushed in many older and modern hotels, so I know how it is supposed to work, ours was not functionning normally, nor as intended.-The batrhoom sink did not drain, they fixed it after we complained.-The hotel rooms show unusual signs of aging, despite the hotel being only around 10yrs. old.-The staff is arrogant and border-line rude (except for the valet parking guys, who are great).-The food at the hotel is marginal, the fruits in our 60 breakfast for 2 were NOT fresh, and we could not eat them. - As staff was so arrogant and our previous complaints were ignored (regarding the bathroom issues) we did not even bother complaining about stale fruits posing as fresh ones...we were happy it was our last day.-In general I recommend Trump and Sofitel hotels over Mandarin Oriental.Dear Guest,Thank you for your recent review of Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. We sincerely apologize that your visit did not meet your expectations. Our private beach is not promoted as one for swimming but for relaxing and enjoying the stunning views. The tranquility and surroundings of our pool and beach provide a quiet escape for our guests.I am sorry to learn of the plumbing related issues. I will address this with our Engineering team to ensure there are no further problems.Additionally, I regret to hear the lapse in service you indicated by our staff. We pride ourselves in ensuring all our colleagues deliver quality service and genuine hospitality to our guests and make sure their visit is seamless and enjoyable. Please understand we only purchase quality, fresh produce and turn away anything that is not up to our standards. As far as the pricing, we are competitively priced with other luxury hotels in the area.With regards to the valet parking, due to the limited space available for parking facilities in the area, we do need to charge a fee for overnight stays. Most Miami hotels experience the same situation and charge rates equivalent or higher.I do apologize again that your stay was not an enjoyable experience.SincerelyJorge GonzalezGeneral Manager",Bad
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Windsor Inn. I stayed there for 7 nights at the beginning of October. The front desk staff was amazing and were quick to offer suggestions. The housekeeping staff was great as well, my room was always clean. The hotel itself is newly renovated.The hotel is a quick walk from Seaworld and provides a free shuttle to Disney. The free breakfast was pretty standard but had some of the best hotel coffe Ive experienced. On the nights that I didnt eat supper at the parks, I ate at a nearby restaurant called Village Inn. I usually just ate breakfast for supper but it was good and reasonably priced.Im looking forward to returning for my next trip!Thank you for your kind comments. We are always pleased to hear that guests enjoyed their stay with us. We are now called the Best Western Plus Orlando Convention Center Hotel. We have upgraded a few more things since your stay.

There was a walkway along the beach so we could stroll to the Black Rock. The parking lot was very spacious and convenient. We were able to buy several kinds of foods at Kauhale Market in the resort. The meals at Mauka Makai Restaurant were excellent.Aloha 2011SK,Mahalo nui loa for posting your review.

"This is not a fancy hotel, BUT, it was the CLEANEST hotel I have ever stayed in, in the USA. Even with the kitchenette in the room - the entire place was sparkling. We cooked in the room and did not miss any tools. We bought basic groceries for one dinner and Washington wines at Safeway. The hotel offers free grocery shopping service. The complimentary breakfast is wonderful - truly something for everyone. I hit the yogurt bar, the oatmeal bar, and the hot buffet over the course of a week. My husband went for the Thai Green Curry and Rice every morning. Hot beverages are available around the clock.The staff was friendly and helpful.Public transportation is close, but we opted for Uber rather than take our rental car - parking around town is pricey.",Good
"From the street you could easily drive past the hotel and not know it was there. A lovely quaint, brick building dating back to the 1800's. We had an interior room, without windows and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was large and clean with a good sized bathroom. Probably, the lighting was a little too subdued - one or two bright reading lamps would be good. The location is great wonderful New Orleans vibe, plenty of restaurants close by, easy walk to Bourbon Street and opposite the river. The interior brick court yard was a lovely place to sit and relax but we didn't spend too much time doing this. Wonderful staff - very warm and friendly. Would definitely stay here again.Hi Pat, thank you for your feedback. Your kind comments about our historic hotel are appreciated.

Would have like to have breakfast included at this price.Dear Smrboston,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent family vacation experience at Hotel Sorrento.We were thrilled that you enjoyed your visit! Your comment regarding breakfast is well received. We have been discussing lately the cost surprise that many Guests have with breakfast. We currently offer a BB package which is very useful and a better value and by the end of July we are testing a coffee feature in our fireside lounge, for the busy morning period that will offer delicious and quick options, along with the Dunbar's regular sit down menu.

"Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is a little tired but clean.I had a single room and would approx the size as 7ft by 15ft (hotel site may confirm). The view was to the apartments opposite and an alleyway below. I took earplugs as Ive been to NYC before and its noisy. The room had a singe bed, wardrobe, desk and mounted tv. Also had an ensuite. Rooms a little tired but again - clean. The toiletries were of a good standard which was a nice surprise.No breakfast facilities in the hotel - coffee and tea is available to take out in the mornings from a trolley in reception. The best thing about this hotel is its location. 5 mins from Broadway (Times Sq) - cant fault it.I will be back!!Dear Shy,Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay.

"My first trip to New Orleans and French Market Inn was so pretty....the staff was very kind and there was 24 hour security at the entrance. The check in process was quick, took less than 10 mins. to get into our room. The Petite room we chose with a window which looked onto the side street, fixtures in the room didnt give off much light but it didn't really bother me. Both the room and bathroom were comfortably small giving a very cozy atmosphere. Location of the Inn was perfect and within walking distance to all the area attractions, when we needed a break from walking we would come back to the room and rest for an hour or so and hit the streets again. The French Market Inn will be the only place I stay at whenever I come back to New Orleans.",Good
"I'm kind of a regular at this hotel. The front desk staff is really great. I see Crystal most of the time. Every time though she makes you feel welcome and is glad to see you. She also prepares the continental breakfast too. Crystal goes the extra mile for us drivers that come in early with having the breakfast set-up earlier than expected!The rooms are consistently clean and new coffee makers makes the stay a whole lot better. I'm a day sleeper when I stay, noise level is average. Nighttime is real quiet.Dear Mike BThank you for taking the time to place a review on behalf of the hotel. I am glad to hear that you enjoy interacting with the staff specially Crystal. Crystal does do a very good job while working the audit shift. She does go above and beyond to accommodate our guest.

"We booked this hotel as it offered close proximity to the the centre of New Orleans and it offered disabled facilities in 'superior' rooms. We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that. If there is further information you would like me to review, please don't hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager",Bad

"Brand new hotel and a great bargain at 89 per night plus tax. As others mentioned, there was NO RESORT FEE, which was the main reason we chose the Hampton over the nearby Renaissance and Hilton hotels. Our family (all adults) found the Hampton's location convenient. It took only a few minutes walk to the Seaworld parking lot, then crossing the lot to the main entrance took a few more minutes. There are not many businesses in walking distance of the hotel, other than a Bonefish restaurant and a Walgreens store, but several new buildings are being constructed nearby. If the City, Seaworld, and/or Hilton plan the area to be more pedestrian friendly, it will be a big draw for travelers. Rooms are nicely furnished. Beautiful bathrooms, although the only lighting option was VERY bright and the fan was weak (just minor issues). We definitely took advantage of the Hampton's daily breakfast and we appreciated the free coffee and tea, which was available in the lobby 24/7.",Good

"This is a standard motel with the typical budget-type amenities, i.e., fridge, microwave, hair dryer, crappy little bottles of shampoo-plus-conditioner in one, free continental breakfast, and so forth, but it really stands out because the mattress was SO GOOD. The mattress here was as good as the mattresses I've had at four star hotels that cost four times as much money. The room was very clean. I could safely walk around in my socks and the bottom of my socks didn't get brown and dirty. The service was very friendly. When we arrived, the hotel staff had folded the bathroom towels into an adorable elephant sculpture that the kids adored. The kids also loved the pool. We also made use of the on-site coin laundry. I would definitely stay here again. Minor drawbacks: parking lot was full so we had to use the hotel's complimentary valet service one night. And the free breakfast is no frills (but more than adequate) -- corn flakes, Cheerios, juice, coffee, milk, toast, mini muffins, toaster waffles, pastries, and a few small apples.",Good

"This was the hotel our son and daughter-in-law chose for out-of-town wedding guests for the days surrounding their wedding. The rooms were stylish, newly-renovated, super clean (large rain shower bathroom), and the beds were very comfortable. The staff and admin were all so welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay and even let us enjoy the pool area after checkout! There was a Happy Hour party the night before the wedding and lots of guests were hanging out around the pool for several days (and nights!) surrounding the wedding. The vibe at the hotel was very chill. The food at the hotel restaurant was very good, according to those who ate there. The day after the wedding, we were up early and had coffee from the free continental breakfast area, but walked to a nearby diner rather than wait for the restaurant to open. There was even a free yoga class going on by the pool that morning. I would highly recommend this hotel for its ambiance, value, and comfort.Seems that everyone from the wedding group enjoyed their stay last weekend and thank you for leaving us a lovely review!",Good
"We had originally booked at the PB Surf Beachside Inn, but the afternoon prior to our arrival I received a call from the front desk informing me we were being moved to the sister property a block away. I was not thrilled with the change as I had spent many hours pondering, looking at pictures, maps, and reviews on the internet before making the selection. When we arrived and saw the room, it was nice enough, but you could tell it was only halfway remodeled. There we obvious upgrades, nice BIG new TV, nice little fridge and microwave, however the old curtains were still up, and the floor was carpeted, not tiled. The bathroom was upgraded, but also unfinished, as the shower grout and chalking was not finished around the bottom....which allowed water flow out the shower, under the wall and into the carpet in the room. We discovered this as our socks got soaked as we walked into the bathroom across the soggy carpet.Front desk was very helpful. When we turned our TV on, there was no cable. When we called the front desk, she cheerfully came down and immediately found the problem, the cable was not plugged into the TV. She also told us to let management know about the leaky shower when we checked out...which we did, and they got us a reasonable discount.The location is superb! It's a couple minutes walk to the beach, and there is a nice grassy park above the beach on the little bluff with great views. Many reasonably priced restaurants in walking distance.We will be back, and hope to get a fully finished room...at which point the review will be 4 or 5 instead of 3!Of course, we would love to receive a 5! But, I do understand your issues, and I believe I met you while I was picking up some paperwork at the desk.

"We drove down to AC for a night and called The Chelsea. They never explained the difference between their Annex and main hotel. We didn't know we were staying in the Annex until we checked in. It was disgusting, loud, and felt unsafe. The hotel room doors slammed shut all night long and it was loud until 3:30 am. For 350/night you expect a much cleaner, well-maintained and professional environment. Management did not even contact us about our experience after leaving a comment card about the condition of the room, which leads you to believe they either don't care or have heard it all before. Also, you can forget about using the roof top deck that they pump up so much on their website. They try and charge you 30/person to get in, up sell you with bottle service when the environment is so scummy and gross. For every Jersey Shore Meathead present, there is a security guard covered in tattoos. It's just a weird, unsafe and uneventful scene.",Bad
We stayed for business. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and full of history. The beds were very comfortable. If I had to make a suggestion............something to make coffee or tea in the room would be an added perk.,Good

"We had a lovely Christmas staycation at the Grand Hyatt Seattle (seriously, we took the bus from our home in Redmond to get here).We were greeted with a hot chocolate and christmas cookie bar... as well as an upgrade to a water view room!The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main downtown sites. We ordered room service for breakfast and were happy with our waffles. There is a Starbucks right downstairs, so we got coffee from there and brought it back up for a Christmas Eve treat.The workout room was really high end and clean. There was also a sauna and hot tub - I wish I brought my swimsuit!The Grand Hyatt made our staycation overnight stay very special.",Good
"Older hotel. Always clean. Staff is always pleasant. Todd at the front desk must have a stash of happy pills. They will eventually loose Brenda at a high pay waitress job, as she can do it.

"This hotel is located in Biscayne Bay, the hotel overlooks the Bay. The rooms have a balcony which get a constant cool breeze which is quite a relief from the sweltering temperatures out there.Check in was easy, minor annoyance is when they ask if you want to upgrade for X which drags the whole experience down a notch. However, given a nice cool drink and cold towel on arrival.The suite was clean with good products and fresh fruit. Be sure to ask for an iron and ironing board prior to arriving.Breakfast buffet was good, we were there during the Sony Ericsson open so there was a high profile tennis star there during breakfast. Spa treatments were high end. I would return here again.",Good

"Came here with family and dog for 2 nights on New Years Eve. Wine / champagne reception was fun with lots of room to spread out. Room was comfortable. Bathroom tiny. Not much of a view. Our dog loved the room and was very excited to be here. Love the Kimpton hotels. Starbucks next door, but not too much else around for dining. Hello Dragonfly1004,We are so happy you, your family, and pup enjoyed your time with us, especially at our social hour!

"I have no idea what all the complaints are about with this vintage, friendly, accomodating,centrally located Inn. From Ken, who was sitting outside at 7:30 a.m. in the morning when Iarrived and waited til I checked in to even carry my bag upstairs and absolutely refused totake a tip from me, to T. J., who by telephone was able to change my room and was sovery friendly at check-in and check-out and even offered to lock up my luggage aftercheck out time. They are both keepers and with a small inconvenience of deluxe roomsit was worth it to meet these kind of people in a big city environment where people aremore concerned about the almighty dollar than treating people with cordiality. My experiencein Atlanta will be remembered because I decided to stay at the Highland Inn instead of ahotel chain. Keep up the great atmostphere and positive greetings and helpfulness toyour guests! Much Appreciated.Wow! Thank you for your 5-star review. We really appreciate you sharing your experience with potential guests and for the kind words about our location and staff!

"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Bad

"The hotel room and bathroom were clean. No smoke odor or any other odor. Sheet and towers were clean. Everything work in my room (TV, lights, heater). My room was for one person really. They have bigger room too. For the price this is a nice hotel and close to must of the attractions (walking distant).TV work fine. It only have a table and a chair only, the bed and to night stand.Be careful if you park in the back of the hotel, take anything that will attract the attention. There are lot on homeless etc... but they won't bother you. I was walking late at night (2AM) with no problem. The room with the ice and soda machine was close. But they are around place to buy ice an anything else. Subway restaurant is across the street and lots if Vietnamese restaurants in the block. If you want a fancy hotel, this one if not for you. This is for people that will be out all day and return to take a shower and go sleep and watch tv while relaxing.",Neutral
"If you like King rooms, be prepared not to have a bath. None of their King rooms have baths, only showers. I could not properly wash my hair with a tiny showerhead. Many King rooms have communicating doors to the next room, which are good noise-carriers. With regard to noise: the rooms at the freeway end of the hotel are very noisy, much more so than other hotels we've stayed in on Hotel Circle South. We were living out of our suitcases because of the ridiculous size of the drawers in the room (basically the size of nightstand drawers - see picture). The pool is the size of a large hot-tub. Breakfast had many items but lacked quality: the only good things we found were yoghurt and fresh fruit, cooked food was poor.Hotel staff were helpful and did their best to resolve our issues in a not-so-great hotel. Next San Diego visit: back to the Doubletree.",Bad

"We stayed for only 1 night, but found the hotel easy to access, had a comfortable room, helpful staff and a nice, hot breakfast. The hotel is located right next to I-5 so be aware that there could be a noise issue if you are sensitive to that issue. There is a 24-Hour fitness located across the street that you can access for a fitness center which would be great if you were staying for several nights. The breakfast was hot and the staff was attentive and making sure that all dishes were filled promptly. The room was comfortable - basic, but spacious for our night. We walked to a nearby restaurant for dinner and passed several others on the way. Like many downtown locations, I was comfortable walking in a group, but wouldn't walk alone. Close to several outdoor type stores.",Good
"Just got back from SD and five nights at the Pearl. Kimberly Parker and her staff did a terrific job in taking care of all of our needs and making us feel very welcomed!

"We stayed two nights. The hotel is deceptive from the outside - it looks very plain and ordinary but it is just the opposite on the inside. The lobby is very attractive and welcoming. The room was clean, comfortable and large with vaulted ceilings and very tastefully decorated. We enjoyed the happy hour with three free alcoholic drinks each and hot and cold snacks. Breakfast was also included - fairly typical choices of cereal, scrambled eggs etc.. The staff were very friendly. It's in a great location - the cable car stops out front and it's an easy 5 minute walk to Bourbon St. We will definitely stay here again.",Good
We have stayed here two other times before this. The staff on evening and morning shift were very pleasant and helpful. The rooms were clean and quiet. In the am we had car trouble and the staff was helpful to direct us to the nearest car dealer.,Good
"First off,the price. 50 / night for a hotel is unheard of. You aren't going to get a lot of luxury of course. What you DO get is a FULL kitchen. Stove, full-sized fridge, microwave to go along with a very clean room. You can see some signs of aging, but nothing that would ever stop me from visiting again... More",Good
"All my negatives about this hotel will be about the bathroom, other than that it was very good. It is the old Radisson Hotel that has just had a massive upgrade. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is bright and airy. The courtyard outside is excellent of an evening with lovely places to sit and games for kids and adults. In the reception area, again is a lovely large area for people to chill out and the games room is again for kids and adults alike. The rooms and big, very comfortable and the beds some of the best i have had in a hotel. However, the bathroom falls down for me. You have a mssive bathroom and no shelf space to put toiletries or even the bathh towels which are kept in the wardrobe. There is so much space to put a few small shelves the bathroom is just wasted. Again in the shower area there rae no shelving at all to hang toiletries. The bathhroom door again is a massive negative and be very careful closing it from the inside as the handles are so close to the edge you will catch your fingers.The bathroom is just a small negative for me as it we stayed in San Francisco again we would definately stay here. It's dissapointing there isn't a small bar area or breakfast area but again that is very minor as you have Johnny Rockets attached to the hotel that is more than suitable for breakfast.Overall a very good hotel right on Fishermans Wharf with just a few minor irritations and we would 100 stay here again.Hi Davek200000,Thank you very much for taking the time to write about your stay at Zephyr!Yes, we had a massive upgrade! 32 million were spent to create our new phenomenal hotel!I am so glad to hear you were able to enjoy all the fun offerings we have between our game room and our yard!

"We made arrangements to stay at the Courtyard Downtown Orlando overnight while we attended an event at Camping World Stadium. I called ahead and confirmed that the hotel actually did have a shuttle that ran until 11pm which was a definite plus. The shuttle driver JJ, not only dropped us off close to the venue, but also mentioned he would meet us at a spot for a pickup at the end of the event. As it turned out the concert didnt finish until 11:30, but JJ was at the spot as arranged. All the staff was friendly and efficient, JJ went over the top to make our and several others experience, a perfect stay.",Good

"We stayed for 7 nights at the Bienville House in New Orleans over Christmas 2011. The stay was wonderful! We were able to switch rooms to one with a view of the Mississippi and to be able to see the ships and even the Natchez cruise by our window was great. The only concern was the street noise at night but it was the holidays and the French Quarter was full of visitors so it was sort of expected. This boutique hotel was decorated very nicely, the king 4 poster beds were exceptional and even the continental breakfast served from 7:00 - 10:00 am was pretty good.

"This property has only been here six years. It reminds of the La Quinta Resort and Spa in La Quinta, just east of Palm Desert. We got a great price then upgraded to a suite for only 49 more. The rooms was spacious and nicely appointed. The Suite was secluded from other rooms with a private entrance which made it seem more special. We also had our valet parking comped. Along with top shelf, we are here to serve you attitude, which is not that common these days. Smiles abound from the staff and the place is marvelously appointed. Two highlights were the heavenly bedding and a light in the closet which is motion sensor before the door actually opens. The TV in the living room was undersized to the higher end hotels.

We came in late and asked to have the pull out ready so we could put our girls to bed and were happy to find everything ready for us. The staff is great and would always greet us by name as we came and went. They provided us with great snacks for the whole family to enjoy. It is always nice having the wine social hour and meeting other guests. There is construction going on right across the street. We were provided ear plugs, but since our little one wakes us up we were up before the work began (about 7am).

There are a ton of restaurants within walking distance (over by Amazon). I'd prefer to self park instead of valet park though. The rooms are nice enough and they have a mini-fridge and microwave.Carolyn, I'm thrilled that you enjoyed your stay with us! I know there are a lot of choices around this area, so it's great for me to read that we impressed you. We'd love to have you back for your next trip to Seattle -- let us know when you're coming back!Safe travels, Frank F., General Manager",Good
"The hotel was hard to find at night but once we checked into a 1BR 2 queen suite, there was nothing but the best service. The rooms were clean and the living room was ample for relaxation in the evening. Large dining area for the hot cold breakfast and rarely delay for the mickey mouse waffle machines. The weekday family style supper salad were appreciated for a fast meal after a long day at disney. Beer wine were available upon request. The food service was great but I don't know why few people tip the friendly kitchen staff. Free wifi everywhere in the hotel and the business center had 2 computers and a full size printer copier to print out notes for the trip. The pool was not cold and the shallow area was safe even for an infant. Exercise machines were available at the Hilton garden inn next door but I didn't have time to try them. Limited coin laundry machines available. Didn't use the kitchen much with free breakfast supper but it had all the cooking necessities when we needed them, including microwave dish washer. Nicely located 5 minutes from downtown disney or a walmart supercenter and not too far from seaworld. The only disadvantage was the I-4 next to the hotel which could be noisy but I was lucky to have a quiet courtyard facing room.",Good
"We were charged for the first night of stay even though we were not in SF yet due to a sudden death in the family. In addition, the room we were given the next day was one of the smallest I've ever had, even though we had requested ahead of time to an upgrade. Told we didn't get the upgrade because we weren't there to check in. Throughout our four-night stay, one elevator was out of service and the other was very slow. We resorted to using the stairs to our third floor room. At checkout, we waited almost 15 minutes for an elevator because our luggage was too heavy to carry down the stairs. HOWEVER, for our final three nights we were upgraded to an Oasis Suite for no additional charge (beyond the night we were charged and didn't use). Very quiet, spacious room facing courtyard. Location is great for all SF tourist activities and shopping. Ate one night in the Italian restaurant. It was decent and the service was good. If check-in and the first night had been better, I'd give it a 5, but the poor first impression dropped the overall score. Hope both elevators are now functioning!",Good
Best spot on Waikiki - the views are magnifient. Staff are lovely. Rooms recently renovated. Prices reasonable. Close to everything. Able to watch the Hula shows from our balcony. Hoping to go again next year and wouldn't stay anywhere else.,Good
"Staff was friendly and out going. Room was clean and received room service while out with the family. Very happy to have stayed at this place. Only thing i did not like was I could hear everything going on outside beyond closed doors as it woke me up each time I heard someone speak or doors slammed. Perhaps better insulation would help with that issue. Other than that, everything else was great! Thanks for a good stay! It was a pleasure hosting you and your family during your recent travels to San Diego! We hope you had the chance to enjoy some of the sights and attractions our city has to offer. Your encouraging words to our friendly staff members will be shared with the team to ensure they receive your recognition. Thank you for choosing our conveniently located accommodations for your stay and for taking the time to let us know how we are doing. It saddens us to know anything was less than perfect and you experienced some high noise levels. During your next visit to the area, we hope to be given the chance to better accommodate you and ensure you receive the restful night you deserve. Once again, thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego.",Good
"I got the room, view and bed I requested for my family of three. We had a beautiful view of the harbor but I was a little bit bummed I couldn't see downtown due to a stairwell blocking that view. We were on the fifth floor though and had a view of the pool which was helpful when our 15 year old son went swimming and I was able to call down to him when I had a question for him. Our son came with us at the last minute so we had to add on a rollaway bed and that caused no problem at all. We left the hotel, shortly after checking in and when we returned, the bed was there. The room and rest of the hotel was clean and inviting. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was hot when we first arrived but the air conditioner worked perfect and cooled it down in little time. Our son used the pool and swam alone (for the first time in his life) for the entire time he was there. The pool temp and condition was perfect and he said it was nice and he really liked it. Even though the hotel was sold out, we never felt like it was crowded and never heard our neighbors. We also found parking in the covered lot on both nights we arrived back late. The breakfast was just ok. It is a continental breakfast though so in that vein, it was normal. However, it was very clean in the room and pleasantly decorated and arranged. They had a separate dining area for overflow or if you didn't want to be in the room with the food prep and television. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a wonderful stay here and I'd definitely return to the same location to stay overnight again. The highlight was walking out onto our balcony, on the last morning we were there (on a Sunday), to the view of the harbor with The Star Spangled Banner playing on speakers nearby, just loud enough for me to get misty-eyed. Beautiful moment.",Good
"I'm sure many people bill Hyatt House downtown as a hip, penthouse style apt, where you can go out and see what makes Seattle great, and it is. From my window on the 8th floor, you can overlook the Space Needle, museums below, giant artwork molds and the bustle of a city come alive with fun!For me though, it was all about winding down from a 13-week stint from my company, and meeting a friend, to start an adventure down the coast. I relished that I could bring up delicious sandwiches from the downstairs eatery, or go up on the rooftop and just hang out. I loved the view of the bay from my loft style suite, while reading a book. I liked curling up in their oh so comfy bed, with their plush pillows that were perfectly for resting and rejuvenating a weary soul.Mostly, I loved the fact that I could just be. And I think that is the point of Hyatt House. You make it what you want it. And its oh so easy to do that...Dear SBTimeTraveler,Thank you very much for taking the time to write a review of our hotel and your stay here at the Hyatt house Seattle. We very much appreciate all the feedback we get.

"I had to drive down from northern CA for Sunday business. I left later on Saturday evening and I knew I would have a late check in so I called and let them know. When I arrived at 12:47 AM,Crystal(I think that was her name,I was tired) at the desk said my name as if she was expecting me I had called 5 hours earlier and spoke with someone else!She checked me right in and I was in my room on 2nd floor by 1:00 AM. This is my second time staying here. I like the location as it is close to the fwy's that I need to access that lead me to three different locations to where I needed to be. All areas of destinations were within 15 minutes of this Best Western, which to me is most important for what I do. I was just saying to my wife that I would stay here again with her and kids if we came in for fun. Mind you, it is not a beach resort location, but if you are in San Diego for multiple activities, I would recommend staying here. Parking has been good and I don't find myself constantly looking out the window to check on my vehicle. No squirrely people lurking throughout Hotel. I travel often on weekends, and it seems sometime Motels/Hotels can be party spots...not here, quiet on my last two visits.I come down to San Diego at least 3 times a year for business and will continue to stay at this Best Western in the future.FYI, They have coffee all night!

"I'll start with saying this review is of The Pearl as venue, not just a hotel. I am very familiar with the property, as I live nearby, and stop in for a drink or dinner frequently. Point Loma is an often undiscovered part of San Diego, especially by tourists. Those in the know understand that some of our cities best gems are located on the peninsula, one of which is The Pearl. I recently hosted my company's holiday party here, and it was fantastic. It all starts with the venue, The Pearl surprises people because from the street most people have no idea what lies inside. Inside you'll find a lovingly restored motor lodge that brings back the spirit of 60's mid-century modern with some modern polish. That is complemented by a great bar and restaurant where you can find great cocktails, and unique food served by staff who are truly invested in what they do.I'll be the first to say that I prefer hotels, restaurants, and bars that have a point of view, and that are sometimes a bit quirky. If that's what you are looking for check out The Pearl.Thanks for acknowledging the Pearl for the great venue that it is, plus Point Loma!!!. is a great community. sometimes tourist overlook it, but it has lots and lots to offer. Hope you will come again soon. Tell a Friend.",Good

"IntroductionAs I looked out over Interstate 5 from my hotel room during rush hour, I felt somewhat justified in heeding the advice of more than a few Seattleites, who warned of the citys congested roadways, and voted in favor of its public transit alternatives. Allow me to draw the curtains, however, because this isnt about the sights and sounds of Seattle (lovely though it was), but of the Springhill Suites, Marriotts 3-star offering located at 1800 Yale Avenue.ItineraryThe original plan was to take the link light rail from SeaTac airport all the way to Westlake Station, where I could then walk to my hotel of choice, the Westin. Since I had 50,000 Marriott Rewards points to spend, and would rather graduate to a 4-star hotel later in the week, I slightly altered the itinerary. After arriving and walking to the Westin, I found a taxi out front that whisked us (my girlfriend and I) nine blocks or so to the Springhill Suites. I believe the total cost of that trip was 7, including a tip. This was a somewhat nerve racking experience, as I wasnt sure how we would get to the hotel up until that point. More on that later.Lobby and Front DeskUpon entering the lobby, there were a few things to note. First and foremost the friendly staff, who provided room keys and a voucher for a complimentary item from their snack bar (or 200 Marriott Rewards points), all while addressing me with a proper title and a smile. I know its their job, but Im a sucker for hearing my last name preceded by Mr.. The complimentary snack may have been a result of my status with Marriott (due to the points or my Marriott Rewards credit card). On the way to the elevators I glanced over at the bar/restaurant (appropriately titled Bistro on Yale Bar) and examined a lively scene of music and people that seemed to reflect the younger culture of Seattle. What I mean is that a large portion of the people I encountered throughout the city were either younger or around my age (Im 27 at the time of this review). Room Location and ViewThe view was nice, and about what I would expect from a 3-star hotel. It was located on the 8th floor, and Im not sure if this was to satisfy some preferred floor requisite in accordance with my entry level membership status. If so, it seemed strange that I was located next to the elevator and on the side without the coveted view of the space needle (like Id seen advertised). I wonder if Gold or Platinum status is necessary to net these luxuries without question, or a simple request to the front desk accompanied by 20. My view looked down on the 1811 Eastlake Avenue housing project, but also included the REI building, another building that displayed the time and temperature (very helpful when dressing), and the freeway. The first of these was the most interesting, where I viewed two men casually smoking marijuana on the back patio (kind of a site when youre from one of the 46 contiguous states that have not legalized it).Room AmenitiesThe room itself appeared well kept and clean on entry. The peripheral furniture included a couch that turned into a fold-out, and a chair both were on the lower end of comfortable, but I wasnt expecting Hancock and Moore. As advertised, the room also included a mini refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and sink all the basics for an extended stay. They even threw in a few packets of tea and coffee (including decaf). Across from the kitchenette, and probably my favorite part of the whole room, was the office area. The desk was roomy enough to accommodate my laptop, power adapter, a few snacks, and the host of other things that had accumulated in my pockets throughout the day. The power socket on the lamp was also a simple yet appreciated feature. The best part, and the reason Ive wallowed on the office area this long, was the chair. I found myself able to sit for at least forty-five minutes comfortably. I wish I could say the same for the bed, which was a little too firm for my taste. After 8.5 hours of searching for the perfect position, the first morning was a little hazy. This restlessness wasnt limited to sleep, but also occurred while keeping my head at an 11:00 position to watch the televisionoddly situated in the space between the living area and bedroom. I see why they had to put it there, as the wall that led into the bedroom slanted inward into the bathroom area, but it still makes you wonder why the room was built this way. Speaking of, the toilet and shower were in a room across from the mirror and sink. A little peculiar, but both areas were clean. The hotel was also kind enough to purchase swiveling televisions (plasma, 32-inch) to partially accommodate for the strange viewing angles. As I collapsed on to the fold out (yes, the fold out) after my first full day of touring, I questioned whether the floors consistency would be preferable to the charismatic springs in my back. Surprisingly, I slept better on this coiled chassis than the real bed. I can only assume it was due to the quality of the comforter (dense and fluffy), my exhaustion from the night before, and the vast amount of walking that took place earlier in the day. Local AreaYou know the saying about real estate, and so does Marriott. Though 1800 Yale Avenue isnt in the heart of the city, the area in which its built has a distinct urban vibe that still offers plenty of comfort. I like convenience while traveling, so seeing a Subway across the street was a welcome assurance after a half-day spent walking around Microsofts campus. I did frequent this establishment more than once, but lest anyone accuse me of not absorbing the local food culture, I assure there was an undeniable flavor about the stores setup that merited multiple visits. The main eating area was quite large, to the point you could probably fit three to four regular-sized Subways in the space. There was also a hallway connecting this area to another equally-sized one (minus the ordering counter). Seating options varied from booths to round-tables (think Starbucks) and stool-tables. Also impressive was the lit fireplace near the round table I selected, which actually kept me warm. Come to find out, this space had been renovated by the owner to accommodate a local online retailer who would be occupying a number of floors above it in the future (you know them as Amazon). There was also a 24-Hour Fitness next door to Subway (and still across the street from the hotel). Nothing special there, except the complimentary guest access in addition to Springhill Suites own, smaller fitness room. This included the weight room and cardio areas, as well as the locker rooms and associated amenities. If weights or cardio arent your thing, the pool, sauna or steam room may still be worth checking out. The ShuttleBesides a room, what else did the Springhill Suites have to offer Did someone say free shuttle! But to whereand when I learned the answer to these two questions the hard way as I stood outside of Nordstroms after arriving at Westlake Center, overwhelmed by the incredible fall weather (central Texas gave up on the concept years ago). As much as I wanted to see Marriotts safe insignia whirl around the corner and transport me free of charge, the hotel representative I spoke with informed that the bus only ran until 9:00 PM. We had arrived at Westlake around 9:45, so we strolled among the yellowed leaves to the Westin for a taxi. **fast forward to the day of checkout** I glanced down from my window at the back alley, where I spotted the shuttle bus with its hood open. The driver was pouring fluid into one of the tanks, but I couldnt make out which fluid or tank. I consulted the front desk thirty minutes later to redeem a free shuttle ride back to Westlake Center, but was informed the bus was undergoing an oil change. I looked out the back window again to discover the hood had been closed and the driver had vanished. They called me a cab instead, and offered to refund the fare. I guess what Im trying to say is, I have no idea what the shuttle is like! All I can say is it exists, and it travels to Westlake Center and Seattle Center (according to the front desk patron). Food and DrinkOne of the sweeter alternative rock bands said, Some people drink Pepsi, some people drink Coke. In this hotel the assumption is the former, and you will find their vending machines on most floors (I checked while looking for a working ice machine), as well as at the front snack bar. This drove my girlfriend nuts since she avidly consumes Diet Coke, and contributed to the aforementioned Subway visits. Im not sure if the the bar or breakfast area had alternatives, because I never went or had orange juice, respectively. Speaking of juice, the continental breakfast included eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, cereal, fruit, and an assortment of pastries. It was all pretty standard, and while Im not versed in the culinary arts, I would rate the Hampton Inn or Embassy Suites a notch higher in quality. Still, free breakfast works for me! Business CenterLets delve into whats often thought of as the lobbys forgotten extension. This is the place that excites me most, partly because of my selected profession (IT), and partly because of my general curiosity about how its handled. Before I get too entrenched, Id like to note that the wireless network in my room was open and unencrypted. A few questions entered my mind about thislike what would stop anyone in the area from leeching off the networkor anyone with a little technical sense from stirring up mischief (and by mischief I mean remotely browsing through your stuff) The possibilities are truly endless, and I would be remiss if I didnt urge you to get your digital house in order before connecting to this network (or any others like it).We can start with a basic question, something along the lines of What does the business center offer Well, there are two desktop computers and a printer, so you could check-in for your flight or print your boarding pass. Maybe you need to print out tickets for a local attraction or event. In some cases, you might even need to make an emergency purchase (pizza delivery if Subway is closed). That last situation brings up another questionthe one about feeling safe enough to enter your credit card number. While I did perform an extensive preliminary analysis to determine if vulnerabilities existed, the thing that probably concerns you most is the safety of your information. It should be stated that information is never 100 private, and with enough ingenuity and time anyone can probably get to it (obvious lecture concluded). Lucky for us, most people looking for a free lunch just dont want to work that hard. For those few criminal masterminds, however, dont make it easy!To give a brief overview, I was able to turn on cached internet files, history, auto-fill, and form data in Internet Explorer and Firefox. While there was a program for detecting spyware (Spybot), there was no antivirus program present. I was also able to successfully boot from a live USB, which can potentially undermine many of the security measures put in place by Windows 7 (their OS of choice). On the plus side the firewall was on, the user account was not an administrator by default, and a program called Deep Freeze was installedwhich presumably removes all cached files between sessions. While some of these measures are good, it only takes one gaping hole to gain complete control of a machine. If there were a bottom line, it would be that personal or financial usage of these machines could make it easy.Fitness CenterNot too far down the hall exists the hotels own fitness center and swimming pool. I cant say much for the pool or hot tub since I didnt use them, but the fitness center contained two decent LifeFitness treadmills, one bike, one elliptical machine, and some free dumbbell weights. If the hustle and bustle (and meatheads) of the gym are too much for you, this modest area could be the perfect retreat to satisfy your cardiovascular or weight lifting needs. I would also like to note that right outside the fitness center is the nicest mens bathroom in the whole hotel. I said mens bathroom! I wont go into detail, but at this rate I imagine the womens restroom is actually a spa.Cleaning ServiceBefore leaving the Springhill Suites to downtown Seattles friendly, urban borders, lets talk about one last thing. While coming and going throughout our stay the staff were extremely pleasant, from the front desk clerks to the breakfast chefs. Even the maid was polite and cheery, something I found amazing. One strange thing, however, was that for the entire two-night stay no one cleaned our room. Im aware that some hotels offer a green option, where you choose not to have someone come in and clean in exchange for something like rewards points. To my knowledge this is not one of those hotels. We did hang a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, but removed it when we left each morning. It wasnt a huge deal (as were relatively clean people), but I imagine this could be an issue for say, a family of four with kids.ConclusionOverall I enjoyed my stay at the Springhill Suites, and would probably return if looking for a decent, 3-star hotel in one of Seattles interesting pockets.

As for the fitness center, I apologize that it wasn't quite big enough for you. As you mentioned, we have discounted passes to a local gym. However, space is tight, so we're limited in our ability to expand it. If there's anything else we can do to make your next experience a five-star one, please don't hesitate to reach out.

"This hotel is absolutely perfect. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed. The staff was friendly, greeting me with a tour of the grounds, a description of the neighborhood, and escorting me to my room. The grounds and the room were lovely, exactly as advertised on the website. I stayed in the ocean view studio, which was beautiful, with a gorgeous view of the ocean. The room and the whole hotel is comfortable and relaxing and the perfect getaway.Greetings Sara T, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. On behalf of the the team, we are all so pleased that you had a perfect stay with us. We all strive to ensure that our guests have an enjoyable experience.

From the amazing warm staff , the beautiful suite with refrigerator, microwave, couch lounge area and two queen beds wow so well done!

"This is a wonderful bed breakfast in the heart of Boston. Location couldn't be more perfect, and the rooms are great. The decor is rather traditional, so don't come here if you're looking for chic and modern! You also won't get a TV, but you will get an over sized room (the double rooms are big, single rooms, not as much), with tall ceilings, beautiful furniture, a great bathroom and a nice comfortable bed. If you do get a single room, you'll have a shared bathroom.

I wanted to put in a review to give credit to a wonderful employee that came to our rescue during our stay :-).My family and I stayed at the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport this past weekend. The suite was beautiful! My 4 year old girls enjoyed playing house with the divider doors between the bedroom and sitting/living room. Unfortunately while they were playing they lock themselves in the room and my husband and I were unable to open the doors. While my girls were screaming in terror (thinking they were stuck forever) my husband called the front desk for help. Within 60 seconds Carlos Vecco (a maintenance worker) was knocking at our door. Carlos advised that the doors do not lock and we just had to give them a good tug. (Shame on my husband and I for not giving them a good pull). But we are so thankful for Carlos coming up so quickly! We thanked him for his assistance and said goodbye. In about 5 minutes Carlos returned with a beautiful courtesy package of treats for my girls. What a sweet man! Thank you Carlos! We appreciate everything you did! I hope somebody from Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport reads this and gives you the credit you deserve!!We truly appreciate you taking the time to write such a wonderful review and it was a pleasure to share your kind words with Carlos!

"Everything was clean, fairly updated, nice. The hotel was easy to get to from 75 and 285. We had a small couch, microwave, and mini fridge. We used the iron, safe, and hair dryer all without hiccups. The king bed in our room was so comfortable- I think memory foam, maybe And the pillows were not just big hard marshmallows but able to be fluffed and shaped a little. Breakfast was decent- scrambled eggs, sausage links, waffles, juice, coffee, cereal, fruit, yogurt, bread and bagels. Our only complaint was that the road noise from 285 was quite noticeable. We had a 4th floor room in the back, on the same end of the building as the pool. I think it would have been even louder on the front of the building though! Also when people flushed their toilets in other rooms, we could hear them. Didn't hear anyone's TVs or voices through the walls. Not sure if that's a function of the hotel or its guests that night though. We would stay here again, but maybe bring ear plugs, or request a different room, or try to run the fan on the heat/ac unit to provide some white noise.Thank you for taking the time to post comments on Trip Advisor about our location.

The location of this hotel can not be beat. The view is perfect and it's within easy walking distance of a million things to do.

"Enjoyed a 3-night stay as part of a 6-night trip to La Jolla. The valet team greets you upon arrival with a smile and a cold bottle of water. They also assisted me with my luggage and were incredibly friendly and helpful with pointing out the hotel restaurants and amenities along the way to my room. The grounds are incredibly gorgeous- flowers, succulents, and greenery galore! While the property is quite spread out, I found that getting from my room to the other side of the property never took more than 3-5 minutes. The room was spotless and the pillows and bedding were far superior to even my own at home! I can't tell you what a comfortable night's sleep I had! The spa is small but tranquil with a friendly, helpful staff. The pricing for services was actually pretty reasonable compared to many hotel spas- a 50 minute massage starts at 115. The property is not in walking distance to beaches or shops, so be sure to rent a car if you choose to stay at this property.

"We had stayed here before in 2012 and enjoyed it therefore we had great expectations for our return visit. We were disappointed. The staff were rude at check in and at all other times - no smiles or good mornings/afternoons were offered with one exception, James, who was really nice. The hotel itself appears outdated - there was a musty smell in the corridors and it felt unclean. Our first room was unacceptable as it was covered in dust, the carpet was really dirty, the bed sheets were pulled and tatty, and there were stains on the tiles in the bathroom (not small ones but large off-putting ones). We asked to switch rooms and while our second room was acceptable the carpet was in need of a good clean and we had no curtains - only a black out blind. We did not enjoy our second stay here - so much in fact we booked another hotel after the second night and only returned the night before heading home. We will not be staying here again, the great location does not make up for its shortcomings.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us, we do apologize that your stay did not meet expectations and want you to know that we will take your comments into consideration as we continually strive for improvement.Rafael Ortiz-MartinezFront Office Manager",Bad
"Thanks to American Airlines I found myself stranded in the Windy City for one night. First a faulty door, then poor weather and then returning to the gate to refuel (surely they should have thought about that one). Either way I wasn't going home, but heading straight for the Marriott O'Hare in Chicago, which, while on one level, not a great thing, on another, it meant I could mooch around Chicago for the day, which I did.The Marriott O'Hare was very much in the corporate mould, the sort of place where I find air hostesses normally Asian checking in ahead of me and sure enough there they were, but the check-in procedure was remarkably smooth and helpful. However, finding the room and then finding my way from the room back to the front desk area was tricky at one stage I was lost in a maze of corridors and had to retrace my steps back to the room and then start again, taking a right turn instead of a left. But this was a minor problem in the scheme of things.The hotel room was very nice. Too many pillows on the bed, but then all Marriotts seem to suffer from that affliction. There was WiFi, but it wasn't free which I always find a diabolical liberty and, oddly, it's always the big chain hotels that request payment, the ones that, arguably, don't need the money. Smaller hotels seem to offer it for free and, let's face it, the Marriott could too, but it chooses to charge. It was all academic to me as the airline had checked in my bag, which contained my laptop, so I only had the business centre on the ground floor, which I would use the following day. In fact, on the subject of the business centre, it was fine and they allowed me to use it AFTER I had checked out, which was kind of them, so I did get my free WiFi after all. Extend free internet access to the rooms and you'd get a 'very good' rating from me.It was late or getting late by the time I reached the lobby and took a seat for dinner, although only a limited menu was available to me. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and the fish dish and it was fine. Breakfast the following morning was excellent they had everything and it was all top quality. I ordered fresh fruit and some bread plus a bowl of cereal (something like Alpen) along with a pot of tea. But once again, where the tea was concerned, I remembered that if I fancied a decent cuppa I would have to wait until I reached England. There's never a pot of tea in the USA, but there's more likely to be a pot of hot water and a teabag in a sachet and that was the offering at the Marriott. But again, not a major worry.There was a shuttle bus to the airport and, after mooching around Chicago (definitely not my kinda town) I'd driven back to the Marriott in a taxi (having taken the CTA into downtown from Cumberland, a station across the parking lot from the hotel) and sat at the bar with a glass of Cabernet awaiting the call from the shuttle driver. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes and takes about 20 minutes to reach the airport.I'm one of those people who tend not to like the corporate hotels, but then, everytime I find myself in a Marriott or a Hyatt, I have nothing but praise for them perhaps I do like corporate hotels and that 'brand reassurance' they offer. I could have done with another night at the Marriott O'Hare and, preferably, under calmer circumstances. Marriotts are good hotels. I liked the Cleveland Marriott and the one in Atlanta and I'll forgive them leaving too many pillows on the beds. Keep up the good work.Mr. Moggridge! Thank you for writing about your stay! I thoroughly enjoyed your writing and thank you for the positive comments. As well as noting what we could improve on. I hope this note finds you at your destination. Wishing you safe travels and a pleasant summer. Dieter Heigl",Good
"Like other Hampton Inns that I have stayed in, this hotel did not disappoint. The room and bathroom were clean (as it should be). The room had a nice decor. We stayed here to go to a New Year's Eve part at the Westin, and it was within a very short driving distance from it and other nice little restaurants. They had continental breakfast, which is always nice, unfortunately the waffle maker was broken (that's why I didn't give it an excellent rating!) I would definitely recommend this hotel to others who need a hotel in the area.",Good

"We had booked a multi-centre holiday and needed to book at least one night in a hotel for the best airfare - so we decided that we would book this hotel as part of our overall package. It had been a long journey, London to New York then change planes for the trip to New Orleans. When we arrived we were both hot and tired and as there was no bar in the hotel we felt a bit let down. We were told there was a complimentary continental breakfast delivered to our room. We had no great expectation for that either.HOW WRONG CAN ONE BEAs it turned out, the breakfast was excellent. We have holidayed in France many times and the croissants were as good as any we have had in France. The orange juice was also excellent. They have an outside patio area and we were told we could order breakfast to be delivered there - which we did every subsequent day. A great start to the morning.The hotel is really well located for the French Quarter - an easy walk in the evening.The staff on reception were really helpful and friendly and offered a lot of help in terms of getting around and parking our car - when we had collected our hire car after a few days.I am sure there may be flashier and more expensive hotels in New Orleans, but if I were to return I would have no hesitation in returning to the St James Hotel.",Good

It is nice to know how well our location worked for your trip... we hope you had a fantastic time in San Diego!",Good
"We enjoyed our stay here at the start of August. The room was spacious and had nice modern touches like lots of USB charging points, fast wifi, docking stations and the likes. The fridge was also useful. I'd definitely stay here again.The only downside was that our room was directly opposite the elevator. It pings twice every time the doors open which is extremely irritating when trying to sleep. (Of course, there is no option to take the stairs, it's lift or nothing, so it's in use all the time.) The hotel were happy to move us to another room which was near a lift that was out of order. Sadly it started working on one of the mornings so we still got disturbed. It wouldn't out me off staying here though.It's close to Fisherman's Wharf which may or may not suit. Accessible from SFO by BART and then on to F-line. We took an Uber back to SFO though and it only cost 10 more for two of us. Much easier.",Good
"We had a fantastic stay in Chicago at the Comfort Suites. Right in the heart of the city, easy access to everything! I really enjoyed the space the room afforded (there were four of us) and the hot breakfast was an added bonus. The staff was very friendly - when we needed some extra supplies for the kitchen they were brought to our room very quickly. This is an awesome hotel.I am so happy you had a fantastic stay and that you found our staff helpful and accomodating. I too love our views. We would love to welcome you back next time you are in Chicago. Thank you!",Good

"The overall experience of staying 2 nights at the hotel was pleasant. Loved the location next to Old Town and the fact once we parked we never had to use our car until check out. A huge plus for my travel party. The shuttle driver was so nice and courteous and punctual. the room was ok as our room view was not what we desired.. I wanted a view of the city/ or bay, instead it was inside the courtyard. But beds and and room was decent. Breakfast was good served at the restaurant, that had a variety of offerings for all. The complaint I have was the Hot Tub, which was luke warm. We were very disappointed at the lack of heat of the spa. That was supposed to be relaxing and refreshing, instead it was like murky coldish bath water. I so wanted to love the hotel for future stays...Greetings, and thank you for your feedback. Im glad to hear that you found our location convenient, room comfortable and shuttle driver friendly. My apologies for the hot tub. Were looking into what might have been the problem! Before your next visit, please call the front desk directly to explore all room location options. We want you to have the views you desire. Youll also get the best rates we offer. Thank you again for staying with us! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager",Good
"The Galleria Park has become my downtown hotel when attending conferences at Moscone Center. It's a lot more relaxing and personal than the bad-service-mega-Marriott or other downtown choices. Being on the 'other' side of Market means you discard all (well almost all) the other conference go-ers, giving yourself a break from the noise and crowd. The hotel is small and quiet and the staff is excellent, going out of their way to make you feel welcome. Coffee and wine are served complementary in the morning and early evening (respectively). I have just two small issues which prevented this review from being an EXCELLENT. First, our room was REALLY small this time the bathroom sink was in the bedroom, and the shower was so tiny my husband couldn't really fit in it. Previously, my rooms have been somewhat larger. Second, the staff was unable to give me a good restaurant recommendation for dim sum... I know I can't expect the front desk to replace a concierge, but this seems like a pretty common request. But otherwise, the stay was great and I will do it again!Dear Janae L,Thank you for the lovely review of our property. We are so proud to be your go-to downtown SF hotel when attending conferences. We're glad to know you find our atmosphere to be more relaxing and personal than the stereotypical conference hotels. We also love the compliments of the team as we aim to deliver service that is friendly yet professional for every guest who walks through our doors. I do apologize regarding the lack of dim sum restaurant recommendations - be sure to hunt me down next time... I've got a few places in mind! We hope to see you again for the next convention!Best,Jordan Whitney",Good
"Hotel staff was wonderful from start to finish in the midst of snowstorm in February. SO helpful and friendly. Many stayed overnight to make sure hotel was staffed next day. And although hotel does not have restaurant (by design), when the only restaurant within walking distance was closed, the staff brought in food and offered to share with me. Through it all, they had great attitudes and made a miserable situation bearable.Hello!We sincerely appreciate your feedback. We continue to focus on providing outstanding service and ensuring our guest are taken care of despite of the ongoing weather issues. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful comments.

"I have been staying at Estancia for over 10 years and it is a lovely property in a quiet, but central location in La Jolla, near San Diego, around many beautiful beaches and golf courses. The hotel offers nice, manicured gardens, comfortable rooms, a Spa, excercise room, swimming pool, and two restaurants and bars. The beakfast buffet is quite good. The service is helpful and the hotel has valet parking. The guys that park your car are very friendly and helpful with directions and general information. It is a beautiful hotel, but it is not luxurious! Don't expect the 4 Seasons! My tip is to buy a package including breakfast and car parking. Although the price goes up, there is no unpleasant surprises at check out and you can order whatever you want for breakfast without worrying about the cost. The hotel is a lovely location for weddings and there are always several taking place on the weekends. Thank you so much for the review and for staying with us for nearly ten years! It sounds like you enjoyed nearly all of our amenities during your recent trip. We are happy to hear that one of your favorites is the breakfast buffet. Great tip on going with a package! We hope to see you again soon!",Good
"I visited this hotel as a weekend stay-cation and I was wonderfully pleased with my choice. This hotel is boutique-like, and I felt welcome and comfortable from the moment I walked in. The lobby is beautiful, and the door staff and front desk person were warm and friendly. The little courtyards are a beautiful spot to sit with a glass of wine or coffee and enjoy the vibe of New Orleans.Check-in was smooth, and about :15 after I arrived in my room I received a text from the from desk making sure everyone was satisfactory. It was. The room was clean, large and comfortable. The bed was a good mix between firm and soft. Every morning they deliver coffee, juice, tea and freshly baked croissants to your room. It was a great way to start each morning before going out exploring.The location is very centralized but nice and quiet. I parked my car and didn't touch it again until it was time to leave. The hotel is about a few minute walk to the French Quarter and CBD, which both have a great selection of restaurants, activities and I highly recommend finding a spot to just sit back and people watch.Parking like most places in this area is high, I paid 30 a night parking myself, which was about 9-10 cheaper than valet. There is a self-service parking lot IMMEDIATELY across the street so it didn't put me out at all to park my own car.All in all, my stay was incredible and I highly recommend. Thank you St. James hotel for a wonderful stay.You're more than welcome, and thank you for taking the time to leave a review!You made a great choice choosing us for your stay-cation. Because we're a smaller boutique hotel, everything here is a little more warm, friendly, and charming. We are glad you had a great experience with our staff and enjoyed the room, complimentary breakfast, and central location. We very much hope to see you again the next time you have a stay-cation in New Orleans!Sincerely,Duriel HarrisGuest Service LiaisonSt. James Hotel(504) 304-4000",Good
"This was my first time staying here. My great experience started a few months before the stay when I booked the room online using AirMiles. After receiving my confirmation from AirMiles I realized I had been put in a smoking room (I didn't have the option to pick). I called the hotel right away to see if they could change me to a non-smoking one. Even though it wasn't their fault/issue, the gentleman who helped me was able to move me no problem. The team at the front desk was very helpful throughout the stay. The shuttle from the airport and to the cruise terminal was very handy. They even arranged for a taxi to pick me to take me to the zoo for an early morning tour. The breakfast was pretty limited options wise, but the service was decent. Overall the room was quite loud with traffic and construction noise, but the bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and clean.",Good
"I want to comment on the outstanding service I received from Lindsey. The zipper on my motorcycle boots had broken, and Lindsey found some duct tape with which to secure my boots.

"The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was above average with fruit and yogurts. Staff were very friendly and helpful genuine interest in their guests, location is great with Tram stop very close direct to City Centre. Safe and gated parking area amazed me. Another thing about the location, St Charles Street is very wide with green space (for the trolley), trees, and historical homes in a nice neighborhood. I will definitely book this place again.We appreciate your review and business greatly! Hope to have you stay with us again.",Good
"a very average place to stay, but I am a very budget conscious traveler and and dont mind to save on a hotel to spend in other places, such as shopping at nearby downtown San Francisco!With in walking distance from Union Square and all the attractions restaurants and night lifethe city has to offer. NO WIFI in the rooms",Neutral
"I always rely on TA before booking a hotel but I didn't on this hotel - that was a huge mistake.The location of the hotel was convenient to all locations we wanted to visit but the place needs to be torn down and rebuilt. It is old, dingy, and dark. The room was very dated and had a very dark appearance although there was a front window. The outside walkway, as mentioned by another traveler, is slanted and uneven. The elevator is scary. The breakfast room looks like it used to be a sleeping room and is very dated and dark. The food is typical continental breakfast food. Overall, I would say spend more money and stay somewhere else.Good Morning,Thank you for sharing your review regarding your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. I sincerely appreciate your compliments to our location, just within minutes to most attractions here in San Diego. I apologize for the outside look of our property. Unfortunately, the property next door to ours was just demolished, giving our area a run-down look. We are anticipating construction for the new businesses there within the next year hopefully this will improve the feel of our property.I hope you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.

Access to this hotel is easy as it is just off the freeway. The lobby and the rooms are clean and tastefully furnished. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast is excellent and there are many items to choose from. A great stay overall.,Good
"I made my reservations nearly a year ago because I knew the holiday weekend was going to be booked crazy. Atlanta on the Labor day weekend is always crazy. There's Dragon*Con with a record of 57,000 people in attendance this year (2013) and then all the major opening season games (Alabama vs VT) so getting an early booking is a must.I drove in from Alabama and got a room with 2 doubles in it for about 177 (with tax) a night. Not terrible considering the location. It's right down town next to the major Dragon*Con hotels and located close to all of the nice restaurants (Max Lager Brew Pub, Fire of Brazil, etc).As for the actual hotel though I was a little disappointed. I understand that a Motel 6 isn't supposed to have the quality of a Marriot, or a Hyatt, or a Hilton, but it was just sort of lacking this year.The building itself is from the late 70s early 80s (based on the floor plan, and the construction style). Security isn't really too bad. A guest must have their key to get access to the inner part of the hotel at all times. So just because you can walk in the front door, and even ride the old elevator, doesn't mean you can actually get to your door. This actually caused me a little problem because I ran out to my car for a moment leaving a friend and my key in the hotel room. When I went to get back in I couldn't even get through the door to access my hotel room door because you must have a keycard to enter any of the floors. Personally I understand it's my fault for leaving my key, and I'm glad for the extra layer of security. Just remember to ALWAYS have your keycard.Upon entering my room though it was another story. The room was approaching 85 degrees when we got there in the mid afternoon (3pm local). And smelled of old sour (VERY sour) towels. There was even a hint of cigarette smoke as well. Luckily we had to be somewhere else in hurry so we dropped our gear and headed out making sure the AC was blowing ice cold air (which is did ALL weekend! :) ).Upon returning the room had chilled down immensely and the smell had dissipated some. We found if we shut off the bathroom the smell dissipated so we deduced that the smell was coming from somewhere in the plumbing (it smelled like the drain to the bathtub specifically).The beds weren't great, but they offered a place to lay one's head. I woke up multiple times with a soar back in the morning, but nothing a little Aleve wouldn't knock out. There was no breakfast like in years past, but the manager and assistants were as helpful as they could be. My friend was in need of a hair dryer and they had one to borrow, no questions asked.The stay was uneventful, but do be careful. The small door hanger you set out on the handle to Not be Disturbed has 2 sides. My friend knew they were coming around and so placed it outside our door, only for the door to be knocked on twice. I thought it might be the housekeeping staff not reading the sign. But upon on inspection the placard actually has a Do Not Disturb side and a Housekeeping Please side. Morale of the story, make sure you select the right side!Check out was simple and easy and I will stay here again in the future mainly due to it's location.One of the things I value most about this hotel is it's free parking. Yes I said free. When many of the other hotels charge 20+ for a night or the local parking lots even more, it's nice to have a place you can drive in and out of without a problem. Mind you the manager takes this parking very seriously so place your hotel-given parking permit in your window or you run the risk of being towed (we saw this happen multiple times). Seriously, its not hard to put the piece of paper on your dashboard!So in closing will I stay here again Absolutely. Do I understand that it's an older building with some renovations that need to be done Yep. Do I enjoy the free parking, the location, and the fact it's relatively quiet and secure No question there.Pros: - FREE Parking- Quiet- SecureCons: - Older building- No Double Queen Rooms- Minimal Amenities",Neutral
"This was a beautiful hotel. All the things that made it a bank are still there, reminding you of the lovely banks that we used to have. The fact that part of the building is still an operating bank was a surprise. Everything was lovely. I did not eat in the restaurant because the rest of my party wanted to go other places , but we should have eaten there. We went to Mother's we had the worst meal that any of us ever had. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay its location.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and we appreciate the great review.

Though I came during an High School something of another I was worried that my stay here would be disturbed by noisey kids....WRONG! I slept like a baby...I missed breakfast however to avoid the traffic but other than that everything was wonderful. House Keeping went over and beyond with hospitality...someone was always at the desk smiling upon entering...it's very close to the main strip where resturants and the entertainment was. Needless to say I 3 this hotel!Thank you for your kind review. We are very happy you enjoyed your stay and look forward to welcoming you back!,Good

It does not have a microwave, but it did have a mini fridge. We would definitely stay here again. The staff was very friendly and always available for questions.",Good
"I've stayed here a couple times and each time it's been a spacious room at a reasonable price. The room I stayed had a living room kitchen combo room and then a separate room which contained the King bed and bathroom. TVs were in living room and bedroom which was nice. Living room had a pull-out sofa sleeper. Room was clean. Carpet is a bit out of date but definitely not gross by any means. Wifi worked fine. Pricci (restaurant) is directly across the street. Pricy but good. Waffle House is within 1/4 mile with sidewalks and crosswalks so you can get there very easily if desired. Looking forward to breakfast in the a.m. as it was pretty good the last time I was here. The hotel shuttle was quite busy around 4pm on a Wednesday so LaToya from Sales/Marketing came and picked me up from the Buckhead Marta Station. Talk about going above and beyond. Hello!!!

"Lovely decor, lots of wood, lots of plants. Very romantic. The hotel is extremely well kept and spotlessly clean.

This is a lovely hotel next to the Chicago River and two blocks from Michigan Ave. The staff were incredibly helpful. The room was not large but was very comfortable. We stayed in the Clubquarters section of the hotel. Snacks are provided during the day and each floor has a water station with chilled filtered water.,Good
"This hotel is run down. Pics are not as advertised. Very cheap furnishings. Thermostat didn't work along with elevators not working. If you want something equal to a run down super 8 but want to pay a more expensive price than that, then this is the hotel for you.",Neutral
"This was a pretty decent hotel for business travel. The room and bed was comfortable. The rooms are definitely small, but I didn't really spend much time in my room anyway. I didn't love that you have to go to a utility closet outside of your room to grab a ironing board and iron, but not a big deal -- kind of unique and boutiquey, I guess. This is definitely a unique hotel and modern hotel.The water pressure in the shower was really bad though, unfortunately. It took absolutely forever to rinse since there was nearly no water coming out -- not to mention the cold and uncomfortable feeling of being wet and cold without enough warm water rushing out. Why do so many hotels have water pressure issues This always drives me nuts -- it is so hit and miss too. One hotel will have great pressure in the city, and the next horrible.. I wish more reviewers spoke to water pressure haha. Or is that just me who cares about thatThe location is excellent -- right on the river and close by everything you need. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.I unfortunately got a room with no view so I cannot comment on the view, but I am sure the view would have been incredible from that location, if you had a river view. My window was quite small though, so not sure how they are on the other side of the building. Overall, if you're staying in Chicago, you will likely enjoy your stay at this hotel. It's basic and does the job. Very clean, modern and standard. One of the biggest things that determines my feelings on a hotel is the bathroom / shower experience.. its like make and break for me haha! So, unless they fix the water pressure issues, I likely won't be staying here again.Hello cformosa4,We truly appreciate your visit and thoughtful review. We are sorry to hear about the water pressure and will certainly have the room inspected and improved straight away.

"Myself, my partner and her father, stayed in a King Suite in March. The room itself was lovely- spacious, modern, funky looking room. The main bed was huge, and comfortable. There was also a pull down bed, which we used, which was again a decent size, and comfy. We also had a large table and chairs in the room- its surprising how nice it is to have somewhere to sit other than a bed whilst staying in a hotel,The location was perfect- very close to the Bart, and cablecars and Union square. A couple of nice diners very nearby for breakfast too. Would highly recommend, based on our stay. There was also 2 hours of free saki (5-7pm) everyday- we only tried this once, on our way out, but its still a nice touch to have.The only real downside, was that there was a lot of street noise, and it appeared to be an old hotel done out, but the windows were still the old orignal ones- so didnt keep much of the noise out at all- I would suggest taking earplugs! we were woken around 6am most mornings.",Good
"This is an excellent hotel in my mind, there are a lot of parking spots for use, you ALWAYS can find a spot for parking any time. great breakfast with apple or banana. hot tub and swimming pool make you a enjoyable stay, very clean in room.

"My wife and I are owners here - and while the GM was fantastic in trying to make our stay right - I really hope the Food and Beverage service poolside is improved before our return next year. We heard from many other couples around the pool that had the same concerns and even the management staff when we commented on it said they knew it was an issue and were working on it. Three different managers said this. That said - Chris (the GM) addressed our concern and was fantastic. The front desk staff, housekeeping and bell staff were also very good. Their service at the Westin North property pool side is much higher at this time and I hope and expect that Nanea will get there soon. When you are on vacation you tend to spend a lot of time at the pool and thus was poor service there really stands out. Thanks Aloha Scott S,Mahalo for your review and your gift of feedback. Our General Manager, Chris Rabang, is always willing to go above and beyond to assure that each and every one of our guests is well taken care of. His leadership is a prevailing factor in our property's enormous success, despite only being open for 7 months. With that being said, we do regret that our Food and Beverage service did not meet your expectations. We will diligently address this issue and continue to improve our service. We hope that you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations.A hui hou! (Until we meet again)",Neutral
"Staying at this hotel on business, every week I need my folio sent. 90 days later, the same person at the front desk Janelle, is a mean and nasty person. I have a dozen other co-workers staying here as well. She treats everyone poorly. We are tired of writing letters, and will all be finding other accomodations for December. You'd think after 3 months she would at least do the work. She thoroughly enjoys being difficult. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU NEED ANY ASSISTANCE. Sad how one person can soil an otherwise decent experience.Thank you for your feedback regarding your experience, and for speaking with me on the phone last week. We have a great staff and so the review certainly caught me by surprise.

The rooms, while dated, are great and comfortable.I would recommend it to anyone.Good Afternoon Karl and thank you for your very kind review! Please consider us your home away from home for business or pleasure. We hope to see you again soon in the near future, until then, safe travels!",Good
"Awesome stay all around the prices were greats compared to other similar hotels in area for quick last second booking for 3 nights. They allowed our small dogs to stay in a available suite for pets for a great nightly rate. Would highly recommend for simple clean room and good rates. I had accidently left my brand new 3 series apple iwatch in the room and I believed to had left it in the pull out couch bed and my family had forgot to look and checked out of the room already without the watch or looking. I thought it was gone for good. But good thing Sulema was servicing our room and was able to find the watch tucked away it was in sofa bed hidden. She is a life saver and very awesome I appreciate her returning my watch. It was a gift from somebody special to me and I use at work daily. Thanks million Sulema... (PS she also had our room nice and clean and restocked room supplies as needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Customer service was a 10 out of 10) Thank you.Dear jayvega89Thank you for your feedback regarding your stay at the Best Western San Diego Miramar. We are delighted you enjoyed your stay with us. We pride ourselves in being able to offer great pricing for our guest, even if it is a last minute booking. It is was our pleasure to be able host you and your pets at the hotel. Our hotel enjoys hosting our fury little friends after all they are part of the family.I am glad to hear that Sulema was able to provide a good service and was able to find that watch. It sounds like the Iwatch is priceless and I so happy to hear that we were able to find it and get it back to you. We hope to see you on a future stay.",Good
The Benson is an old historic hotel that is excellently kept up. The lobby is an amazing view into the past and the elegance the hotel maintains to this day.

"On a recent visit to Orlando, I stayed at the Hampton Inn next to Sea World. This Hampton Inn is on par with the chain. Good, clean rooms and friendly service.

"Warning:. Do not stay here if you have kids or simply don't mind having others watch you in your room through peepholes. Oct 13th to 16th stay. Peephole discovered above light, which is above sink in room 507. Sheriff's Dept. Notified at 830 am next morning. Staff didn't care and in fact smirked as though they didn't believe it. Corporate responded by email to my complaint stating that since credit card company agreed to reverse charges and police had been contacted, they weren't going to pursue matter, implying somehow that I shouldn't have told in them. Absolutely gross! You have been warned! Stay at own risk! I will update further once the police investigation has completed. Check out the pics of the room, 507.

"My husband and I stayed at the Sorrento the night before leaving on and after returning from a cruise. So we got to see the hotel on a Friday and Saturday night a week apart.The staff was wonderful. When we arrived, they got our name from the luggage tags and were already getting us checked in before we even came in the hotel. The concierge was helpful in arranging scheduling the complementary town car service to the pier and area restaurants for us, as well as the dock for our cruise departure. They also picked us up when we returned.The hotel restaurant was good, though not exceptional. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning and room service the other. Service was friendly.We were subject to a Sweet 16 party our 1st night in the hotel. We complained about the noise and when we returned for our 2nd night the next weekend, we were upgraded. We appreciated the gesture, however that weekend, a Bat Mitzvah was taking place. Also a very noisy occasion. So 2 young ladies enjoyed their big nights, while we did not.The hotel is lovely. The staff exceptional. Street noise is not a problem. Parties on the 7th floor - big problem. Great location - close enough to everything without being too close. The complementry car service is a big plus.",Good

"My partner and I booked this hotel expecting a high-end luxury experience. What we found was a rather worn and tattered, rock-n-roll hotel with a dated atmosphere. The room was clean, but again, a little worn. The service was okay, but our room was not ready when we arrived a bit early, but we were told it would not be ready for over an hour AFTER check-in time. We were able to check our bags at the desk, and we went for an early cocktail, but chose another place once we saw the kind of seedy bar. Room service was quick, but the food was just average. I have a feeling this outpost of the W brand is in for a major shakeup. The price of rooms here is high, and I just don't see why. We also stayed at the Hyatt Olive 8, and the experience was MUCH better. I would skip the W Seattle. You will not get what you pay for.Hello JJHappyTraveler, many thanks for your recent review on your stay at W Seattle. We apologize that we missed the mark with you and your partner.

"Nice hotel right on Bourbon Street in the heart of the French Quarter. Hotel offers rooms with a balcony so you can throw those beads! We stayed o the top floor in a room overlooking Bourbon, it was noisy all night. We were okay with that, and they provided earplugs. The bed was very comfy and the old building was beautiful.

"The hotel has been thoroughly modernized and is great and very fresh. The size of the rooms and bathrooms in the main hotel is great. We did not stay in the of the rooms out by the pool. There was a slight issue when checking in as we called in the morning and requested connecting rooms as we had a 3 adults and 2 four year olds and a two and a half year old. When we checked in we were taken to the 9th floor first and no connection then to the 10th floor and no connection and then down to the 3rd floor and found connecting there. Kyle the bell hop was great and stayed with us on the radio so we did not have to travel up and down with cart and kids. They handled it well and resolved it quickly. Kyle did an excellent job of taking care of us. The only thing I would say is questionable is the pool area in the indoor area floor. The floor is very slippery and dangerous and we were quite surprised when we were there that the hotel has not done something to change that after all the money they spent on the remodel.Also had a bit of trouble everytime we left parking lot with room keys and the parking kiosk. Took several times and a buzz to the inside to get the gate up. We were not the only ones, everyone we came across was having trouble exiting the hotel parking lot. Maybe they should come up with a new system. Laundry area was nice and very clean and bright. They may want to considering adding one more of each machine as they have only one now, but it was a large room with plenty of space and very clean. The restaurant breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff in the restaurant and bar area were very good.The business center was great with new computers and a great printer. Would definitely stay again.",Good

"Had a wonderful deluxe king on the 7th floor (room 709) in the back of the building so it was nice and quiet. (Remember that in downtown SF, any room in any hotel that faces the street will be loud and noisy due to the noise on the street--no hotel can guard against this.) The room decor was nice and modern with a dash of whimsy. Plenty of hangers in the closet plus a small safe for my iPad and other valuables. Fabulous slanted bar glasses in the room--I want to find them for my home. The bathroom was huge with a private WC. I loved the PURE bathroom amenities--will also need to shop for these for my home. Staff was very friendly. They are doing some remodeling but it never bothered me. It is targeted to be done in September 2016. Great location near Union Square and BART/MUNI stops. Starbucks is right next door as is a good upper-scale Mexican restaurant with a great bar.WOW! Thank you for sharing your 5 star Diva experience with us!

"Before booking this hotel I was already having anxiety reading all the negative reviews. Considering it was memorial day weekend and nearly everything was sold out we had no choice but to stay here. The location is prefect, right by the Tropicana, and a walking distance to Ceasers. The elevator is a bit sketchy, the halls smell a little funny but the room wasn't as bad as I expected. The bathroom needs some renovations, and bed sheets had a few stains on them but for the price and location on such a busy weekend was do-able. Take your own sheets and you'll be fine.",Good

Great location to French Quarter and Warehouse district. We arrived early yet they had a room available so we were able to check in. Keep in mind that these buildings date back to the early 1800's but that's what we love about them. The room was small but had exposed brick and wooden beams in the ceiling giving it all the more charm. It was exceptionally clean and the beds were very comfortable. Because of the age of the building we made an allowance that we had to unplug the TV in order to plug in the coffee pot. No big deal. We were concerned about noise but our 4th floor room face the courtyard and we heard little noise. The house staff did a great job on supplying fresh towels and keeping the room tidy.We're happy to hear you had a delightful stay with us at the French Market Inn! Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about our staff service and central French Quarter location. We hope to welcome you back to the Big Easy soon.,Good

"This hotel has a beautiful lobby, professional staff 5 star feel. However, the rooms are small with larger than needed furniture and bathrooms that are average. There are beautiful touches throughout the hotel, great sushi restaurant (from what we heard), but rooms their carpeting feel worn are in need of some space saving touches (like a built-in desk shelving) in order to feel really upscale. Add to that that it sits in the tenderloin district (filled with the cities homeless and drug dealers) it is definitely not a family friendly place to stay one many of you may not want to chose. We had a car, however traveled out of the city quite a bit. Otherwise, I would not plan to stay here and walk in the area, especially at night. Overall, it is a nice hotel. Room service food was way better than average the staff we encountered was the same, but you really don't see them unless you stop at the front desk or walk to the front doors. The extra fee's for everything: 16 wifi, 50+ for overnight parking, 20 gym fee 6 for in room water, made us feel like we were being milked and our agreed upon nightly rate turning into a never again experience. One positive note I'd like to add is that Starbucks is adjacent to the hotel, all you need do is open a hotel door you're there:)Hello MarrieinLove (I love your name!)-Thank you for taking the time to write a review.

This is a basic hotel at a basic price. Pillows were very small. Bathroom was behind self closing fire type door which made it awkward.

While my family and I were there, there was no room service because they were working on a restaurant. Too bad I won't be there when it's finished, but I can't say I'm not excited for it!

"the restaurant was overpriced and not very good. The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother, although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working.

"I loved my stay at the Springhill Suites in Seattle. I was in town from Fort Mohave, Arizona, visiting a friend. We stayed here, because it was basically in the middle of everything we were doing in 2 days. The staff was super friendly, the room was perfect, breakfast in the morning was great, and the shuttle service to the Space Needle was a nice plus. We got checked in by 11 am, which was great, because we had a day full of activities planned, and it was nice to get our stuff put away so we could enjoy ourselves. The price was very reasonable as well. I totally recommend staying here!!",Good

"Stayed two nights here with a friend and we were not disappointed. The rooms were large with high ceilings and exposed beams and brick. The bathroom was large with a huge walk in shower. Check in was easy and since we weren't leaving until later in the day after check out they gladly held our bags for us as we explored the city. The location of this hotel is amazing because it is right in the center of everything. You walk out the doors and you can walk anywhere you need to within a few minutes. The staff was so kind and friendly and offered help on places to visit. I know I'll be staying here again ! Ps the most comfortable beds I have slept on in all my travels !

"In many ways, this hotel is what you would expect from a remodeled urban hotel. Great location, strange room layouts, modern dcor. The room was very clean, and furnished nicely (just not as nicely as the room featured on the website). There were a few issues with my room, some which can be easily remedied, some that can not. First, the shower was poorly designed so whenever it is on water will splash on the floor. The guest across the hall from me requested a shower curtain. There are no built-in shower caddies for soap and shampoo but I found plastic ones with suction cups on the floor of the shower. I thought they had been left there, perhaps to dry after being sanitized. Several times I attempted to stick them on the wall of the shower, but every time they would fall, startling me. The deadbolt on my room door did not lock properly. Every evening the noise from the Mexican restaurant downstairs was very disruptive. It sounded almost like my bed was in the middle of the dining room. I can tune-out almost any noise, but my wife, who is a light sleeper, would've had a hard time getting to sleep. Bottom line, not worth the price.Thank you for taking the time to share this unfortunate experience with us. We are very sorry you did not enjoy your stay. I am not sure if you already reported these issues in regards to your deadbolt and shower caddie but if you have not, do you mind emailing me directly so I can retain your room number and get these items fixed We greatly appreciate you sharing this feedback with us as it allows us the opportunity to improve in the future.

"My wife and I spent one week here. Our studio suite (bed room/living room/kitchenette/bath)was comfortable, clean and quiet. The well-trained staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were fine, although some higher fiber cereal would be nice. We did not sample the free dinners (Monday to Thursday). We would happily stay here again and plan to recommend it to family and friends. A minor complaint: the internet was S-L-O-W and needed to be re-approved each day. It also appears to be very family friendly. We don't believe you will be disappointed.",Good

"I stayed here on a recent work trip. I didn't like the valet-only parking option. It took a long time in the morning to get the car, since there were a lot of people coming at the same time, and nobody was in a rush. C'mon folks, it's time for us to get to work, can't you do more than walk slowly to retrieve our cars for which we're paying 20/day for you to park in the big empty garage upstairs Anyhow, the lobby is beautiful at the hotel. My only gripe is that the restaurant has very few good tables because of the awkward design of the restaurant in the lobby. The bar is very pleasant and quite cool for a Hilton Garden Inn, and the bartender was very friendly. Front desk staff at the hotel were very friendly too. Room was modern, big, and clean. The gym was pretty good, though the TVs on the treadmills didn't get many good channels. Hopefully next time I'll stay here but just ride MARTA instead of suffering the cost of the parking. Overall, though, very sharp design, clean spaces, and friendly staff.",Good
"This was my third time staying here. I never have any real issues and the staff is friendly. They offer a shuttle. I will continue to make this my go to for events in the Buckhead area.

"We have stayed at The Whitney before, but had no idea that the hotel no longer had a bar nor restaurant. This is a sad commentary, since we enjoyed the hotel last year, and were looking forward to another visit. The staff was again cooperative, understanding, and friendly. But, the sink had only a trickle for water flow, and the engineer could not fix the problem. And, we were there for 5 ngts. I'm sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay. There were some service issues with the previous food and beverage operation, which was contracted through a 3rd party. Due to this, a change was made and the hotel has started offering a free continental breakfast. While we've received mostly positive feedback about the change, we understand that some like a full service restaurant inside the hotel. Plans to reopen the bar are underway and with all the wonderful dining options in walking distance of the Hotel, our Front Desk team will always have a great recommendation for you. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope you come back and see us next year. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager",Bad
"We stayed here five nights. Will stay again.The room was nice with a dinning area and small lounge with kitchen ( full size fridge, stove top, dish washer and pots and pans etc ) which helped as we bought so much food from the Pike Place Market. We have two queen beds with a sofa bed. Room was clean and bright, shower has high water pressure, beds were comfortable.The location is perfect to use the monorail. It is just less than 5 mins walk from the monorail station at Seattle centre. The hotel has a downtown shuttle within a one mile radius which include Pike Place Market but it is always very busy and require booking and often long wait.Breakfast was included it was pretty good for complimentary breakfast, with omelet station, fruit juice, pancake, fruits etc.The small things that make it not deserving of a perfect score was 1) the very poor wifi, 2) the breakfast was always busy with long queue and no seats 3) only two lifts for such a full capacity hotel hence long wait 4) staffs rarely ever smile and not very helpful - we asked for a shower cap and have had to call twice and went down to reception in person once before we finally get it and about one hour later. However we understand that it was because the hotel was very busy. The only staff who made us feel welcome and went out of his way to get a taxi for us was Wayne - thank you!",Good
"The location of the hotel is absolutely unbeatable. You'll be on Union Square within 3-5 minutes of walking distance. The front desk staff was so nice and we had nice little chats with them. The only thing I was a bit disappointed about, was the size (or lack of) of the room. We traveled with 2 big suitcases and struggled to find space for them. However if you are just staying for 2-3 nights on a city trip, this hotel is ideal and I would definitely stay again.Hi Celina93,Thank you so much for the positive review! We are glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. Perhaps next time we can book a larger room for you.

"I love everything about The Pearl Hotel and Restaurant! I booked the Essentials package, that came with free parking for your stay, two complimentary cocktails, and one appetizer. I stayed in Room 3 and everything was great! The bed was super comfortable and I had a wonderful nights sleep. The room comes with a small patio area, which in my opinion is just ok. I think it could be a little bigger and more private, but if your not going to use it then it shouldn't be a big deal to you. At the Restaurant, the bartender was awesome! He knows what he's doing and is willing to help you out. A+ for the serivce he gave. I think his name might of been John Don't quote me on that though! lol The ONLY things that I think could be improved would be the bathroom, carpeting, and mosquito problem. The carpeting in the room was almost rope like in feeling so I wore sandals when I walked around. The bathroom was not disgusting but it did look run down. There was also this strange occurance of several small mosquitos I caught flying in the room. I think they might be coming from the plants. Those problems are small and the rest of the experience was so great , I was able to overlook the little things. Don't get me wrong, I am super picky when it comes to hotels! I highly reccommend staying here. For people who are constant complainers (you know who you are) don't stay here if you want a nice quiet getaway, there is a Hilton down the way for you.thanks for the GREAT REVIEW!!!!! Super cool. Appreciate it. John is awesome. will let him know.

We arrived on Wednesday June 12th 2013. as we got out of our car the hotel staff that was present greeted us . the front desk staff got our info and had us booked in our room in about 10 mimutes.Was very friendly . I would say that the room was really more like a suite than a double room. the breakfast was very good. all in all the five days we stayed was better that some more high price other hotels. And it was located just five minutes from our kids home, with a wawa just down from it.GoodMorning,Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback.

"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with my 13 month old son and our experience was disappointing from the moment we checked in. When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones. Once your requests were understood, though, our desk agents promptly retrieved a crib that was to your liking. We truly do appreciate your feedback and will use to provide better experiences. Thank you. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager",Bad
My wife and I stayed here for a night in February 2015 to meet up with family from England and we were very impressed with the rooms and service provided. The hotel is in an ideal downtown location which means that you can walk to all the nearby restaurants and attractions.,Good
It was easy to locate. A little run down. But it was clean and staff was friendly. I'm a smoker but do not smoke inside and they came right away when called about the smoke smell in the room. Grandchildren loved the pool. I would stay there again for the price was very reasonable.,Good
"The location is great. It is across the street from the Seattle Center therefore the Space Needle, Pacific Science center, the Armory, EMP, Museum of Pop Culture, Artists Playground, etc. are very easy to get to. The rooms are suites. It seems the ones facing the Space Needle (01-10) are more spacious or the layouts seems more spacious. I had family in a 19 room, which was a corner and it had the same features but a smaller table/island and living space. The suites are well supplied with everything you would need and the front desk is more than happy to give you extra supplies.The staff at this hotel is excellent. They are accommodating and very considerate. They call it a continental breakfast but I think it is significantly better than that. It has several hot food options, which change everyday and there is a always an omelet bar. In your room, there is a note with the rush hours for the free breakfast. It is pretty accurate. They also have a great happy hour and coffee is always available downstairs. For picky kids or late night eats or when the Armory is already closed, there is a 24 hour drive thru McDonalds.The only issue I had with the location was the parking garage. The spaces are tight. and you are assigned a space when you check in. The garage is underneath the hotel (which is convenient) but to drive in and out you have to use a special garage key. However, with the monorail across the street you probably do not need car.",Good
"We were underwhelmed with the room. It was cleaned very fast without any attention to detail, hairs on the bed, dirty glass doors, sticky floors and tables, etc...I really don't know how this mess was awarded a 3 star rating! Even the shower curtains were falling apart, renovations looked like they were done by a 10 year old. Sorry but not up to my standards (which are not unreasonable).",Bad
"I was placed in this hotel by the agency that hired me because the Hilton Anatole had no more govt rate rooms available. Now I am glad that they did . Its smaller and more managable than the Annatole which is HUGE. Room was pretty standard but did have microwave, refrigerator and coffee pot standard. Bathroom was on the large size. Cleanliness was not the best, but certainly not the worst. No Bed Bugs. Hotel business center is free! Yeah HGI. Also there is high speed internet in all the rooms. And you can send printing to the business center from your room. Highlight for me was the van service, especially when Reynaldo was driving. Because I am short and have a prosthetic leg I needed a stool to get into the very high 15 passenger van. He found one and every time he picked me up or took me across to the Annatole he had to run around and find it again. THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE PERMANENTLY IN THE VAN. My room was not ready when I arrived at 3:30 PM. The desk clerk offered me a snack from the little store. Or to have the van take me to a restaurant. She recommended several restaurants we settled on one. When Reynaldo and I were talking enroute, and he learned it was my first trip to Texas, he asked if I liked BBQ. He then took me into downtown Dallas to Sonny Bryans. It was great! The highlight of my whole trip as I never had another chance for a real meal again. On the way back to HGI, Reynaldo when he picked me up drove past the Book Depository Museum and pointed out Dealy Plaza and the grassy knoll. I never would have seen either were it not for him. Other employees were adequate in the restaurant etc. Other van drivers not so good--no stool etc. Desk employees were pretty efficient and well informed. The restaurant in the hotel in only open for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is full (eggs, bacon and sausage, pancakes, omlets cooked to order) or continental. There is a pretty complete buffet with hot and cold cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, fresh fruit, yoghurt, etc. Its pricey at 12 but free to government employees. Dinner menu is limited and there is a nightly special. Not on the menu, but available is a soup and salad combo for dinner at 7.95. It was exactly what I wanted. Room service is available.Dear Valued Guest:I want to thank you for your comments and feedback as this allows us to improve our products and servcies for you and all future guests of ours. I appreciate your business and loyalty to Hilton Hotels and truly value your feedback. We have purchased 2 new stools for the van so that we are proactive and have them available at all times. Thank you for recognizing our van driver for his services provided and he will be rewarded for his exceptional service. If there is anything I can do for you in the future, please let me know at anytime. Thank you again and have a wonderful holiday.Best Regards,Blake DoranGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Dallas Market Center",Good

"Likely the fanciest Hampton I have ever stayed in. Very large property, very modern and clean with a huge common area off the lobby. I think this Hampton may have the most awesome breakfast buffet in terms of size I have ever seen, and I have stayed at a LOT of Hamptons. Triple waffle iron area with 4 times the variety of toppings... say wahIn all seriousness, the rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The entire property was. The front desk staff was super friendly and welcoming. It felt like an upscale Hampton here.Now, they lost one star for two reasons - parking, they charge. To me it is insane to charge a customer for parking unless you are MAYBE downtown where I get parking is a commodity. This is Hotel Circle for crying out loud and they charge 18 bucks a day which is ridiculous. I have status with Hilton so they did lower my parking to 10 per day but it was still annoying and felt like they were simply trying to generate more revenue... particularly due to there was PLENTY of parking. The other reason was the housekeeping. We were there four nights and I had to call for housekeeping to come clean up my room. My husband had spilled a little something on the sheets and I was very surprised that they did not flip out the bottom sheet. Nope, left the stain there which was kind of gross. When they finally did clean, it was a half-hearted job, no toiletry or coffee refills, half the towels, etc. The front desk always came through for me though so it was not that big of a deal in the bigger scheme of things.",Good

"We stayed here for 4 nights. We arrived via the BART train from the airport. The hotel is only a couple of minutes from the nearest train stop. The room size was fine, the bathroom was very nice. The room had a coffee machine but you can also get a free cup of coffee every morning ( great decaf) . We did not eat in the restaurant but instead ate at Lori's Diner ( turn left out of the hotel and it's a few blocks up on the right. Really good breakfasts) . The wine hour was a really good idea, we met some lovely people through this. The whole hotel is very clean, the staff are helpful and it felt like a little oasis of calm in the city. It is well placed for Union square and the trams. Just a note on the trams, we stayed 4 nights and never got on them, the queues were really long. We got taxis to fisherman's wharf for about 15 dollars. Some people have commented on the noise, yes the dustbin men do turn up about 3pm, and you hear the police sirens etc, but if you stay in a city you have to expect noise. They do have some rooms that have internal windows which are quieter . I think these are only doubles , as there were three of us we had a room facing a side road. You could still hear everything outside though. There was not any noise from other rooms or from people walking in the corridors. The beds were very comfy, with lovely pillows. We would defiantly stay here again. Thank you Galleria Park for making our stay a happy one .",Good

"I haven't stayed in this hotel for a few years. I was pleasantly surprised hot well the hotel has been upgraded. It was nice before but now is even more classic. This is not your cookie cutter chain hotel. It occupies a building constructed in 1903, which was, at the time, the tallest (14 stories) building in New Orleans. It's located 1-1/2 blocks off canal Street and the French Quarter. The building is fully renovated/updated with all the amenities a business or pleasure traveler could ask for. My corner room had 5 windows reaching all the way to the ceiling. There is free WiFi and the free breakfast includes hot and cold items including fresh fruit. The St. Charles street car runs in front of the building. The building feels very safe as you use your room key-card to open the main doors after hours and in the elevator to access for all but the first floor. Staff is helpful and polite, and as with all Hampton Inns, there is a 100 satisfaction guarantee.",Good

"My husband and I return to Estancia La Jolla every year, on our wedding anniversary, and we wouldn't have it any other way! From the moment we pull up the car into valet, we are treated like a king and queen. Not only the service is extraordinary, one that I haven't really found elsewhere, but the design, architecture and location of the property is truly life changing. The old world charm, the secluded location, the courtyard design, all are just soul soothing. We cannot wait to come back on our next anniversary. It is very much a special and unforgettable treat for us. At the valet, Sean, Chris I, Chris II, were all amazing! At the front desk, William and Erica treated us like family, and at the restaurants, Ashley at Mustangs and Burros, truly a patient and pleasant person, who helped me choose gluten-free items off the menu, and last, but definitely not least, Lisa at Adobe was fantastic! She too, was very knowledgeable about gluten-free foods, and was so wonderful to us, that we were so happy to see her every morning for breakfast. Thank you Estancia, for always giving us a fabulous and unforgettable experience! Looking forward to seeing you all again. Karl and Lilly WilkThank you for a fantastic review! We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay, and thank you for your loyalty. We hope to see you and your husband here year after year. Congratulations, and cheers to another year! We look forward to your return!",Good
"Love Hilton Brand Hotels - typically because they include everything. We booked this room for a pre-cruise stay because they offered free transport to Port Canaveral. I have to say the room was nice enough - no complaints whatsoever here. Breakfast had to be paid for and it was ok - nothing great and nothing terrible - it was a meal. Again - no complaints on that and no raves.Now - front desk staff (middle-aged female) was not overly friendly or interested in great customer service. We were anxiously awaiting our shuttle to the port - love cruising - and were given a curt answer that the driver would come in and get us when he got there. Oh well, we wont let her dampen our spirits.The 'free shuttle - not worth it to us - there were several stops before and after we were picked up. The driver was nice enough - but we were like close to last on the ship - we personally like to be closer to first. Pick up was a bit confusing - they pick you up after the cruise too - we got to our spot, waited a little bit - but not too bad and then got on the shuttle - only to be asked to get off because of a large group he was accomodating and then put back on when there was room for us - oh boy....then again several stops before we were able to get off the shuttle at the airport. I thought I had paid for convenience and I realize this is not the hotel itself - but it was a paid for package that I would not do again. Instead I would rent a car one way and stay in a hotel in Port Canaveral. The paid for addition to our room was definitely not a good thing for us - convenience came with a cost in time, frustration and a few dollars.probably would not stay at this particular property again - it is a nice hotel - definitely within Hilton's standards - but unfriendly (not mean - just not Disney World friendly like many seem to be in Orlando - we travel there several times a year) and the wonderful cruise package with transportation to the port and then from the port to the airport not worth feeling stressed before and after a great vacation.Dear Guest tigtink, I really appreciate your taking the time to share your experience with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize for the frustration you experienced when the actions of the staff did not meet your expectations.We want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. I am sorry if this was not your experience. You can be confident that I had follow-up on your concerns/comments about the way my staff handled the situation and applied all the corrective actions necessary.We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are my concerns!, and please do not hesitate to contact me directly at the hotelSincerely, Alex BlancoGeneral Manager",Neutral
"This hotel is in a perfect location for the French Quarter. We have visited New Orleans many times. This was the first time we stayed at this hotel. The hotel was decorated beautifully for the holiday season.The staff did everything to make our stay a pleasure. When we checked in Diana made sure that our room was as reserved. We had a courtyard room with a private balcony. Diana gave a complementary upgrade to our brother so that his room was only three doors away. Our rooms were not ready when we arrived at the hotel at 9:30am. We were notified promptly when our rooms were ready. Merlin of the front desk staff was also very helpful and always greeted us with a sincere smile when we went by the front desk.Larry the bellman made sure that we always had a cab. If there was not a cab at the cabstand he would go up the street and find us one. This was most appreciated.The concierge staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We called the hotel a few weeks before our stay for some assistance. Celia provided us recommendations of restaurants that would be open on Christmas. When we arrived at the hotel she also made recommendations for restaurants that would meet our needs. We were very pleased with the recommendations that she made. During our stay we also met with Mary. She also made many good suggestions for us.Housekeeping kept our room clean and spotless. Our request for a blanket was responded to within a few minutes.We ate a lunch and a breakfast at the hotel. The food was of high quality and met our expectations. We liked the turkey, brie and apple sandwich so much that we tried to make it once we returned home. Our's didn't taste as good as it did at the hotel.",Good
"This is a nice Residence Inn on the older side. Staff was super nice. Rooms basic - no real issues other then I like the newer renovated properties. The carpet could use to be replaced.

Having said that, it's a fine property and would stay again, but not one to write home about.Hello,Thank you for the great feedback! Thank you,",Neutral

"Another great stay. Excellent staff. Room was spotless and most of all quiet, I never heard a thing even though I was told they were sold out. My only recommendation is they improve the breakfast. It was quite poor considering the location and clientele. Very disappointed. Also this time coffee was out but a staffer came quickly to the rescue. Second day same thing the high octane coffee was out. But as I told the staff I will be back as I visit Atlanta several times a year.

"Have stayed here before as we keep a sailboat accros the street at a marina. We live in Denver. Arrived expecting a bay view room non-smoking (yes, this property still allows smoking!). The door key would not work and had to ask three times at the counter for help. When we did get in, room was a smoking room! Counter manager said I should have booked directly with the property and not through the BW website!. Ended up in a room with two double beds on another floor. The front desk staff is not friendly and the manager looks like he just got out of bed! Moving to the Holiday Inn next door on our next trip.Good afternoon,We cater to all guest and there's still guest that smoke, so we need to take care of them also. Sorry you feel staff was not friendly I will have a conversation with that crew and see exactly what transpired. We try our best to provide the best service possible to all guest that walk in to our property, sometimes we do it right some time we don't.

"I was here for four nights with my husband. It is in a good place, safe, quiet, not far from the attraction areas. It is between Disney and Universal areas. The hotel is located next to the I-4 highway, we had a room looking at the highway and it was good, no noise, you can see the Orlando Premium Outlet and some horses in a vast green area. The staff at the front desk totally helpful and polite. We had one bedroom suite and it was really comfortable, very clean. The free wifi connection excellent. The only thing I didn't like and I got bored was the breakfast. Everyday the same buffet breakfast: sausage and scrambled eggs. I think they should vary it. The dinner was good and delicious. The staff at the breakfast and dinner area very nice and they did a good job. I recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.Hi there zlbenites!Thank you very much for your positive feedback.

"This was a great property, off the traditional Disney-beaten path, but a great find for a great price. My mom and I visit the area frequently and have tried many hotels in the Disney vicinity, both on and off site. We search around for best rates, and this location was one of the least expensive in the Lake Buena Vista area during the weekend we were there. It was clean, well-decorated, and lovely. The main dining area for breakfast was very clean and the staff was quite friendly. The beds were amazing they were the most comfortable I've experience in a hotel in quite awhile. The only minor issue (which isn't really on at all) was that in the room we stayed in, the sink was in the bathroom, so my mom and I needed to wait on one another to use the sink facilities. However, it was a handicap accessible room designed to accommodate wheelchairs, so this may not be the set-up of all the rooms. The room itself was quite large and we had more than enough space for our comfort. We could have through a few extra people in the room and still have been just fine. Very clean, very modern, very well-kept. This location will go into our standard rotation for the Orlando area. Well done!",Good
"This was our second trip here during Mardi Gras. This hotel is older, but everything is up to date. The suites are large and clean. We stayed on the 7th floor suites which included a mini fridge, microwave, and front lounge area with separate tv. The staff here is awesome. The plus for us is, this hotel is located around 1 block of the parade route. Being at the end of the route also gives you the opportunity to score bags and bags stuff being slung off the floats. It's also so close that if you have to use the restroom, you have a clean private restroom right around the corner. If you don't mind the walk, this location is also only around half a mile from Burbon and French Quarter. There are other hotels near, but we enjoy this hotel enough that we would continue to lock down a room during this party.They also have a buffet breakfast, nothing fancy... eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, cereal, grits, biscuit and gravy. From 530-7p they have happy hour which includes 3 drinks.",Good
"We recently had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans and we chose to stay at the Whitney based on user reviews, location, and price. The room was very nice and was really clean.

As a rule, I won't support a business that doesn't accept credit cards for payment. Valet parking or a paid lot across the street are your parking options.Thank you for recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and for your kind comments. I'll be sure to pass this along to the staff.

"Had a nice stay at the Courtyard on business, but sleep was disturbed several times in my fourth floor abode facing downtown. Loud road noise and an early siren kept my dreams away. Great and comfortable bed, nice desk chair, and timely room clean rounded out a pleasant stay. Getting to the hotel is not difficult, but if you stray from the delineated path you will enjoy some very wonderful neighborhoods, cozy streets, nice lakes, and a great downtown. Everyone was friendl and inviting, and the hotel staff was kind. The lobby has the necessities, a nice work area and seating. But it too is as loud as the city. A Wednesday evening brought a loud clamor, revelers and drinkers down to the happening bar. If you want to get some work done stay in the room, but if you are interested in meeting some friendly merry men, just sit in the lobby. Nice atmosphere inside and out, and I felt safe on the property. Ample parking and very easy access to Interestate 4 west or east. Downtown is a five minute drive west and is pleasant. Free wifi was more than adequate. Starbucks in the lobby at 6 a.m. and some relatively light breakfast foods are avaialable. Corporate rate was a pleasant 125, but a vendor I was with paid north of 200, which I think would be excessive. Overall a good experience, except for the noise.Thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor. We are you pleased that you thoroughly enjoyed our facilities and exceeded your expectations. We are aware of the noise disturbance. Our hotel and other local business are working digiently to create a better experience for everyone without any disturbances.As a sign of our commitment and apology to you, we would like to offer you to have you back at our hotel when you're in Orlando again.

"This location is attached to the Lenox Square Mall in Buckhead, so easy access to lots of restaurants, shopping, and my downtown clients. It's reasonably priced and has full services--coffee bar, restaurant, room service, and pantry with snacks/beverages just off the front desk.But what earned 5 stars from me was the incredible service. Southern hospitality is one thing these folks raise it by an order of magnitude. A few examples: My colleagues and I had access to the club lounge for breakfast, and arrived half an hour before it was over. The urn of coffee was running out--so the concierge ran downstairs and brought us Starbucks. (They also have a self-serve espresso-based drink machine.) There are also a cadre of very nice gentlemen working the door to help with baggage and transportation. One day I walked in and the gentleman with a luggage cart jokingly offered me a ride--staff with a sense of humor! And the day I left, a staff gentleman in the hall saw me with my bag and was genuinely interested in how my stay was (not the kind of rote mumbling question that desk attendants everywhere have to ask). Net net, I felt like all of the team here really cared about me having a great stay. I'll be back.Dear Mary M,It was a pleasure welcoming you to JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead. Thank you for mentioning how much you enjoyed our inspired and tailored hospitality. Our attentive and knowledgeable staff work hard to ensure our guest's expectations are exceeded throughout their stay. Thank you for choosing us for your visit to our beautiful city, and we hope to see you again soon.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations",Good
"not a bad place, but not so great, tiny parking garage, room cold water did not work, a/c was left off, had to cool down ourselves. fridge not on either. wi fi was really good. could walk to the beach from room in less than 10 mins. restaurant was not that great. it ok for a close to beach place and good view if you get that side, but some tall buildings did block some of it.Dear arthurc0, Thank you for taking time to provide us with detailed feedback that will allow us the opportunity to focus our efforts and achieve our goal to exceed the expectations of all of our guests. My apologies for the lack of cold water, our maintenance team has been informed to investigate this and we thank you for bringing this to our attention. We do strive to meet our goals as a green property with energy saving strategies and I apologize for any inconvenience this caused in regards to the refrigerator and air conditioning being off while not in use. Thank you for staying with us at the Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego and for sharing about our convenient location to the water and our bay views.

"First vacation with my boyfriend and this hotel was perfect for us! We were in town for a long weekend to see the sights and go to the Saints game. Staff was very friendly. Check-in was a breeze and they even had a room for us earlier than the normal check-in time. We had booked an interior room but they upgraded us to a beautiful room with windows and a view of the courtyard. Everything was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. Love this quaint hotel that is a a short walk to Bourbon Street, Jackson Square, and the French Market. We will definitely stay here again!",Good

"I don't usually like to complain about rooms, since I'm not booking at a top hotel. Just looking for a place to sleep on the road, but I don't recommend this place even for that. They charge an extra 1 per day (plus tax) for the room safe whether you use it or not. And they don't tell you that until you are checking out, it just shows up on your bill. The check-in clerk the first night was quirky and nice but the other staff throughout our four night stay were not very unfriendly. Housekeeping started knocking on doors to clean the rooms at 7:30 each morning. We were getting ready to leave about 8:30 one morning, loading stuff for our day trip. The maid asked me if I wanted them to skip cleaning our room for the day, since we were next in line and we weren't gone yet. The hot food served for breakfast was marginal. After the first morning, I just went with the cereal or skipped it altogether. Wouldn't stay here again, wouldn't recommend it.",Neutral

"Hotel location is excellent. Free breakfast is good/great and generous. Staff were amazingly friendly and accommodating. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. We had a room facing the Space Needle, which was a great bonus (request it at check in, if you can). Getting the City Pass was a great bonus, as most of the attractions are literally across the street. Monorail station is in Seattle Center and connects to light rail, so you can go to and from the airport in about 30-45 minutes.

"I stayed here back in February. Didn't have the greatest stay. My comments can be found in a previous review. After all was said and done the first time, the GM sent me 2 free night vouchers to use at any Residence Inn in the country. That was all well and good and I thought I was done with my bad stay. But those vouchers came back to haunt me as I went to use them in St Louis and I was told that marriott had stopped using those 2 years ago and they were no good. How embarrassing! The people in St Louis were great. Very helpful with the situation. I'd recommend never staying here again. In the end they ending up paying for my night in St Louis and giving me some points. Doesn't make up for the embarrassing situation. I even called marriott corporate in regards to the situation. Thank you so much for taking time to help us to understand what happened to you. Please accept our apology as a team. The challenge you experienced in St Louis was handled beautifully by their staff and followed up by our Leadership as they paid for the room nights directly. We appreciate your loyalty to Marriott and look forward to a long and successful relationship.",Bad
"The hotel was easy to find and everything you would expect from a budget chain like Motel 6, Free parking wi-fi, clean rooms although the bathrooms could do with updating(and hairdryers added).The best thing about staying here was the fact that it is only a 10 minute walk from the Coca Cola Factory - which is worth a visit if in town.we found Atlanta a bit strange as most restaurants downtown close at 9pm.",Neutral
"Room was very clean, beds comfortable. Breakfast typical for this type of hotel - 3 or 4 hot items (varied by day), cereal, fruit, yogurt, donuts, etc.. Pool area very small. Very convenient access to Mission Bay park (could actually walk there, but we drove to it), Sea World, easy drive to Old Town and Balboa Park, and airport. Not a bad drive to La Jolla, downtown and other attractions. Not a lot of restaurants nearby, but enough for a few days - a couple fast food, pizza, ribs. Grocery store nearby. There was probably a lot more not much farther, we just didn't have a need to look more.Hello,Thank you for sharing your trip experience here at the Best Western Mission Bay.

Was bringing a person to town to visit who was considering relocation. Great location for visiting the quarter -- sort of an unknown location for those that are not locals. So accessible. Beautiful courtyard room -- great views. Fantastic breakfast buffet. Not just pastries. Consider this for an out of the way locationthat is not out of the way.,Good
"NYLO was such a fun experience. The entire place feels like you are in NYC. The rooms are clean, modern, and resemble a loft. NYLO is tucked quietly away within a short distance from the shops at legacy and tons of restaurants. When I'm in the area again I will be staying here. Super friendly staff as well.",Good
"I always have a free bed in SF, so paying for a hotel bed seems odd, but I was here on business. If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend.Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job.Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead.The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth. There is a popular restaurant attached to the hotel. I did not eat there (spendy), but it attracted a solid crowd in a neighborhood with a lot of competition. There are, of course, a ton of delicious places nearby and it is also around the same corner to the Powell St. Muni/Bart stations. If I came to SF for business again, I would consider staying here eventhough my worksite was not nearby.",Neutral

"Stayed for 4 nights on a first trip to San Francisco. A pleasant hotel and an enjoyable stay.A clean, good sized twin room. Bathroom had no lock on its ill fitting sliding door and shower was a bit puny compared to most American hotels. However the room was very acceptable. As a British tourist I would have loved a kettle in the room, but when in Rome etc.Service was generally excellent from the staff with one exception, which was that housekeeping twice let herself into the room during late afternoon (even though the room had long since been cleaned) then turned around with no explanation when she saw we were there. We used the do not disturb sign during the rest of the stay but what she was doing still remains a mystery.WiFi was excellent.We never did locate the stairs which was a shame given we had to use the lift to travel just one floor.Breakfast was good, but pricey for what it was.The hotel is very well situated, pretty much in the middle of the city.Richard, it's an honor to have been part of your American experience. Excellent service is our priority, and I will talk to the staff about any miscommunication there might have been with our housekeeping team during your visit. I hope to see you back in the states soon! Warm wishes,Pablo B. General Manager",Good

The Marriot always exceeds my expectation. The service is friendly and the breakfast was pretty darn good. The rooms were clean with a microwave and a fridge. This is our go to hotel when we go over the border shopping.,Good

Awesome hotel and great location. Hotel is very new and extremely clean. Hotel pools are very nice and dinnining facilities are great. First time staying on property but long time Hilton member. Will stay again when visiting area.,Good
"The number one advantage of this hotel is the location. The fact that you can take MARTA from the airport, walk out of the Lenox station and be at the hotel is amazing. I used the convenient car service to get around the Buckhead area to where I was working. My favorite restaurant, Houston's, is conveniently across the street. It's also connected to Lenox Square, so it's perfect for finding the perfect gift for family at home. The staff was very friendly. When I arrived, they acknowledged by Gold status and upgraded me to a larger room on the Concierge level. The breakfast in the Concierge lounge was excellent, as was the service by the staff. The room was tastefully decorated, but a little bit too traditional for my taste. The bathroom was nice, but needs an upgrade. The bed was awesome, clean, and very comfortable.If I can get the same rate at this hotel again, I will definitely stay here again.",Good
"San Francisco is ridiculously expensive city for accommodation. We picked this hotel based upon its price within TA. Its an easy walk from the Bart Station but walk up Polk St!It is in a sketchy area of San Fran. Polk St during the day is fine and you should be ok using Van Ness at night (we were on several occasions). There is also a CVS and Walgreens up Van Ness for basics. No rooms on ground floor and the elevator is the only way up and only staff can buzz you in the door to use the elevator so you are completely safe.Rooms basic. Very basic but clean although a refurbishment would be good. Theres an Ice machine and esky/cooler that you can use free of charge to take to your room. Wifi worked ok. Limited airflow in rooms since no air con or fan. Had to ask front desk for a fan and they seemed a little offended to be honest.You will hear all kinds of stuff at night from further down in the Tenderloin but you will sleep fine. For the price it is kind of a rough deal compared to basically anywhere else in the world, hence the rating. But for San Francisco at a budget rate, its ok for afew nights.",Neutral

"Three of us recently stayed here during the Women's Final Four. The hotel decor was lovely and the staff was more than accommodating. We had a two room suite. The rooms were quite large and the ceilings were very high so it was extremely quiet. We also appreciated that the sink vanity area were outside the bathroom since there were three of us.The free breakfast was mediocre in my opinion and the 5:30 kickback was great for families, but with so many fantastic New Orleans restaurants I wasn't about to fill up on chips, hot dogs, mac and cheese, etc. The location is within walking distance of the New Orleans Arena and the French Quarter, but because of a knee injury that wasn't possible for me. The hotel is very secure. A hotel key is needed to access the elevator. There is a great grocery store within a couple of blocks for anything you may need.",Good
"Stayed for four nights. While the hotel is in busy location on Decatur street, the rooms are quiet and comfortable as they are set back from the street. The staff is very pleasant and we had no issues. The hotel is 120 or so rooms spread out over nine buildings. There is nice courtyard area in the middle near the amall pool to hang out at if desired. Rooms are comfortable. Exposed brick is a noce touch on the inside. We paid extra to have a window as some rooms are windowless. Perfect location for us.

"We stayed at the Del Sol from 10-15 August, this being our fourth stay. Whilst the hotel is comfortable, and the rooms are showing their age, it's still number one for its location to Disneyland.

If you wish to eat out, there is a Denny's in front of the Del Sol bit we would recommend the IHOP, just down the road at the lights on Harbor Blvd. The hotel also had an excellent free wifi service as well.About 500ms East down Harbor Blvd you will find CVS pharmacy, which carries all,the essential items including milk, cereals etc, including alcohol - a bigger selection and much cheaper to those couple of stores near Del Sol.If your visiting Disneyland, this is a excellent choice for both comfort and convenience.

"I stayed in Chicago by myself a week ago for 5 nights in a women's dorm room while going on a marathon of architecture tours. I stayed here to save money and to hopefully meet some other architecture enthusiasts. I had seen this hotel listed in an article listing places for people coming for the first Chicago Architectural Biennial in 2015.I didn't meet architecture tourists, but my fellow roommates were about the 7 most varied and amazing women I have come across in a long time. Let's just say that the first roommate I met was an Italian (Sicilian) who looked like your typical gorgeous, put-together Italian who was there for a conference from a residency in New York who is a neurosurgeon who stayed there in order to meet people. She introduced me to the hotel and to the other roommates not in the room at the time. From there I met an Indonesian coming back on her own to visit where she and her husband had lived as students, French student on her way home, local back from Cuba, Korean exchange student seeing the US, Bostonian in town for wedding (2nd generation from China), and a Detroit auto designer for GM (fresh from Australia).The location couldn't be better. I walked to almost everything. The hotel design is well thought out and interesting. The dorm rooms are tight but it was ok. I had the room to myself usually a couple of times each day.There are a certain number of details that are sort of loosely attended to. For instance the simple breakfast served is a bit of rolling chaos, sometimes no spoons, sometimes no coffee. But such an amazing collection of people in that room every day.I used their simple kitchen to cook for myself a couple of nights to save money and to just hole up when I was worn out. Overall, I felt very lucky to have the Freehand as my base for the week.Hello Kristi, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am so glad to hear you loved your visit and had the chance to meet so many amazing people. I am also glad you enjoyed the location and that you were able to take advantage of the amenities on property.

"I had the pleasure of staying at this location years ago and immediately noticed the changes in the decor. I could very easily go on and on, but I will not bore you with the small talk.Upon arrival, the staff was amazing (from valet to front desk) and very courteous. The room was perfectly spacious with exactly what I needed (kitchenette, lounging space, desk to complete some work, and large enough bathroom). Breakfast was available and delicious regardless of how simple of the options. I am a simply guy that has to have his waffles (yes they did). The staff were amazing and very friendly. Kim is truly an asset to the organization because of her smile and willingness to engage with guests. Overall, if you seek a location that is surrounded by an abundance of options, then please reserve a room. Uber-friendly in so many ways (riding or eats). In conclusion, I am glad I stayed at this particular Marriott location and will do so over and over again.To the staff...THANK YOU!Hello,We have passed this information on to the staff!

"One of many old and charming buildings in and around the quarter. The hotel is a couple blocks off canal on Magazine (which becomes Decateur) when you cross Canal to the Quarter. While a bit worn around the edges, the character and charm still reign. We were in the original building on the 4th floor, which meant a special treat-small balcony and roof top views. It was a great place to sit in the morning and midday, quiet and restful as a break from the frenetic pace of New Orleans. We enjoyed morning coffee and croissants (room service and part of the perks of the room). The room itself was large with great character-open eaves, but careful around the corners if you are very tall. Comfortable bed, a serviceable AC system and average bath. While I suspect renovations will update, I hope the true charm does not get lost. The front desk staff were also very friendly and helpful. There was also a lovely courtyard behind the hotel lobby to the newer wing which seems another wonderful option for relaxing before the next adventure.

After getting our bags at San Diego airport we headed to the information desk to find out the best way to get to our hotel, they very helpfully called to order the hotels free shuttle service. It arrived promptly and took us straight to the hotel. Check-in was simple and the staff friendly and helpful. Room was fairly basic but big and spotlessly clean. Breakfast is served at the Bayside Grill, just next door, and is a buffet style with cereal, pancakes, toast, muffins, coffee and juices. The hotel was really well placed in the city, near the sea and little italy. The only fault with this hotel is it's proximity to the Amtrak station and lines, each train toots it's horn really loudly as it comes in and out of the station.

"We were in NoLa for the second time back in October. We were there for 2 nights before boarding a cruise. We wanted a nice place to stay but we also wanted something affordable.The hotel is small and quaint and in a great location! We loved everything about it. It feels like a piece of history with the exposed brick walls and enchanting courtyard area. The coffee shop next door was our go to each morning.We were very pleased with our choice. What really made this place stand out was the staff. I wish I could remember names but while in NoLa, the night before our big cruise, I somehow lost my drivers license. I was so upset thinking I'd come all this way and now would be left behind while my friends went on with the cruise. The staff was so helpful in making recommendations on what to do. They helped me receive emails and print documents trying to find enough documentation to get me on that boat. They even sent a bottle of champagne to our room to help me relax over the whole ordeal. After a very stressful night, I did finally make it on the boat. I have not forgotten the kind staff that helped me out during the nightmare!

"We stayed at this hotel back in October 2013 and enjoyed it very much.I wish the same could be said for this visit.The rates had climbed a bit for medical rates since our last visit ten months ago, but that's to be expected. What we hadn't expected was that the breakfast was no longer included with the room, and we had to pay 14 a person for it. It is too far for people with disabilities to walk anywhere else to eat, and the shuttle is unreliable at best, so we were stuck with eating breakfast there.The fans still don't work in the washrooms, which is very inconvenient, especially with my son having stomach issues every time we travel due to his health problems.The a/c was much too cold. When we turned it off, it would get too hot, since it's summer. You couldn't reach a balance.We had had issues the last time with waiting for hours for the shuttle to pick us up from the hospital. We had the same issue this time, and I ended up, once again, taking a taxi, so my son, who is very ill, wouldn't have to wait for hours after already having surgical appointments all day. I did talk to the front desk about it, and, to their credit, they comped us dinner, which was nice, and did improve the mood some.We will not be returning to Hilton Garden Inn, especially since five different amounts were coming out of my visa/debit account after returning home, and when calling to inquire about why this had occurred, I was told it was to factor in meals we had charged to the room, although I'm not sure why it would take five different credit/debits to establish that. There was still a discrepancy of 22 CAD that had nothing to do with the exchange rate, and that was not explained adequately to me. Not very satisfied.",Bad

"This hotel was not the adorable boutique it appears to be on the website. While it did have some modernistic styles to it, some of that was just plain weird and made the place feel cold. Neon blue lights in the elevators and metal sinks that made you feel like you were washing up in a garbage disposal! We were first given a Two Room Studio Queen and while the main room was fine, the one with the murphy bed was stark and creepy. I pulled down the murphy bed which had a thin sheet on it, not comphy blanket or pillow like the other bed. I asked housekeeping for towels and to make up the murphy bed and when we returned from our evening out, the towels were there on the unmade bed. I called again and the housekeeping but really a guy who looked like a maintenance man arrived and said what would you like me to do with a snarky tone. He pointed me to a closet w/pillows and a blanket. Excuse me, didn't realize I had to make my own bed at a hotel. I turned on the flatscreen and it was all snowy w/terrible reception. Off to a good start. The second night we switched to a regular room w/two queen sized beds. They told us which room to go to. Later we found the bathroom was not cleaned (you don't want to know...) as well as garbage left by previous guests. That TV also was difficult to see and the clock we were given was set on a completely wrong time and the ipod plug in didnt work. Speaking of my ipod (ipad) while there was free wi-fi, it was terrible and barely worked. I'm guessing they did clean the room the following nights b/c of the housekeeping knocks on the door while we were still sleeping in the morning. They may want to consider those little please do not disturb door hangers to solve that problem. To top it all off, there is an alley alongside the hotel that every night at about 3am bottle pick woke us up and kept us up as loud crashing noises filled our room! This place would be in big trouble if an actual diva ever showed up!",Neutral
"Room was well worth the money. Valet was very accommodating and pleasant. Perfect location right off corner of Wacker Michigan Ave along river. GoChicago cards and info right across street. River taxis go between Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. House of Blues right across river. Room was small but very clean. Nothing fancy, but still nice.",Good
"Traveled to Seattle from South Carolina to visit family and friends, and to see the sights. Since there were four of us we picked the Residence Inn for its location and room size. After a long cross-country flight and cross-city taxi ride, we arrived at the hotel after midnight. Although I had been told previously that the hotel was completely booked, we were immediately offered an upgrade to a larger, more accommodating room, which I accepted. My fault - I just assumed that the offer was at the same price I had previously agreed to pay for the original room since I was not informed otherwise. It was not. An email alert received after we were in the room let me know exactly how much my card had been charged,which was quite a bit more than the reserved room. Not the hotel's fault I was tired and should have been more attentive, but at that point it didn't matter. We appreciated the larger room, especially the second bedroom.The included breakfasts were excellent, the front desk personnel were extremely efficient in helping to book the two escorted tours we took, and, since we were expecting to get some exercise, the location of the hotel allowed us to walk to the Space Needle and upper downtown areas without too much complaining from the teenager. The exercise room and the indoor pool were both used. The close proximity of the REI flagship store (an easy walk) was a plus.We ate at four of the restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (two on the lake) and enjoyed an after dinner walk around Lake Union just across the street. The room was great, the extra space was definitely a plus, and the location was convenient. Overall, a good experience.Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn for your visit to Seattle. We are delighted that you enjoyed yourselves!",Good

"My husband and I spent the weekend in Chicago for our anniversary and stayed at this hotel. We were on like the 17th floor. The room was really nice and the staff was very accomodating. The hotel is very clean. We got stuck in traffic for 3 hrs in indiana on the way to the hotel and I called to let them know we wouldn't be there until midnight rather than 9pm. they checked me in over the phone, it was simple and took less than 2 minutes. The free breakfast is fruit, tea, coffee, water, and granola but it's free so no complaining. :) the room was bigger than I expected considering we were in downtown. The location cannot be beat! It was like 5 blocks from Willis tower and if you walk to the right from the hotel, you run straight into millennium park! The famous Chicago theater is just 3 blocks away. Hard rock cafe and portillos are like 7 blocks. Giordanos is also pretty close. Actually, everything is close. We did not pay to park at the hotel but parked at a garage across the street which was cheaper. It was less like 80 for the weekend, we parked our car and didn't drive again until we drove home. It's pretty easy to find the hotel and pretty easy to get back to the highway too.",Good

"We booked the Family Studio King which comes with a Queen-size Murphy bed that was perfect for our 3,5 year old.

My husband and I celebrated his birthday in Atlanta and stayed at the Waverly. We have been staying at the Waverly for many years and it is always A+. It's beautiful and conveniently located for shopping and dining. The beds are very comfy too. We feel safe here.

"The Whitney Hotel is ideally located to see most of the sights of New Orleans. I would say it is a place to lay your head but I found the restaurant poor in terms of food choice and quality.

"This really is a nice hotel. Executive King Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Large screen tv. Fridge in room was pretty quiet ( a good thing!) Comfortable bed. Club food was also surprisingly good, fresh and well maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel has a large central atrium. It is connected via a pedestrian bridge over the busy road to a very nice mall ( and a nice but not very busy one on the walk ). Lots of parking. Just across the freeway from the new Braves stadium will make this a very desirable place although does not look like this is a very pedestrian friendly area in general and no apparent easy walking route to the stadium.I have great news, there is a pedestrian bridge being build outside my hotel to the Braves stadium. It is scheduled to be open for the first pitch next year making the area around the hotel even more exciting! Come back and see us soon!",Good

"From the outside the hotel is not very impressive, however walk inside and you are in for a nice surprise. Nice lobby! Very nice rooms and include a full kitchen. The hotel has great decor and friendly staff. Location is good. Although not in downtown it is surprisingly close (walking distance) and from there one can take the monorail to attractions such as the space needle. Hotel has a pool, gym and a game room, although we found the pool to be a bit small and somewhat murky. The breakfast is continental and very basic (like you would find in most other hotels) and the WiFi, although free, was quite slow.Dining: There are a few restaurant across the street, near the bay, they are good for a quick bite but I did not find them to be very impressive. You can get to the business district via short walk and they have more choices.Overall I would recommend the stay if the price is right. I would entitle this hotel with top marks is they had something better than average like the pool, wifi or restaurant. It just falls slightly short of the 5* mark.Thank you for sharing your feedback about your stay in Seattle.

"My family and I stayed at this place based on the good reviews from here. We normally stay at Holiday Inn Express because they are very consistent wherever you stay, but I wanted to save a few bucks. This stay was ok, but not as good as some of the reviews would lead you to think. The place is not as clean as some reviews indicate. While the beds appeared to be clean and the bathroom was fairly clean (though extremely small), the carpets were filthy, so much I didn't want to walk around with my shoes off at all (I even had concerns about walking with my shoes ON, jk). Imagine large blackened wear spots right down the middle of the carpet, from the door to the bathroom. In addition, there was a gaping space around the door which let all kinds of noise inside, which wouldn't be a huge problem if the room wasn't right next to the freeway. So, we had to deal with unnecessary freeway noise the entire time. At the bottom of the door was a space about 1/2 an inch. We had to place a rolled up towel there to keep light out, but nothing would stop the sound. My wife didn't seem to mind the noise and said it was like white noise to help her sleep better. I was bothered because it should have been obvious to whoever installed the door and could be remedied with a cheap seal from Home Depot. The location seemed ok, no more dangerous than other parts of San Diego. Parking was ample. The staff were pretty friendly. The breakfast was decent, better than some other hotels, not much selection though. Also, the area where breakfast was served only has two tables to sit at. The Wi-fi was fast enough for Netflix/Hulu, though the TV was pretty small. The clock radio gave off random noises that could not be controlled. It would randomly turn on and play static, not matter what you did to it. Also, I noticed that the smoke alarm was not turned on. I climbed up on the bed to take a look and I was right, it wasn't even connected. The A/C did work well and was pretty quiet.The room itself was pretty small for a double queen, as many other reviews state. Overall, I give the room a 2 out of 5, but the establishment a 3 out of 5 since some of the problems I experienced may have only been with my room (e.g. dirty carpet, gap in door, broken clock radio). This is a decent place if you are overly concerned about the price. However, my next stay I will likely just spend a few extra bucks and stay at a better hotel, like Holiday Inn Express.Hi pcaz79,Thank you for your comments about your recent stay. I am glad to hear any suggestions to make the room quality and overall experience from our guests. For the noise coming in the room, we have installed wither strips on the door frame. However, like you mentioned, there may be improvements to sealing the outside noise by installing another seal at the bottom of the door.I am glad to hear you liked the breakfast even though the breakfast area is small. We do suggest that guests take their breakfast to the pool area and enjoy it at the tables. We have umbrellas attached to the tables so you can enjoy your breakfast in the shade!We hope to see you again at our property and will take into account your suggestion!Pratik ShahGeneral Manager",Neutral

"This Hotel, formerly a prestigious bank, may be attractive for history buffs, but is an expensive and horrible place to stay when you visit New Orleans. The rooms are SMALL, unattractive, with terrible old bedding, virtually without windows or amenities. Parking was 38/day, and it took 35 min. to get your vehicle. Almost no lobby or sitting area, the restaurant was small, understaffed, with a severely limited menu. The commode was crammed into a tiny bathroom, and we had to call down to get them to bring up an old beat-up refrigerator. There are SO Many other more attractive places to stay in New Orleans, less expensive, I would avoid this place like the plague.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit.

On the other side, if you are in the wrong room, you can hear your neighbours talking. Even though, the hotel wasn't booked out and they had plenty of rooms available, they put us in the room next to the elevator. During that night, I didn't sleep more than 30 min.

"I stayed recently for 3 weeks because I was working nearby. The property was very nice, the surroundings we not great though for a long term stay. It is extremely close to the airport which made it convenient. The room was comfortable, I asked for a refridgerator and although it was not placed in the room when I arrived all 3 times, it was promptly brought up after I checked in. The breakfast area is small but it was nice to sit in during the day. There was not too much variety to the breakfast items but everything was good. I also used the fitness center which had new equipment and was clean.Overall the staff was pleasant and helpful and the property was clean and comfortable. Unfortunately for a long term stay the surroundings are a little blah, not much to do unless you have time to venture into the city of Philadelphia. There is a Ruby Tuesday next door for dinner but aside from that I found you had to venture pretty far to find places to eat that weren't in a sketchy neighborhood although I will admit I didn't do too much exploring since I was very busy at work while I was there.It was a nicely run Hampton and I would stay there again if I were to be working in the area.",Good

"Great location! A short walk to everything in Old Town! Lots of restaurants and shops very close by. Room was clean, but basic--2 tea bags in room! Check-in and check-out was quick and easy!Beds were clean and comfortable. I was disappointed for the price paid that there was no breakfast included, and when we happened to eat breakfast at the restaurant there is was less than adequate. Our breakfast order, which we put out on our door, was not picked up at night so we had the surprise of no breakfast in the room the next morning, but the clerk in reception comped our meal as a result, which was the right thing to do.Thank you for sharing your experiences while with us.

The 2nd room had a strong odor with blood throughout all of the blankets, and the Chelsea and the Annex of the Chelsea are two separate hotels. One is a motel which is the Annex of the Chelsea and the other is just the Chelsea. The parking fee is charged as if it were a resort and the self parking is located 2 blocks from this motel. Your vehicle will be out in the open without security and they do not even enclose this area with a fence. Do yourself a favor and book at another place that is not here. You will Thank me!",Bad
"I'm not sure why this place gets such good reviews because there are other places in Napa that are so much better, see my other reviews.1. They charge your card before you ever arrive. Not just reserve the money but charge the card. 2. A 72 hour cancellation policy (ridiculous) and they never answer the phones so canceling is impossible anyway. 3. Would not honor Google offers coupon. 4. Blinds do not block the light so your up at 6 whether you like it or not. 5. Noisy street. The only reason this got 2 stars is the room is new and clean but I would never stay here again!",Bad
"After reading all the reviews I had second thoughts about staying here. We made the res, for Friday February 14, it was presidents weekend also. I thought the price was too high for this hotel, but better then others on that weekend.My husband checked in, the girl at the front desk was very nice. Our room was on the first floor 106 or 107. Very clean, updated room. What I didn't like was the price for that time frame, no extra lock on the door or peep hole. No darken curtain on the wooden blinds. If they put they security latch on the door and a curtain or drapes I would have felt better. It's close to Starbucks, trader joes, fresh market, target, u could walk to Starbucks but they others u need a car. I also didn't like that it had a 72 hrs cancel . My guess would be from the reviews that not all rooms are updated, u may want to check your room , if you don't like it move to another room. I also think this may be in the valley .",Neutral
"We needed a hotel near enough to the airport for a late-arrival into San Diego, and the BW Hacienda was an affordable choice. The service desk staff was friendly enough, but we did have to wait more than an hour for the shuttle to arrive at the airport for the 10-minute drive to the hotel. Being upfront about the delay could have let us call Uber to shorten our 13-hour travel day. The facility was clean enough, but a bit dated in style. There was some language miscommunication with the cleaning staff, but my fault for not running it through the front desk. The property is built on a multi-level terraced hill with multiple steps, patios, and elevators, so double-check your room location if you have concerns about walking any distance. We were about as far from the front desk as possible and had trouble remembering our route the first day. LOLThe free breakfast buffet was a nice surprise, with many options and good service.Thank you for your feedback. I am glad you found the hotels location convenient, your room clean and the staff friendly. Well pass your shuttle comments to the team to take a look at our efficiency levels. Normally, we dont have a problem with timing. Regarding your comment about steps to your room, I want to apologize for any inconvenience this caused.

Many restaurants nearby, and the hotel has an onsite restaurant and bar, both of which were excellent!! We stayed in the two room suite, and it was spacious and very clean. Hotel has a great sized pool, hot tub and a pool table and a mini golf course. Plenty to do when not sight seeing!! Only issue was that there was no parking spaces open the second night of our stay, since we didn't get back until after 7pm. We were told by the front desk that we could park in the pay parking lot next door to the hotel, and we would be reimbursed. Considering most hotels charge for parking and the Bayside has free parking, it wasn't so bad (6) and we were reimbursed.

"The Kimpton Hotel Allegro is a recently renovated older but well maintained Art deco hotel with an excellent location in the downtown/loop area of Chicago. Hotel features funky styling, rooms are small but tasteful in design and layout. Think NYC or European size small with respect to rooms. Clean, comfortable bed, fridge/mini bar in room with in room safe. No coffee makers in the room, but coffee and tea and newspapers available in the lobby, even at 5 am. Nice. Comfortable seats in lobby. Free wifi is available if you are an IHG member or join IHG rewards club. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Complimentary drink (Proseco or Sangria) upon check in. Nice touch. Check in is on the second floor Starbucks on ground floor. There is valet parking, but its pricey. You can park across the street in public lot. Prearrange with Spot Hero to save yourself some money. Great location within walking distance of many great attractions, shopping and restaurants. If youre in the mood for Chicago deep dish pizza, the mecca of deep dish, Lou Malnatis is a short walk (8-10 min) down the street away on North Wells.

"We stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel for 5 nights over a Presidents Day Weekend getaway to San Francisco. We had a nice stay at the Dream Inn in Santa Cruz (another Joie de Vivre property) and the Galleria Park was offering a weekend special with free parking, so we decided to give it a shot. Man, what a great surprise!The hotel is in a great location on Sutter Street, just a block from Kearny and a few blocks from Market. Union Square is a short walk away, as is China Town, and there is incredible shopping and dining everywhere you turn. One night we ate at the very hip and trendy Farmerbrown Restaurant, and another night at the French seafood bistro Plouf. Public transit is steps away, so within minutes you can easily get all over the city.The hotel is beautifully decorated with a great chandelier hanging in entry, a huge decorative fireplace in the corner, great art throughout, a very cool terrace on the third floor and even a nice wine happy hour.The room was very comfortable with plenty of space. It was a typical old San Francisco building with steam heat, but lots of charm and all the new amenities you could ask for. The bed was comfortable and there was a desk w/chair and another chair in the corner. There was a nice note and a bottle of wine waiting in the room for us when we arrived.

"This property is beautiful and spacious, with well proportioned rooms and amenities. We were greeted by an enthusiastic King at the front desk, and had a great interaction with our concierge Carolyn. The cultural center was actually one of the highlights that differentiate this hotel from others of the same caliber - we were introduced to the language of Hawai'i for the first time, and it was a fascinating topic. Kudos to Kaimana for the splendid history and language lesson - we highly recommend checking this out!Another highlight is the availability of the shuttle service - we used it almost daily to head to Lahaina or one of the other SPG properties.Now for less savory impressions:The pool bar is not really a pool bar, as you have to get out of the pool and walk across a good section of the dining area to order from the bar. My quip about this may not have been received well, as we were charged 5 apiece for club soda from the tap. I understand that gouging is customary, but seriouslyMore disturbing though is the fact that after heavy rainfall, the boardwalk is flooded and pumps have to be brought out to drain the area. This is 2018, right This is the newest property in Ka'anapali, right They could not have dealt with the drainage during construction Again, seriously My final very minor frustration has to do with the utensils - and I've noted this before at another Westin: The knives in the knife block and the peeler are pathetic. I understand not wanting to have guests cut themselves, but it is more dangerous to use dull knives than sharp ones! And the peeler was completely worthless!All in all though, we have immensely enjoyed our stay, and since it's the first time we have visited Maui in February, we were delighted to be able to sit by the pool, facing the ocean and view the magnificent whales cruising by and breaching right in front of us.Aloha CatofSpade,Mahalo for your review. We appreciate the shout outs for some of our best associates! King, Carolyn, and Kaimana receive wonderful comments all the time for their aloha spirit and friendly customer service.

This was our second visit to New Orleans and on this occasion the hotel prices were considerably more expenisive and as a result decided to stay here as this was the best deal available.The exterior of the hotel was a little tired and at first we thought that this would be the same for our room but we were pleasantly surprised that it was recently renovated.Breakfast is included in the rate which was great as there was a variety of options with a nice sitting area looking out to the pool and garden area.Overall a great place to stay.",Neutral
"Stayed here for 2 nights prior to going on a cruise. Based on the reviews, I knew that the hotel itself was pretty good, but I wasn't sure to expect in terms of its location.First off, the room itself is great. It was clean and spacious, which is good considering we were three adults in the room. There is a bit of noise to be heard from the highway at night, and while i'm not used to the sounds of passing cars when I sleep, I had no problem sleeping with this. I felt the water pressure in the showerhead is softer than what i'm used to, but again, it's not a big deal.The lobby is going through a bit of renovations, but is still a nice area. The buffet breakfast is great. Lots of different things to choose from and they even provide little bags or to-go packaging if you want to take any foods upstairs with you.All the staff we encountered were very warm and friendly, and we were always greeted whenever we saw someone.As for location, the hotel is not exactly in the heart of downtown, but it's easily accessible. It is a 20min straight-line walk to Pike Place Market (with a gentle up and down slope), and shorter if you're just hitting the shops. Of course, the hotel offers a free shuttle that leaves every hour to a few stops within the city and you make arrangements beforehand. So my big worry about the hotel's location was really not a big deal at all.I would have no problems choosing to stay here again in the future.",Good
"We just came back from Orlando for our cruise. We stayed one night at the Sheraton Suites Orlando Hotel.5 Minutes drive to and from (MCO) Orlando Int Airport. Restaurant and Bar available and Starbucks counter, coffee for purchase, Heated Pool. The pool is part inside and outside, very cool. Kids had a blast. Hot tub was very hot and close by the pool. Large Lobby with rocking chairs and couches. Free large parking on location and beautiful surrounding.",Good

"The hotel is well located between Poydras and Canal, minutes from the streetcar and not far from the noisy Quarter. I was happily surprised the staff was genuinely nice and helpful, the property was nice, and would certainly return here.Convenience to the street car stop makes it easy to get around New Orleans and Aloft New Orleans Downtownl is just a block and a half from it. Thanks for the great remarks about our team and hope you return soon.",Good

"This hotel is situated in an area not too far out of the city. Down the road, is the well known pier 39. A bike hire shop is also a minutes walk away, which was useful. Bus and tram links passed nearby, so if you don't feel like walking there is plenty of public transport for you to use.If you are arriving by car, free parking (2 levels) is available with a lift on each level to take you to your room.The staff were extremely friendly and were willing to talk.Free WiFi is available, but was a pain to connect and it kept dropping out constantly.In conclusion, probably one of the best hotels in the area for a very good price. It is situated in the middle of all of the attractions and is within walking distance of eateries and public transport.",Good

"I am more accustomed to staying at Park Place Hyatt's than Grand Hyatt's so I had to adjust my expectations. With that said, the lobby is nicely designed as are the rooms. But half of the hotel has bad views regardless of what floor you are on. A few times we requested extra towels and a few other items like laundry service and each time the staff promptly helped. That was appreciated. So was the quick check in. The rooms are a little tight but the furniture, especially the bed was comfortable. The towels in the bathroom do not know the meaning of soft and that was a bit disappointing. I am highly attuned to smells and the room was overwhelmingly fragrant upon arrival. This is something that I could have done without. As is the ridiculous fee for the wi-fi. In this day age it is insulting when a hotel charges for this service. It feels like they ought to charge to use the alarm clock while they are at it. If it were not for the Internet charge I would give this hotel a 4-star rating. But the charge feels like a thorn in my side so they get a 3-star rating.",Neutral
"Staff I freindly. Needs major maintenance work. Ice machine broke, wall plug wore out, security latch broke and some water standing. Rooms clean. Think with good updating this location would get better rating. I would stay again",Neutral
"I will say, check in was an adventure. I had read some reviews that had issues with check in and we sure had some too, but the staff more than compensated for this and I would still give full marks for the property and its people. Im going to single out Evan at the front desk and Lisa who is one of the restaurants servers. amazing service. Its nice to feel welcome in any hotel or resort, but these two staffers in particular really did make a great impression with their attention to customer service and great attitudes. It's not just the property that brings people back, it the people for sure and we will gladly return!Dear jjbozzi, Thank you for taking the time to review your experience at Estancia La Jolla.

"Just steps away from shopping, restaurants and nightlife, this JW Marriott is a winner. We were here for a meeting and had a very nice room - a little dated, but still very nice. The meeting rooms and technical aspects were fine and the food served to meeting attendees was delicious. The parking deck was hard to access from Lenox Road but that was only a minor detail.Thank you for your visit. Glad you had an opportunity to stay with us for your meeting and found the hotel so very convenient and enjoyed your food service. I'll be certain to share this with our Banquet Chef.

Easy walking distances to various places of interest, with no steep climb! A big plus here in SF!

"We were in Philadelphia so our daughter and friend could attend the Taylor Swift concert. We searched online for days looking for a good rate for a one night stay. Just two days before our trip we came across the Fairfield Inn at a very good price. The front desk personnel made the reservation process a breeze. Upon arrival the hotel staff were friendly and courteous and made us feel welcome from the minute we entered the lobby. It was easy to tell they enjoyed working there.

The room is nice, clean well appointed with free Wi-Fi loved the automated blackout shade. The Ruth's Chris in the lobby has two happy hours with great appetizers. All in all a nice hotel. The only complaint is the minute you step out the panhandlers hit you up and very aggressive.",Good
"This hotel is very good. It is in a great location and, for the price, you can't go wrong. The staff were very good and the breakfast was well stocked and tasty. The room was very clean and comfortable but the decor in the corridors was a little dated and depressing. This is only a very minor complaint and I would definitely stay here again. The front desk staff were very helpful and parking was easy - a multi-storey car park adjoins the hotel and was only 14 a night which was much cheaper than other downtown hotels I was looking at. All in all, I was very pleased.",Good
Very modern and fresh hotel in the center of downtown. The staff in the reception were very friendly and helped me and my boyfriend to give good recommendations for dining and drinks. We also got upgraded to a suite for a good price. The hotel had parking service but it was a bit pricey so we parked in a public parking just a block away from the hotel. Would definitely go there again.,Good
"I expected to like this hotel much more because of its luxury positioning, attractive lobby, free Prosecco in the evening, and brand quality, but it really falls short of what I would expect for a higher end hotel. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the public areas of the hotel are very attractive. Staff were friendly, though I really didn't feel like they made a lot of effort beyond what was asked of them. Food served at our conference was very good. But on the minus side, the room was so small it was difficult not to trip over my shoes or bump into walls or furniture. The bathroom had just a couple inches of clearance between the toilet and tub, and the toilet and sink on the other side. The sink basin area was so tight that I had to put my hands against the inside of the basin itself for the water from the faucet to hit them because the faucet was, of necessity, fight snugly over the edge of the basin. The closet depth (front to back) was only about 8 inches and hangers, and therefore clothes, only fit at an acute angle (partly sideways). Room walls were thin and one could easily hear normal conversation and the TV from adjacent rooms. Bath towels were threadbare, which was a particular surprise. Although the room itself was clean, there was a lot of dust and some debris in the AC duct on the wall, which should have been cleaned. The room window was small and overlooked buildings (walls) on three sides. A nice enough hotel, but not my idea of upscale.Hello! Thank you for choosing the Allegro we truly value your feedback! I regret to read that you did not thoroughly enjoy your stay with us. Because the hotel was constructed in the 20's, the infrastructure is difficult to significantly change. We always recommend reserving a King Premier room for added space in the bedroom and bathroom. The property is indeed historic, but we work to keep the linens and interior updated regularly to keep the rooms feeling comfortable and fresh. We hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a much improved stay in the future!",Neutral

"We had two rooms for one night here, just staying over with some family after a college graduation ceremony. It was Memorial weekend, so understandably full of lots of families with younger children. The rooms were clean I appreciate the sheets covering the blanket and the fitted bottom sheet on the bed. Two areas in the room separated by glass doors. Two TV's, wi-fi, small frig and microwave:) Our internet rate was very reasonable for the area, especially considering it was a suite. They do charge 8 for parking most we have stayed at in the Hotel Circle area don't. The downtown hotels in San Diego almost all charge for parking, and charge a lot more. This is a pretty central location to get to all of San Diego's attractions. The breakfast was fairly standard, but is a good convenience to have to get something to eat in the AM before taking off to do touristy things.We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to submit your nice comments about your recent stay with us. We are glad you and your family enjoyed our suites with two separate living/sleeping areas and all their standard extra features. A survey of competing hotels in our immediate area found most do have a parking charge as we do, but we feel our competitive rates, unique room suites, and central location more than offset this. It is nice to know you enjoyed our free breakfast buffet. We are constantly adding new items and try to offer changing daily selections. Many of our guests also like that they can choose to eat in the breakfast room or on the adjoining patio overlooking the pool. We hope you had the opportunity to enjoy both and that you will choose to say with us again on your next visit. Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming, General Manager",Good

"We were only staying here one night so I didn't think we would die here. Got 2 rooms for a good price and it was just a place to sleep and shower before getting on the road home. Absolutely do not get a room towards the highway because you will not sleep. I would not stay here for more than one night. If thats all you need then you will be ok, do not spend your whole vacation here. There has got to be better places down the road to stay for a little more money.",Neutral
"There are many good things about this hotel. The staff was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful the gardens are beautiful the pool with the bar service is nice and we had no complaints about the food in Adobe and the wine bar. The room was spacious enough and the bathroom was nice, with plenty of towels (one of my pet peeves is a hotel that gives you only 2-3 towels per room to start). A nice place for sure. The only real issue is that the hotel is located far away from San Diego and even downtown La Jolla--a 40 dollar and 20 dollar cab ride, to be more specific--so I'm not sure I would recommend this as a vacation hotel unless you had a rental car and didn't mind driving everywhere. Of course, this is my fault for not researching San Diego very well beforehand, so I can't downgrade the hotel much for that in fact, if I lived in the area, I might certainly book a room here if I wanted to get away from the city for a few days.",Good

This is a family and pet friendly hotel. My stay was over a holiday weekend and there were a few sports teams staying here. If you prefer a quite relaxing stay this hotel may not be for you. Kids running in the halls, riding the elevators, and screaming in the pool but then again, that is what kids do! However this may not be the norm since schools just let out. The hotel is close to restaurants and shopping as well as movie theaters. It is right off Interstate 17 so easy off easy on.",Good

"I stayed at this hotel a month ago, and I got it on Hotels.com with a coupon. When I arrived, the night clerk was not too friendly, but was fast in completing the check-in process. The room was on the ground level, and had some noisy people walking past it throughout the night. On the good side, the bed and pillows were clean and comfortable, and the were plenty of lightning options in the room. I got a good night's rest. It also had a flat-screen TV, but I didn't watch it, so I can't comment on whether it worked or not. On the bad side, the shower did not have any hot water, and the sink faucet did not produce any water at all. So I had to take a cold shower and had to wash my hands, brush my teeth, etc. by turning on the water faucet in the bathtub and washing in my hands and moistening my toothbrush in the resulting flow of water. There were also none of the freebies you expect at a hotel, like toothpaste. Another downfall was that hard to step in and out of because the outer wall was high. I almost slipped when I got out of the shower.The morning clerk was friendly and completed the check-out process quickly. Overall, I would only stay here for a night at most. And ask for a room with running water in the sink and hot water in the shower.",Bad
"The location of this hotel is great. The view from our room was wonderful. The staff at this place is great. Patrick was a great resource and helped with directions, recommendations for eateries, and where to find cheap bike rentals. I would definately stay here again. The continental breakfast was more than I expected with waffles, pastries and a fresh assortment of fruit and cereal. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to San Diego that wants a beach front hotel. I would say that the only downfall was the small underground parking spots. It was a tight squeeze even for a compact vehicle. Other than that i would say an exceptional hotel.Glad to hear you had a good time during your stay and enjoyed the amenities.Thank you for giving OPI such an great review.Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.",Good
"I am a Platinum Marriott Rewards member and stayed here in July 2015 for the fourth of July weekend when I ran the Peachtree Roadrace 10k race. The location and stay were great, however, the hotel hit my credit card for no show charges which was a complete error on the hotel's part. I have contacted the hotel many times and while they promised me they will take care of the problems, to date they have not provided me with a refund for the false charges. It is now 3 months later and the problem remains unresolved. This hotel is poorly managed and needs new management. Although I stay at the JW Marriott brand in many cities, based on my experience, I cannot recommend this hotel and will not stay here again.",Bad

The Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel is located on the edge of the quarter but is within easy walking distance from the heart of everything there is to do in New Orleans. The guestroom had plenty of room and we were pleased with all of the hotel amenities. The staff members were very courteous and friendly. They helped us book tours and answered any questions we had and provided suggestions when asked. It was a great stay.,Good
"Have stayed over a dozen times now at this location for business in Downtown Orlando, and compared to other local options it is the best. The folks in the Bistro, especially Maria are super!

"While booking this trip, I was looking for an affordable hotel with free breakfast that was within walking distance of Disneyland for a four-person bachelorette trip. This hotel was perfect.ROOM: The hotel is an older property but it has been very well maintained and the hotel rooms have been updated recently with new counters and lighting fixtures. The bathroom sink/vanity was separate from the bathtub and toilet, which was great for getting ready in the morning. The beds are comfy (but we were also exhausted after spending our days in the park so I don't think it would've made a difference). There was a mini-fridge and microwave, both newer appliances. We asked for a room closer to the front of the property, which shaved about two minutes off our morning walks to get to the parks. It is not a fancy hotel but it is VERY well kept.LOCATION: The property is tucked away behind a Denny's and parking lot which means it does not get any of the main road traffic noise late at night. But once you get to the sidewalk, you can literally see the Disneyland welcome sign across the street. It is SO close, it takes just under 10 minutes to get to the security check right outside the parks. If you've got kids, the location is ideal for afternoon naps/breaks back at the hotel. Mind you it is located behind a parking lot with no divided walkway so keep watch your little ones keep away from cars driving through the parking lot/valet driveway. There's also a McDonald's, IHOP, other restaurants, and gift shops nearby.POOL/HOT TUB: We only used the hot tub one evening after spending all day walking in the park. It was a smaller hot tub but our group and a couple other guests managed to fit about eight people in there comfortably. It was nice to chat with other guests at the hotel who were clearly also Disney fans. Towels are available poolside.BREAKFAST: The breakfast room was adequate. There was cereal and milk, some fruits, muffins and pastries, juice and coffee. If you're a light breakfast person, it may be enough for you. We had some big breakfast people in our group and it just wasn't enough to sustain them for the early part of the day. If you just need some snacks before an actual sit-down breakfast later in the morning, it should be OK. But I wouldn't book this hotel just for the breakfast.All that said, I would absolutely book this hotel again in the future for another Disneyland trip.Thank you for your great review. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us! We hope you will visit again soon!",Good
Stayed for three nights this past week. Check in was a breeze and the clerk was welcoming. She gave us a choice of which room we wanted and recommended a corner room on second floor cause it was bigger. Valet met us and said to park wherever we wanted - very accomodating. Room was incredibly clean and quite spacious! We never felt closed in and the shutters kept the room really dark for mid afternoon naps. We got an annual pass holder rate at 89 a night - cant beat that! The location is behind Denny's and directly across the street from Disneyland entrance - 5 minute walk. We didn't try the breakfast as we slept through it but did bring our own so the fridge and micro worked out great. We would definitely stay here again and again!,Good
My wife and I stayed here recently on our road trip around California. The hotel is centrally located for all the attractions and very close to Union Square. The hotels main areas and rooms themselves have a very bright and modern feel. The rooms themselves are compact but have all the usual facilities you would expect. The hotel does room service but there are no resturant or bar facilities on site although they do have some kind of connection to the bar/resturant next door. There is free wi-fi available throughout the hotel and an external running area on one of the lower floors. There is free tea and coffee available in the mornings and a free wine tasting session each evening.The staff were very helpful and were kean to help with our sightseeing plans. The staff also arranged an airport pick up service for us at the end of our stay.Overall a very calm and relaxing vibe and we would definitely stay here again.,Good
"Clean,tidy friendly staff,cleaners are all Asian and can barely speak English but still friendly. Street noise is normal for a big city, cable cars stop at 12 pm. Close to a very nice Italian restaurant and 10 min walk to union square.Clean coin laundry two minute walk up the street. Mini bar had enough food and drink to feed a small family.Highly recommend.",Good
We just stayed at the Inn by the Lake for the 4th time and had a great trip. We love the location so we can bike or walk most places. The pool is great and has a two level hot tub! the room is nice and I appreciate having a mini fridge.,Good
"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Rex for our honeymoon and recently returned to celebrate our 10th anniversary! This adorable boutique hotel was even more lovely and inviting than I remembered it. The location is so convenient, and we looked forward to returning to the Library Bar every night for our complimentary glass of wine. The staff is extremely friendly, and they can offer lots of good recommendations for dining, sightseeing, etc. I cannot imagine going to San Francisco and staying anywhere else.Dear Amy S,Thank you so much for taking the time to complete a review on Tripadvisor about your stay at the Hotel Rex. As General Manager of the Hotel Rex Im very pleased with your positive feedback. I will make sure to share your comments with the entire staff.

"This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. As a loyal platinum member I was hoping the general manager Anonio Demarco would be able to assist my husband and I with a huge dilemma we encountered, which was our camera (SLR) , stolen inside their lobby while we were checking out.we were instructed to file a police report and were somewhat assured to have access to the security tapes to find the culprit. Antonio was inconsiderate, rude, and simply lacked empathetic skills while speaking to us. He told he will not show us because he does not have to, blamed us for our item being stolen. never stay here! They have zero security outside and inside, lobbies are empty anyone can walk in and out and steal your luggage. Poorly designed rooms, thin walls, you can hear your neighbors literally whispering. Hot water was not even hot. Poor hotel and poor management. Extremely dissatisfied and regret booking.",Bad

"The Annex at the Chelsea has modern clean rooms. Air conditioning works well but you can't switch to heat. The front desk said they would send blankets if needed. The bathroom..was the biggest issue for me. The toilets were the smallest I have ever seen. I could not flush it. They had to send someone up to flush it . Heavy people should not go there.There were minor marks in the bathroom and grate above the shower was brown.On the other hand, the food is outstanding at Terplitzkys. The best soup I ever had. And the best eggs I ever had. Also you have use of the two pools which are outstanding ...great views,. both heated,. one more for children. The photos are accurate on the site of the pools and give you an idea of how large the rooms are. i would go there again during the summer on a monday through thursday when prices are low.

"This is a nice boutique hotel with the usual Kimpton style. The hotel is conveniently located in the Loop, within walking distance of all major attractions. The bed was super comfortable and the room quite clean. In typical Kimpton style, fruit infused water and iced tea are available in the lobby, prosecco and / or Aperol Spritzes are served from 5-6, and a chocolate sampling is available on Saturday. More good - a nice bar, ample sitting room, and a great staff... shout out to Mariah at the front desk... she's great. Two issues - (1) the bathroom is crazy small... I had a bigger one in NYC... and (2) we were out of the room from 9-3:30 and the room wasn't cleaned... After contacting the hotel they promptly cleaned the room and sent some goodies to appologize. Overall, I think this is a great property and look forward to visiting again.Thanks for the comprehensive review of our hotel! I'm pleased to see there were several aspects of your stay that you enjoyed and that you were able to take advantage of some of our offerings. Should your travels bring you back to Chicago, feel free to reach out to me directly and I can get you in a room with a larger bathroom to ensure maximum comfort! As for housekeeping, I would suggest letting us know when you prefer service when you arrive so we can best arrange a time with housekeeping during the busy summer season. Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to seeing you sometime in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager",Good

"Location, room, and staff all excellent. In the center of the city close to Reading Terminal market and walking distance to Independence Hall (about a mile) and to Museum of Art 1.5 miles. wear you're walking shoes, but you are also right across from the Septa Line at old City Hall. And speaking of City Hall, what a view! Asked ahead of time for a room and we were so fortunate to look upon the City Hall building with William Penn standing above the clock tower. It is part of the skyline and could see it all the way from the Stadium complex. Best Courtyard I have ever stayed in.Dear BobfinNH,Thank you for choosing Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown during your recent visit to the area. We appreciate your comment that this is the best Courtyard you have ever stayed in. We have a very unique hotel, in that we are in an historic building from 1926 which was completely modernized in 1999 and completed renovation in 2014. As you mentioned, we also benefit from an outstanding location in the heart of the city, with easy access by walking and also public transportation for a small fee. We look forward to having you back with us soon.",Good
"I didn't know about this hotel but was pleasantly surprised when we entered into the lobby. The hotel's decor was different from all the other Wyndham's we have visited. I absolutely loved it. The room was very spacious, and I loved the pool area although I don't swim, just to be able to go out in the patio area and sit in one of the cabana's was very relaxing. My only complaint about this hotel is that the exit and entry doors other than the lobby could not be accessed with our card keys. Would I go back again absolutely, and would I recommend this hotel to my friends, I most definitely would.Thank you for providing an honest and fair review! Our pool and cabana area is amazing, and is a highlight that many of our guests enjoy. Our engineers have addressed the issue with the doors to our building and reset the locking mechanism to ensure they are working properly. We look forward to seeing you again soon when your travels bring you back to North Dallas.",Good

"This hotel met our needs perfectly. We weren't looking for a resort to hang out at all day, but rather a clean, comfortable place to come back to and sleep after seeing the surrounding area. It was clean, well-maintained, and well worth the low price that we paid. It wasn't fancy, but very clean and well-maintained.",Good
"We were very impressed with this hotel. From the staff to the facilities from the great location within easy walking distance to all the action in the French Quarter to the ambience, this hotel is the place to stay. Cannot recommend it enough! We were also booked at another expensive major chain hotel later that week and frankly that experience paled in comparison to our experience at the Best Western Plus. Don't hesitate to book. We are seasoned and extensive travelers and I rarely give excellent recommendations. We will be back!",Good
"Okay, let me be clear. I stayed here because I needed something cheap near airport for 8:50 flight. Price was great. That's good. First floor room was adequate, no problem, but lite came through corner of cortain which was annoying. The problems: Noisy hallway. Was woken up twice. Sorry, I guess, but it happens. Biggest problem: left wake up call for six a.m., called front desk to confirm, and added a second call at 6:10. No problem, except neither call came. Woke up at 7. Now that's a problem. Threw on clothing and unhooked my phone from bathroom electric....the socket was dead. Great. Two strikes. Ran through front lobby, and said to desk clerk the problem. She was skeptical and not at all empathetic. She said they have a system that doesn't make mistakes. She is wrong. Dead wrong. Couldn't argue. Ran to car, sped to airport, missed plane. Morale of the story. Stay down the street for 20 bucks more and get woken up on time.",Bad

"Right when we arrived we experienced excellent service. It's a mandatory valet service but it was not too expensive. The hotels courtyard was extremely beautiful (they often have weddings there). The room was very nice and spacious. It included robes and other nice complimentary items. Unfortunately the view from our rooms was not very nice. It was obscured by a tree. The breakfast restaurant at the hotel was delicious and it had a great Buffett that included all the standard breakfast items. I liked that they allowed you to charge your meal onto your room. My favorite part was the beauty of the hotel. Everything from the entrance to the courtyard, to the bathrooms were gorgeous. I highly recommend it. Great for a romantic get away.",Good
"Stayed here last week-end with a group of 7 ladies and was extremely pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. Our junior suite was comfortable, good size, quiet and immaculate. Slept great on the comfortable bed. Front desk staff was very friendly and willing to help with purchasing tickets to the Atlanta Aquarium and Atlanta History Center and even offered discount tickets. Lobby was modern and inviting. We used one of their meeting rooms for 3 days and was very impressed with the view from the 12th floor room. Pitchers of ice water and glasses were delivered every morning with a smile. Will definitely return in the near future!Thank you very much for recently choosing our Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Midtown.

"I can't begin to express how much I enjoyed staying at the Del Sol inn Anaheim Resort. I spent planning a trip for myself and 6 other friends for my 2014 high school graduation. My mom and I read reviews on different hotels in the area and chose the Del Sol because of its proximity to the park, its super low price, and the reviews. We typically go to the park right when it opens and close it down at 1am, so we just we looking for a place to sleep. We booked the hotel for 5 days in late June. Under reservations, we noticed as place for special requests (aka graduations, anniversaries, birthdays). So we let them know that I was graduating. I'm not kidding you, the woman at the front desk called us the week that we booked our trip asking about my graduation. When we arrived at our hotel, our rooms weren't quote ready yet so they offered to hold our bags. When we came back for our bags, the manager came out of the office with a gift bag with a bunch of disney merchandise, balloons, and cupcakes for my friends and I. Such a great surprise. We got to our rooms and were happy to see they were conjoined. The beds were firm but comfortable. They had little towel elephants on the beds, so cute. Very clean! Rooms were surprisingly spacious for a motel. We were up on the second floor. The hotel has 2 floors in a U shape with the pool and parking lot in the middle. My group and I went to the pool several times, always very clean and stocked with towels. Jacuzzi was a favorite among my friends. Breakfast in the morning was just enough to get you going, juice, fruit, doughnuts, toast, that kind of thing. I timed my walk to Disneyland from this hotel (including wait for the crosswalk) and it was only 7 minutes! Overall, my experience here at the Del Sol inn was far better than I could have imagined! I have been to disneyland around 6 times and haven't stayed at a hotel that has been so accommodating and close to the park (including the Disneyland Resort Hotel). Thank you Del Sol inn! I look forward to staying here in the future!!!",Good
"From reading previous reviews, we asked for a quiet room, knowing that it would not have a view, but considered this a good trade. The room was, indeed, very quiet and clean. The few issues we had with the room were addressed quickly. Happy hour every night in the lobby was fun! The hotel certainly looks a bit tired in the hallways and could use some updating, but it is the staff that makes this hotel so very enjoyable. Location is awesome. We would definitely be back! Thanks to the Diva staff for making our trip so memorable and fun.Thank you for the wonderful feedback on your recent stay.

We were part of large group that traveled across the county for a wedding. Rooms are set up with stools at a kitchen island along the sofa arrangement in living area, create a larger sitting area, making rooms comfortable for several people to meet or just for two to lounge comfortably in room between activities. Larger hang out areas available in lobby and roof top make it a great place for a large group to mingle. Staff was super nice, helping with early check-in an holding our luggage for several hours after our check-out. Continental breakfast was a nice variety, hot and fresh. Only thing I would change is to have lounge/restaurant area open for at least light lunch options and stay open through night. Currently after breakfast it is closed and reopens at 4pm.",Good

"Location: The location is great. It's just a few minutes to the 72nd street subway, The Dakota where Lennon was shot, Central Park and Strawberry Fields. The neighborhood is very residential and in a no-honk zone which makes it quiet. This is about the only good thing about the hotelHotel: The hotel can't even really be called a hotel. It's a youth hostel without an age restriction. In each room you get a bed, a small TV a mirror and a sink. That's it! You have to leave a deposit at the front desk for sheets and they are not the cleanest in the world. The bathrooms are shared. Each bathroom has a toilet and a shower. Imagine how long it takes for you to wait to do your business in the morning! The lifts are ancient and slow. The front desk could really care less about you being there.The only reason we booked this hotel was because we needed to get to New York on the cheap for my wife to audition for the show Project Runway. There was some other even going on at the time and hotel prices were 3X what they usually go for. For 100 a night, we weren't expecting much. I think that I would have felt ripped off at 20.Stay away...stay FAR FAR away!",Bad

"The Seattle Grand Hyatt gets high points for location and room quality. You can ignore the complaints about the price of parking, because there is no need to bring your car here. All of the downtown attractions are within easy walking distance, as are the train to the airport, light rail to Lake Union, the monorail to the Seattle Center, and buses to pretty much everywhere else. If you're allergic to transit, the hotel will call a cab or car service for you. And if you truly enjoy driving in traffic, there are cheaper places to park nearby. Be sure to ask the concierge for information on discounts to museums and events. If you want to work out, the gym is fabulous, with lots of high-quality cardio and weight equipment. Bring your swimsuit so you can enjoy the sauna, steam room, and whirlpool. And, although as a rule I don't believe in room service, especially in a city with such good local restaurants, the breakfast that we ordered in-room compared favorably to the best food we had anywhere else - good fresh fruit, excellent bread, local cheese, perfectly-cooked eggs delivered hot, top-of-the-line condiments and a not-too-sweet yogurt parfait. Really, you can trust me. It's worth it.",Good

"We stayed here for a music festival downtown and it was a perfect location for us, and much cheaper than surrounding hotels. No frills - no breakfast, but coffee in the lobby. The room seemed very clean. The floors are laminate, which is nice since the carpet in older motels can often be pretty gross. The bathroom seemed updated and was in good condition. The bed was also comfortable. We had a small balcony that looked over the parking lot and into the city. Every employee we spoke with was polite and super helpful. The walls were thin, but since that seems to be the case in many hotels I'm usually prepared with earplugs or a fan! We weren't in the room much except for sleeping, and overall this was a great budget hotel.",Good

"We wanted a place within walking distance of Blind Willie's and this hotel got the best ratings on Tripadvisor. It was a great place to stay! The room was clean and comfortable, there was good coffee in the morning and it was not only within walking distance of Blind Willie's but the Jimmy Carter Presidential library as well.

"Had a very good stay at the North Platte Fairfield Inn. The check was fast, pleasant, and friendly. We were lucky and checked into the last room available and still received a military discount. Also the clerk recommended a number of local restaurants. Due to the terrible weather, we chose the nearest. The rooms were clean, modern, new, and comfortable.",Good
"Positives- hotel is in a fabulous location as it's about 200m away from the main Disneyland walkway.- rooms are large and clean- bag storage upon check out- close to food outlets such as Denny's and Ihop.Negatives- at check in I was asked to provide a credit card which is standard, but what's not standard is for a hold of the full accommodation cost to be placed against my card, especially when I stated that I wished to pay by cash (and had it on me). I was not impressed by this as I am likely to be charged fees for going over my credit limit for this.- I had a room in the ground (level 1) and there is zero sound proofing between the floors - every morning I was woken at 6-6.30am by what sounded like a herd of elephants above me and when they turned on their water it was like a machine was turned on in my room (and 10x louder than me turning on my own shower).- drinks machine only takes coins- breakfast left little to be desired. Only had jelly to spread on toast. One morning there was no cups for juice, juice machine wasn't working and there was very little food.- parked cars allowed very little room to walk out of room and out of complexOverall whilst this location is great, I would pay a little more money and stay somewhere else close by.",Neutral
"My first time in San Francisco and I wanted a good central location with restaurants, bars, shopping and access to sightseeing. This was the perfect location! My BFF was flying in meeting me but her flight came in hours prior to my arrival. She text me to say they accommodated her early arrival and they really made her check in easy. Once I arrived I gave my keys to the valet and didn't see my car again until checkout 4 days later. No need for a car and parking is crazy. Just leave your car, we either walked or used Lyft. Valet parking was just under 70 per day. I found that a little crazy but I understand. The room was comfy and we had a great view of Post St. The bathroom was tiny but in reality It had everything necessary and the shower was actually great, water pressure and size. Counter top is where the bathroom was lacking. I dealt with it and was good. The main part of the room was chic and modern and there was a fridge in the room. We had 2 double beds and had plenty of room. Very clean. The staff was great and amenities were nice - computer, bar/restaurant and mini store, The Valet guys were very knowledgeable about places to eat. There were several places within just a few blocks that were really great.Union Square was a short downhill 4 block walk. The sightseeing doubledecker bus was there along with the cable car and a big shopping area with a mall and the upscale name brand designer stores. Overall, this pick was great for my first San Francisco experience and the price was just as good.I am happy to read your stay at the Courtyard Union Square was great. It sounds like you and your boyfriend had a fun trip to San Francisco. Please come again soon!",Good
"It's unfortunate that I only stayed one night because this is a wonderful hotel. The room was so tranquil with neutral colors and simple yet elegant and comfortable furnishings. The bathroom is well appointed with a large vanity area and a deep soaking tub which fills quickly. It is open to the bedroom but with a panel that can be closed for privacy. The bed is so comfortable with the softest sheets. The staff is friendly and helpful. Having checked in somewhat late and being a Starwood member (which was acknowledged at check-in) a request for a (brief) late checkout was honored without any problem. I have found that in general bring polite and reasonable helps a great deal with requests like these. My rate included breakfast which was fresh and plentiful. The service at Vitrine was friendly and quick. I was not there long enough to try the spa, pool or fitness facilities but the look great and I hope to go back for a longer stay and try them. My only complaint about the hotel is the cost to park. The valets are quick and friendly but that doesn't entirely justify over 50 to park for overnight. Also, and this is just a general gripe, I encountered a few spoiled and rude fellow guests who seemed to think that paying a premium for a hotel room entitles them to slam doors and be generally disruptive in public areas. It's just a general wish that people would be polite and act appropriately. I won't blather on about staying on some of the world's best hotels, blah, blah, blah. However the St. Regis San Francisco in my opinion ranks with those in terms of location, service, amenities and comfort.",Good

"We stayed in Dec. 2012 for 3 days. The price was higher when we checked in than what we reserved for. We were in the back and it poorly lit. Walls were extremely thin and we had to listen to a door slamming contest the first night. The breakfast was not deluxe by any means. Cheap small rolls, some fresh fruit (a couple of pieces at a time), so so coffee and orange juice. When they brought out container of rolls it was already picked through by staff. Tried to dipute the bill but only the manager could deal with it and the manager was never in every time I stopped at the office. Location was great but there are other hotels and we will stay elsewhere next time.",Bad

"The Orchard Garden is terrific hotel in a fantastic location. Walking distance to the top of Nob Hill, while also an easy walk to the Ferry Building. Nice people, excellent service. Very comfortable beds and quiet, spacious room. Reasonable price under 200 over the weekend, too. I didn't visit the restaurant, nor use the fitness equipment. Spent time in the city instead. I would only recommend one thing: the rooftop terrace could benefit from some improvement. In my opinion, if you do a rooftop space, it should make guests feel comfortable and be an oasis within the city. See Hotel Vitale in SF or Hotel Giraffe in NY. Great rooftops. When we visited the Orchard Garden's rooftop at night, the lighting didn't work. It also didn't have much landscaping and wasn't very inviting overall. It didn't even really fit with the the atmosphere for the rest of the hotel. But, I really like this hotel overall and it will get my first call for my next visit. Everything else was great and price and location are hard to beat.",Good

Fernando, who was also behind the desk, was able to find it in no time. When I asked for the upgrade I was told there were no suites available. What bothered me was Paola's attitude when I asked. I am a new Choice member and I didn't asked for the upgrade, it was offered to me when I booked the room. Room was quiet and clean, but staff could be friendlier.",Neutral

"Kimptons, to paraphrase a great movie, are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get.This was my third stay at a Kimpton (one in LA, one in D.C., and now Chicago), and I think I am going to take my business elsewhere. The front desk service is uneven at best -- Upon our arrival, the person who served us was not very professional, welcoming nor particularly courteous.As a dog owner, I appreciate that the hotel welcomes pets, however we were affronted by dozens of snorting, wheezing and coughing pugs (with their doting owners in toe) scattered about the lobby (and courtesy coffee area) from the moment we arrived until we departed two days later. Pugs Take Chicago! (and the Kimpton Allegro Hotel)!Our room was disappointing. Clean Yes. Comfortable bed Yes. Nice decor Shoddy. Bathroom Miniature. Lighting Awful. (This was very reminiscent of the Kimpton we stayed at in D.C., although that hotel was in dire need of a renovation and should never have marketed itself as a Kimpton. Free Internet NON-EXISTENT!This Kimpton is also located in the financial district (next to a theater). Stores and businesses closed early and it was difficult getting basic staple items past 9pm during our stay.Which is my real beef here: Somewhere along the line, the name Kimpton garnered a lot of respect from a few high-end properties. So now, there is an expectation that when one chooses a Kimpton, the same level of excellence and high quality hotel experience will exist at all of their properties. That is NOT the case. And I am done trying to find which ones uphold that expectation.Thanks for taking time to provide feedback from your stay. We're sorry to see you weren't fully satisfied and apologize for the issue you experienced with your guestroom. Should your travels bring you back to Chicago, we would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a much improved experience in the future.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager",Neutral
"The room was plain and small, but it did have 2 double beds and a sleeper sofa. Valet parking was 16/night with in-and-out privileges. The walls were thin and we could hear the guests next door late at night. I was on the odd-numbered rooms which do not appear to face the freeway, so I did not hear traffic noise.The complimentary continental breakfast had bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, breads, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereals, etc. Not bad for complimentary continental breakfast.Overall, it was an okay stay. Maybe spending 5 days in similarly priced hotels in Vancouver and Victoria Canada raised my expectations and the Springhill Suites did not compare favorably to those in Canada.",Neutral
"This is a great hotel to stay at. First, the moment you walk in their door you feel special. When we checked in the people there were so nice and helpful. When we arrived early they stored our luggage, so we could tour the city. Brandon, especially was very good to us. He helped with directions, maps, luggage, and even hailed a cab for us, The room was awesome, It was comfortable, clean, and we were surprised to see a washer and dyer in an out cove. The location was near all the touristy places, shopping malls, and easy to access transportation. The breakfast was great and had a great variety of food to choose from. We really loved our room and the service at this hotel..They only have two elevators, so that can be a small problem. When one of the elevators broke down, they had one of their managers running it manually, which was very helpful, and the service man was there very quick.

"We stayed only one night because we were going on a cruise out of Port Canaveral. Having a small bar right in the lobby was very convenient after a long day of travel. Front desk personnel were friendly and the room was adequate once they finally gave us a room that could fit 4 people. Yes they knew in advance there would be 4 people but they originally tried to put us in a room with one bed. We reserved 2 queen beds. But we ended up with a room with a king bed and a fold out couch. Fold out couches are not comfortable for 2 adults. There was a lot of construction. Possibly it may be nice once it is complete. One very strange amenity is offering coffee in the lobby from 11:00am to 5:00pm. Am I wrong but don't most people want coffee in the morningsWe appreciate that you took the time to provide us with this valuable feedback, mentioning positive experiences as well as things we can improve on. I can assure you that we always do our very best to provide our guests with the requested room type and apologize if there was confusion at the time of check in.

We drove around for 20 minutes looking for a spot. We finally gave up and where told That we could park in the neighboring garage. I feel they should let you know that in an email before you arrive. Thank you very much for the feedback. I am sorry that your experience was not better, but I assure you it is not typical.

The staff at the front desk gave us our rooms very quickly, the rooms were nice and very clean - no problems at all. They had a pool and we could walk to either a Dennys or Tony Romas.

"I LOVE San Francisco but this place was not a highlight. We waited for almost an hour just to check in (checkout was not much better) and in that time 3-4 different people made complaints ranging from no hot water to toilets being blocked (2 Toilets), the receptionist handed them a plunger to deal with it themselves!! When we finally got checked in we had to go accross the road and up steep narrow stairs (which I fell on twice) to get to our room which was not much bigger than the queen size bed in there. Their free wi-fi only works in the reception area and the breakfast a danish or muesli bar (only allowed 1) was very lacking!The neighbourhood left A LOT to be desired, I did not feel safe. It is in a bad part of town and is not local to the shopping area.This is one place I will not be going anywhere near EVER again.Dear Guest,You did book the smallest and least expensive room, however, it is very clean and well-appointed and does have a TV/remote, coffee/tea maker with condiment package, iron/board, hairdryer and a closet area however, you are correct, those few rooms do not have good internet connection, thus the lower rates. San Francisco is a very compact city and land is limited and we really can not do anything about that fact. We do have a very clean hotel and we do our level best, and it is clearly indicated that we have two buildings opposite each other, we market our hotel honestly and have done our level best on accuracy. We are also in a quiet street where the main Police department and all the superior courts are located just in a 2 block radius, and 4 blocks to the main cable car station, visitor center, SF Nordstrom/ Bloomingdale shopping center, our area is known for fine restaurants, lounges and cafes - SoMa District. Wishing you all the best.",Bad
"This hotel has a good location if you want to walk around the area and the price when I booked was okay. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:Breakfast was good for the price and they were able to make a few adjustments for me which was appreciated. Wifi was strong and easy to connect to - not free though. Location was good for walking around the areaCons:The staff was obviously just there to collect a pay check and really didn't seem that happy about itThey charge you a fee when you check in that you have to accept that includes access to a paper, wifi, and some other basic things. It was 21 and stating the hotel has free wifi but then making you pay a fee to cover it is not transparent.The room was in pretty poor shape, paint was chipped in the door frames and tiles/sink were cracked in the bathroom. I know the hotel is old, but it felt neglected.",Neutral
"Beautiful Hotel in a beautiful location. Local to everything that San Diego is known for. The property and the staff help make it a beautiful vacation experience. It is part of Old Town, San Diego, which offers historical sites, shopping and great restaurants. The Hotel is central to all San Diego attractions. It is so quiet and peaceful at night.Thank you! I enjoyed your sentiment, It is so quiet and peaceful at night. This is the type of relaxing and comfortable environment we strive for.

"After reading reviews I felt this would be a good location for us for our adventures in Seattle. Here is what we found:Our room was small, dark and on the Freeway side of the Hotel. We felt it would be ok because we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in our room but after not sleeping for 2 nights because of the noise I wished we had requested a different room.The area is VERY seedy, even in the day time. Just next door is an area where people gathered to do drugs and just hang out. We were very nervous walk around the area at night. We witnessed people shooting up in broad day light. We seemed to be in their territory.We attempted the shuttle to the ball game, it was leaving 2 hours pre game so we opted to call a taxi that didn't come. Luckily we were able to flag a cab a block away and just made it in time for the beginning of the game.Staff was accomodating, valet was great, breakfast was ok, better than most hotels with free breakfast.familyofthreexyy,Thank you for choosing Springhill Suites Seattle Downtown and for sharing your comments regarding your recent stay.

The staff offered to let us return to the hotel, hold our luggage while we used to pool, gym or free internet and shuttle us to the airport when we were ready to go.

Our bay view rooms had a great view of the bay and nice little balcony. The rooms were clean, recently refurbished, and had a great mini fridge.

"Great hotel in the French Quarter. This was our first visit to New Orleans. We were welcomed by amazing jovial staff who were full of excellent suggestions for places to eat and visit. The best thing we did was leave our vehicle parked. (There is a daily cost for this.) We were able to walk to Jackson Square and explore the French quarter. What fun.

The staff were helpful and accomodating as we were first timers to NOLA. It has a lovely pool and garden area. I'd happily stay here again and upgrade to one of the rooms with a balcony. The only suggestion I would have is a bit of improvement on the breakfast might be beneficial but since NOLA is full of restaurants there are innumerable other options.Nancy, we are so pleased that you enjoyed our charm, comfortable beds, great location, and price tag! Our courtyard pool is our favorite oasis in the French Quarter. We look forward to hosting you again for another luxurious stay soon!",Good

"This is a very nice hotel but it is not a 5 star hotel by any means. When we travel we usually stay in Ritz Carlton's and we just stayed at The Langham in Chicago in September. This hotel does not even compare. The buffet breakfast was very good but very expensive. It was 76 for 2 people. The room service food was also very good as well. The rooms were more for a Business Traveler.Dear Guest,Thank you for staying at Mandarin Oriental, Miami. Your constructive comments are very important to us.I regret to learn the hotel did not meet your expectations as we strive to ensure all of our guests have an enjoyable and memorable stay. I have taken your comments into consideration and shared it with the management team. Please understand the hotel is competitively priced with other luxury brands in Miami.

"I cannot recommend this hotel enough. There are so many hotels to choose from near the space needle and I am so glad I picked this one. It's location can't be beat. (literally across the street from the space needle). Ashaunti checked me in early and the staff went above and beyond to welcome me on my birthday weekend with a card and box of goodies. It was lovely! The complimentary hot breakfast with omelet bar can't be beat to start the day. There is a wide variety of food and beverage for breakfast and always coffee/tea/lemon water in the lobby. It's a newer hotel and is energy efficient. I love the security measure of needing a room key to use the elevator. Everyone greets you with a smile and hello. The room is clean and spacious and the bed is super comfortable. There is free wifi and also a free shuttle to anywhere within 1 mile. If you're going to Seattle for the Space needle, Chihuly, Public Market, etc you must stay at the Hyatt House. It is a wonderful hotel!!",Good
"It's the best place to stay for the location and price. It is right accross Disneyland and it makes for a quick return for the kids nap time before returning for more fun. I have stayed here 5 family trips to the Happiest place on earth and I will continue to come back. I have a 3 kids and they love it here. You get a quick breakfast and off to have fun. Then you come back for mid day nap and a dip in the pool. The staff is very helpful and quick to respond to any problems we may have had. The parking is the only problem with little space, but they have a great valet that makes parking a minor problem. Try it you will like it.",Good
"Members from our dating website met in Atlanta as a meet and greet to get to meet each other face-to-face. We gathered at the Hampton Inn. The hotel was clean, the room in good shape, the bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff was courteous. I only had two issues during the weekend: 1. the commode flush handle was broken. I contacted the main desk and maintenance was up shortly and repaired it. 2. Wireless Internet. As an HHonors member, I was entitled to complementary wireless internet connection. The network was difficult to get logged into and stay logged in. Connections were regularly dropped forcing me to constantly re-log in if I wanted to transact anything via the internet. Connectivity was better in the lobby, but by no means solid.

"The location and speed of check in were superior. However, the room had a broken lamp in the dimly lit room and 2 light bulbs out in the bathroom, so that made the already dark room a little too dark. The charm of the molding and the brick wall in the room were nice, but we could hear every creak the ceiling made when the person above us walked across the floor. It sounded as if they were walking non-stop after 8 am, and it obstructed sleep after that point. We were in room 232-which was near the staircase, so I don't know if this played a factor or if it is like this in other rooms.Hi Sarah, thank you for choosing our historic French Quarter hotel and taking the time to share your valuable feedback!

"Don't let the Priceline or Hotwire star rating fool you. This is NOT a 3 star hotel. This is an older hotel with wear and tear that makes this more of a 2 star hotel. The last time this place was renovated was (I'm guessing) more than 10 years ago. Tell me, how clean do you expect 10 year old carpet to be The lack of an in-room microwave and no poolside towels are two notable deficiencies. Most Best Western's provide some sort of a breakfast but this place does not. Having said that, the location in Mission Valley is very convenient and when you factor in free parking and discount pricing (from Hotwire / Priceline)... this place is actually a decent value. A Crown Jewel in the Best Western Empire IT IS NOT... but for a short stay at a convenient place in San Diego with free parking, the discount price may offset some of the limitations.",Neutral

The wine tasting was lots of fun created an enjoyable buzz in the lobby amongst the guests. It is an older building so the rooms are small being in the city there is noise.

"Smallest room but that's SF! We got an interior room away from the street so it was quiet. Little odd that the sink is outside of bathroom but you get used to it! Wall unit AC was adequate for ventilation to keep air moving. SF Weather was perfect during our stay at 58-75 degrees. Odd thing one day was no hot water at 1 pm when I went to take a shower, just a one off I guess. Elevator seems a bit dodgy at times but still functional, just have to use the close door button frequently!There's a Starbucks next door for coffee and Colibri Mexican restaurant the other direction. (Colibri must be a good place because we couldn't get a seat to the bar for happy hour for two days, so we gave up!)I would stay again but there are other nicer looking options a couple of blocks away at Union Square.

Pedro, our doorman was also superb and was always there with a smile and ready to answer our slew of touristy questions. Each day we started our day with fresh croissants and coffee delivered to our room. Hotels don't even have to do this nowadays and I certainly think it was a great touch.

"I will start by aknowledging the fact that we got this room from a discount website so my review is based on the fact that I did not pay a lot. Pros: even being on the lower level (8th floor) we had amazing views of the city. Also the check in went smoothly even if it was barely 11 am when we got there we were able to het a room right away. The attention to details was evident on that day from the greeting at ground level and taking us to the elevator to the employee that took the elevator with us and spoke to us about our trip. Also I felt that the room was big enough and very comfortable.Cons: I did not feel like I was in such a luxury hotel, I was under the impression that Conrad was over the top luxury hotel and this was not the case. Putting the lobby on the 20th floor is a good idea but appart from that there was no architectural details putting the Conrad in a classe part. The bar is right next to the reception and it gets super loud. Would not want to do my check in when the bar is busy. Also we had no shower gel for the fist day... a lot of shampoo but nit shower gel. We called reception and the said someone would come with some ... never happened. So I would really come back to the Conrad but never at regular price.Dear boommtl, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago for your stay. I appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your stay and providing us with further details on how we can improve the experience for other travelers and guests. I am sorry you did not receive the requested housekeeping items during your stay with us and feel the value of the hotel is not worth the regular room price. We are constantly working diligently to improve service based on feedback such as yours and will certainly share this with the team. Sincerely, Tod Chambers",Good
"For the price and what you receive this is a great deal. I spent one night. Breakfast was awesome and staff was welcoming. The room was large and free wifi! I would definitely stay here again. Call or go to their website.Dear Julia A., We are so glad you so enjoyed your stay at the newly renovated full service Best Western Plus Dallas Hotel Conference Center! Pleased that you got to take advantage of some of the complimentary amenities such as full hotel breakfast and WIFI. Also so glad you encountered welcoming staff. Thank you for your stay and your positive review. Safe travels!",Good
"Spent the first three nights of a family trip here, using it as a base to see Legoland and Seaworld. The hotel itself is fine (we had a room with a bedroom separated by a sliding door for the children, complete with bunk beds), has a good outdoor pool and spa, and a decent free hot breakfast. All in all nothing sensational, but clean, tidy, reasonable value and - assuming you don't miss the turn off from Mission Valley Fwy! - in a convenient location, only 5-10 minutes from Seaworld and maybe half an hour from Legoland.I am very pleased you enjoyed your stay with us and you were able to enjoy our pool and spa, as well as SeaWorld and LEGOLAND. Sorry you had hard time finding our hotel our frequent guests like to remember that we are on the same exit as the Mission Valley Mall. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us, too often, guests do not take the time to share their positive comments but the good service you experienced is what my staff and I strive to provide to each and every guest. We hope to see you again soon! Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming General Manager, Comfort Suites Mission Valley.",Good
"This hotel offers a comfortable, well maintained facility with great amenities such as hot, fresh popcorn every afternoon, full hot breakfast (think sausage, eggs, biscuits, waffles--the works) and an afternoon kick back with 3 complimentary drinks (mixed drinks or wine), salad, nacho's, chili, hot dogs...More",Good
"Came here for an overnighter. As HHonors members, we got the smallest odd room 239, an angled room with an unsightly view of the buildings rooftop equipment. Walls were very thin so we could here the people next door talking and watching tv. Was not a bad experience but was not a great one either. The room was nice but cramp. Microwave and fridge in the room but was not used. Not bad for overnight but go somewhere else if you intend to stsy for a long weekend. I thought as a HHonors i would get just a bit better room but thats not the case. I stayed at a Hilton property near this one also about 3weeks prior and again, i got one if the worst rooms with the worst view of homeless people outside our window. HHonors doesn't jack to us. Dear 53wohoo,Thank you for taking the time to provided feedback about your recent stay with us. We strive to make every guests' stay a pleasant one from check-in to departure through quality service and amenities, and we regret this was not your impression. We will use your comments as part of our ongoing service training and hope you will give us another opportunity to show you the quality stay you deserve should you return to our area in the future.Sincerely,Sammie",Neutral

"The furniture in the rooms was so old that it was kind of fun and retro. (My friend thought it was depressing. ) The hot tub was very, very nice. The rooms and the bathrooms were a nice size.

"This was our first trip to New Orleans, so we had no experience with hotels in the city. We found the Drury Inn and Suites through reading reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were very helpful, and we are so glad that we stayed at the Drury. Our room was very nice, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. All the staff that we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. Wifi and breakfast are included in the price of the room as well as the 5:30 KIckback with three drinks per person and snacks. Another of the reasons that we chose this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor was that the hotel is close enough to walk to the French Quarter and Canal Street, but far enough from the noise of Bourbon Street that you could actually get a good night's sleep. We were able to walk to the French Quarter for sightseeing and to the restaurants. The street cars to get to the Garden District or City Park are also within walking distance.We would definitely recommend the Drury Inn Suites to friends or family without hesitation and it would be our first choice as a hotel when we go back to New Orleans.",Good
"Stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend. We loved San Diego and this hotel was in a great location. Walking distance (and safe walking day or night) to the Gaslamp Quarter and to the Harbour. And the street does not get too much traffic so uber/taxi/shuttle pick up and drop off is easy (10 minute drive to the zoo and SeaWorld and Petco Park). The room itself was fantastic. We got a room with a great view of the city and bay. The room was very clean with great air con, comfy bed, and hot shower. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the wifi. It's free, but it was useless. Could not stay connected and when I could it was awfully slow. But we still had a good time and this hotel overall, only enhanced our stay in San Diego. We will be back! (hopefully the wifi will be improved by the time we do ) )EN4C3R- Thank you for your loyalty to the Westin San Diego. We are so thrilled you enjoy our location, breakfast and the Westin Heavenly brand products. We are also currently planning our CAT6 wifi upgrade throughout the entire hotel and will be very excited when this is completed. We look forward to your return to sunny San Diego and getting that 5 star review from you next time!Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager",Good
"Plenty has been written about the location, so I'll just confirm, it's centrally located in Waikiki (close to shopping and restaurants) but not to the beach. Our flight arrived very late evening and we had booked a King with a City View. We were checked into a very dark room on the 2nd floor with no balcony. Given that we were staying 4 days here, we really wanted to change rooms and called the front desk but were told there was no other room available, although we asked if we could move in the morning, we were given a very non-committal answer. Given we had just had a very long flight, we just decided to accept our fate but were not happy. The next morning, we were up early and spoke to Mona at the front desk. She was AMAZING! Unlike the service we received the night prior, she immediately started looking for an alternate room for us. She asked us regarding our plans for the day, and did her utmost to offer us an alternate room before we began our day's activities. She provided us with a few options and we were moved about 1 hour after speaking with her (the previous guests had just checked out and Housekeeping was starting on the room). We were moved to a Partial Ocean View (upgrade) with a Queen bed (small downgrade). Despite the new room only having a queen size bed, it was on a much higher floor (ie brighter!) with a tiny balcony. Location IS great but had it not been for Mona's warm hospitality and service, and the move to the new room, I can say that I would NOT have recommended this hotel. The room we stayed in made all the difference! FYI: the room itself comes with 2 small water bottles (upon initial check-in only). Amenities in the room include a small fridge and microwave. Free wifi. Lobby always has chilled water and pineapple iced tea, coffee / hot water, apples (usually), newspapers and a business centre. The hotel can arrange for an airport shuttle (cost 13 per person) on a smaller shuttle generally fewer stops. The pool is tiny and although it is on the rooftop - only has 4 sun loungers so these were often taken. My recommendation to management would be to also include some chairs (I do recognize it is a small surface area so there is not a lot of terrace room). Traveller tip: make sure you upgrade your room to one that is on a higher floor (so you don't need to see the nasty building next door) and get more of that Hawaiian sunshine you've come for!Aloha Frenchie,Thank you for your review. Traveling can be very difficult to many and although you were not pleased with your initial room Mona was more than happy to move you into a room more to your liking! Many travelers that stay with us simply use our hotel as a central home base if you will so that they are in the middle of everything without paying the exorbitant prices that many Waikiki hotels charge. Nonetheless we are pleased that you made the best of your Hawaiian vacation, happy travels.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager",Neutral
I chose to stay here because I had a great flash offer for 3 nights- this was my first trip to Chicago. The hotel is welcoming and comfortable but I hate the fact that if you are not a member of their rewards program you have to pay extra for wifi. In room service- food was deliciious and promptly brought. Fitness centre is small but Ok- fresh fruit available here. Front office staff variable- many were new and knew nothing much- best knowledge came from bus drivers- they were great. Hotel has a shuttle bus that will drop or pick up anywhere within a mile- however Polk on Pink train line is only 5 mins walk from the hotel. Nice to be away from downtown bustle but easily accessible. Hotel is near Little Italy area and bus can also drop you in Greektown for easy dining options. Parking across the road for 13 a night.,Good

"I stayed at the Best Western for one night on business. The floor was dirty. It had not been vacuumed well. There were crumbs on the carpet. There was also what looked like the wing of a cockroach (or some kind of similar insect) on the inside of one of my folded towels. Additionally the phone did not work, so I could not use it to call out or to receive a wake-up call. I would not stay at this motel again or recommend to others.",Bad
People staying here must think no smoking only applies to cigarettes. Smoke rolls out of the rooms like a scene from an old Cheech and Chong movie. Property is not that old but has not been well maintained. Worst part is the staff - they are clearly very unhappy.,Bad
I was really looking forward to this hotel. The website made it look pretty cute. I did read the reviews but generally take reviews with a grain of salt do to disgruntled people leaving the majority of them. however I became part of the disgruntled group. there was no cleaning service while we were in the hotel room. We had to ask for new linens and new towels and only received new towels. The Linens had a distinct bleach stain on them that we could identify that they had never been changed. The linens are not fitted sheets they were just tucked in top sheets so by the end of the night we were looking at the disgusting mattress. it's a shame cuz if this hotel was managed properly it would be a gem. located in a prime spot on st-charles right next to a trolley stop and in a very cute historic building. unfortunately the cleanliness or lack thereof was a major turnoff. I specifically chose this hotel because it looked like a mom and pop but quickly learned my lesson. I will be visiting and specifically staying in a corporate Hotel upon our next trip to New Orleans because I know a corporate Hotel will have quality standards. I was overall very disappointed.,Bad

I stayed at the Bienville House one night in June. I had booked the room through a popular 3rd party reservation company. Long story short the reservation was wrong and the 3rd party agency was not willing to help. Luckily Tara was working the front desk and was so helpful to solve our problem (booked in a room without enough beds). Tara quickly took care of our issue and was extremely helpful and friendly about the whole situation. The hotel itself has nice character but the best part about the stay was Tara's friendliness and willingness to help.Thank you for taking the time to share your positive experience with Bienville House on TripAdvisor.

Could hear the people in the room next door screaming and carrying on, partying etc on one night. Im not a prude but it got quite tiring and annoying after hours of it. The whole floor complained about them, and I heard staff constantly coming up to tell them to keep it down. The staff really tried to do their best and had to tell them if they get one more complaint they'd be thrown out. They kept it up afterwards and started bashing on the walls, so we called reception and they kicked them out. Apologised to everyone on the floor for the disturbance.Id stay here again, definately.

"The location of the hotel is convenient to downtown Atlanta, and the cost of the hotel is reasonable. However, one of the elevators was broken and staff said that it had been out of order for 3 weeks. This meant using the stairs, and my room was on the 8th floor. My room lacked a shower curtain, coat hangers in the closet, and was not clean when I arrived.Dear David C,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel. Im very sorry that we fell short of your expectations. My apologies on your experiences with the elevator. Shortly after you checked out the repair work had been completed.

"We were visiting San Diego for a few days and stayed at the Hotel Solamar, which was situated in the 'Gas Lamp' area. This was a great location for getting around, eating out and sight seeing. Although the hotel didn't t have its own restaurant, it did have a bar/restaurant next door. Plus there are lots of local cafes for a great breakfast. The only thing we were surprised with was the parking. The hotel only offered valet parking at 45 per night, however there is a multi story car park just down the road at 15 a day, we didn't use our car whilst there and only paid 30 for 2 nights parking instead of 90.I have to say San Diego was a fabulous place to visit and recommend the 'old town trolley tours' to see the sights. A visit to Coronado Island is a must...beautiful.Thank you for the 5 star review 25mary25! I'm glad you loved our location as much as we do! JSix is the restaurant for the hotel, I can certainly see how that can be confusing with the entrance not being right inside the hotel and off the driveway.

"I have stayed at this hotel before without any problems. I am a Marriott Platinum member, so I always get placed on the Concierge floor. This time the hotel checked me into Room 420 on the top floor. When it was time to go to bed, I found the bed to be HARD AS A ROCK. I was used to the luxurious Marriott Beds (they sell the mattresses), but this thing was impossible. It was late and I ended up sleeping on the Duvet Cover for some padding. When I reported this they said they would take care of it. The next day after work (after getting little sleep the night before), I tested the bed. Another very thin pad had been placed on the bed. I had had it. I called the Manager to come to the room and housekeeping. The housekeeper was fantastic. She knew just want to do. While she was padding my mattress I noticed something unusual. The tag on the mattress said Beauty Rest, Custom Made for Hyatt Hotels. This particular hotel had not been a Hyatt since 2003!! (And who knows how long the mattress had been there, so it was AT LEAST 10 years old). The manager explained he was sorry but that they had budgeted for new mattresses. COME ON. This hotel charges Michigan Avenue rates and is NOT close to downtown. I could not believe it. On the positive side, the host in the Concierge Lounge was incredible. The breakfast was amazing and the service was great.Finally when I checked out, I noticed an added room charge. I complained and was told I would have to come down to the desk at check out. I gave the erroneous bill to the desk staff. She looked at it and I told her which one was billed erroneously. Then she said what day is that... Good grief.. she was LOOKING at the bill. Finally just said Take the charge off now. I guess from talking to the manager that it is hit or miss whether you can a new or an old mattress. And after all, a good nights sleep is a BASIC requirement for business travel. I will not stay here again... period... obviously customer comfort is not 1.And what did I get my all this trouble 1,000 extra points. That's it, Marriott UIC.. None of my business for you!",Bad

Tons of very loud kids in the pool and whirlpool, which was annoying. Management didn't seem to be in the mood to enforce any of the rules against, for example, jumping and kids without adults. Heavy security measures at the front door are a bit off-putting, but once you're past them, this is a typical Fairfield. Decent breakfast.",Neutral
"I travel through Philadelphia frequently and find a need for a hotel between flights. I found the hotel fits my needs and the price is right. Many reviews state that it needs an update. The halls are indeed in need of a face lift. My room was quiet, clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was good, but running out of things as I waited till the end to go downstairs and it was bursting at the seams. The front desk treats you as if you are the only guest and they are there for your every need. Another guest was looking for the apple store the desk clerk quickly found where it was and called a taxi company to find out what the fare would be there and back. I consider this to be over and above what a desk clerk usually does, kudos to that employee. I have had trouble before with the shuttle service with other hotels in Philadelphia airport area and found them to be sadly disappointing. You can depend on their shuttle service and as with every other employee of this hotel, the driver was a total delight, plus offered me a bottle of water for the drive.

The front desk personnel were great, the room was ok (there was hair on the bathroom floor and the windows were permanently fogged so we couldn't see Turner Field from our room, and we were able to walk to the field. We just wish they had scheduled their remodeling during non-baseball season. I mean, that's their calling card and they should play it up.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests.

"Up until about two years ago I always stayed in Hampton Inns while traveling or on vacation, but it seemed they were getting just a little too expensive, so for the last two years I've been staying at another chain that was slightly more reasonable.

"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had a rear-facing room which was nice and quiet, though someone upstairs was rather active early in the morning. The room size was good and there was even a pull-down bed in the room so you could have fitted 4 people. The bathroom was fairly average, and hot water continually leaked from the shower even when tightly off. The shower it would have to be said was pretty inadequate in that it was only a dribble when on hot. I found the reception staff helpful, and the location is very good both for BART and Muni buses, as well as shopping (for those who don't just use Amazon!). Yes, if you walk west you go into the Tenderloin but I didn't find this was a concern during daylight hours, or evening.",Neutral

"Marriott Platinum. The people at the JW Marriott Buckhead are great. From the front desk, room service delivery, lounge staff, to the other people we interacted with the customer service is great. The rooms and lounge however feel dated. The rooms are clean and spacious but it reminded me of the late 90s/early 2000s. The lounge is also smaller than expected and the food options are OK but they run out quick! Overall, the stay was above average with the staff being the stars. I would stay here again, but would like to see a facelift.Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your visit. I am glad you found our staff accommodating and they provided you with great customer service. I wanted to share that within the past week we have replaced our lobby and Nox Creek Lounge carpet and next summer, our Grand Ballroom will be re-invented.

"The staff of the Galleria Park hotel couldn't have been more helpful during our 4 night stay and were always smiling and friendly, with great recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants....they really helped make our stay there an excellent one. The hotel is in a good location within minutes of Union Square and Market Street. It was a little noisy at night but we accepted that as the only slight downside of the location. The rooms and bathrooms are on the small side but are very clean, well decorated and maintained. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",Good
We dined here for lunch and were amazed at the UFO history. This is a really FUN place and the food and service were outstanding. A nice way to spend a couple of hours.,Good
"First I will say that this is a very nicely recently remodeled and addition added location. The new side is very nice and the rooms are great. The location is excellent if you are flying out of the airport and/or planning to visit the down town area. Staff is friendly and the on site restrurant is very good. All in all is a nice location, however.Money grab is the name of the game. Room rates seem to be in line with most of the area. There are some cheaper hotel rooms in the area that are on the same level of quality as HI, This location as recently added a 10 parking fee to their service, which in my opinion makes it over priced for location. I normally check in and visit my room and relax until dinner, then take my rental back to turnin and catch the shuttle over. Paying 10 bucks for parking for a few hours is rediculous. My next visit will I will be checking out another location I think. If you do use this location...suggest you park on the streetside if a spot is open. Its free!Dear derrick b: Thank you so much for posting your comments regarding your recent stay at the Holiday Inn Bayside. We appreciate your feedback as it helps us do a better job of making sure we provide the best customer service possible. I was please to see that you enjoyed your visit and were impressed with our friendly staff. I was, however, disappointed to learn about the parking difficulties you experienced. Our normal procedure is to ask if the guests will be parking overnight and if not, like in your case return your rental car, we inform guests to come back to the front desk and give us back the parking permit and we will take out the parking charge. I did refund your 10 for parking as you should not have been charged. I sincerely apologized if it was not expalined to you at check in. I will pass the information to all our staff during our next meeting to make sure that this does not happen again. Thank you for your words of praise as well as sharing your experience with us. We would like to welcome you back during a future visit to San Diego. Sincerely, Rhinna B Meyer - Rooms Division Manager",Neutral
Picked this hotel based on location and reviews from Trip Advisor. The weekend was two ball games at Marlins Park with the Cubs. Perfect location for the ball park.

"Stayed here late June to early July for 6 nights. Had researched this hotel and checked other trip advisor postings and appeared to be a reasonable choice......unfortunately this was not the case. I am a huge fan of Best Westerns in general and have stayed in BWs in Australia, New Zealand and North America, this one by far is inferior. To call it a plus just because it has internet a pool and breakfast is a long shot. Let me give you a brief rundown. The hotel is a 10-15 min cab ride from the airport, there is a shuttle from the airport for 38 pp (all ages) return from your hotel, but a cab for up to 3 passengers was a flat rate of 14 pp one way, there were 3 of us so we cabbed it. Check in was ok, no worries, we had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool....big mistake.....TV wasnt working, reported it to front desk the first day, they forgot, after a sleepless night listening to people come and go at all hours right outside our room and walking back and forwards along the balcony we mentioned it to the front desk and 2 young men were very helpful, one was Lawrentey and the other I cannot remember his name..we mentioned TV not working and no light globe in our bathroom light, but the person who was going to fix it had left so they gave us another room, next door....at least the light worked and the TV.......5 out of 6 nights were noisy noisy noisy, security is apparently on site 10pm-7am but I suspect who ever it was had gone home with the maintenance person as well, never saw them, never heard them....spoke to the front desk and it would appear they may just be one of the many ghosts in the French Quarter. We had 2x double beds and they were hard and air con noisy but at least it worked as it was wonderfully hot during our stay. Bathroom is small, there is a safe and TV is OK. Breakfast is 630-930am, standard BW fare, breakfast meats rotate, that is one day sausage, one day bacon, toast, cereal, bagels, mini muffins, scrambled eggs (powdered) yoghurt, some fruit from a tin and make your own waffles. If you like apple jelly then this is apple jelly heaven.....not much else, it was a rare find indeed to find grape or even strawberry jelly! Juice and coffee is also there as well. Hotel is right at the top end of the French Quarter, close enough to walk to the French quarter, the river front, the french outdoor market and even Harrah's and the outlet shops are only a 20 min walk. Across the road is Louis Armstrong Park, we would go across every morning to feed the ducks, dodge the squirrels and try to avoid the small population of homeless people......still a sad thing to see in 2014! The hop on hop off bus is just a 7 min walk from the hotel, through the park and you can catch it at the info center which is a converted train station and right next door is a cemetery where you can walk around and get a feel for the history, this is where the New Orleans Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau is resting. The hotel has a lounge, sometimes it is open sometimes not.......ice machine on floors 2 and 3, thats it and a crappy vending machine with some coke products in the parking garage. Pool area is nice in the court yard with lots of tables, chairs and lounges. Checkout was a challenge but we got through it, we were honest when she asked how was you stay......didnt appear she wanted to hear what we had to say......here's a tip if you dont want to know the answer dont ask the question!...my advice, you can probably do better....if not try a room away from the pool area.......our 10 year enjoyed the pool and breakfast was ok, internet was ok and overall just an average experience....but New Orleans.....well that a whole other story!",Neutral

"We first booked a king bed suite, room no 317 was allotted, that room was dark, full of bugs and cockroaches.. as the room was at the back side..later on we changed the room and got 251, which is on second floor and corner room. But it didn't have king bed. But it was very clean and bright..room service and house keeping service is not great. A few folks only do a great job, rest all are very slow and not up to the mark If you are an Indian, you will bump into a lot more in the hotel campus. We were new and we made many new friends there. Location wise its awesome. Publix is just next building. And you have other food joints too. Dunwoody station was nearby at walking distance.Sumana, we understand your frustration with regard to your first room and regret the inconvenience it caused.

"Drury New Orleans was great and I even changed my reservation 3 different times. The last time they booked us for a suite the first night (because of lack of availability) and booked us the regular room the other nights. However, when we arrived, they let us have the suite for all 3 nights and did not charge additional (I might add that it was during the week). This way we didn't have to change rooms. Valet parking, although expensive, was great w/not too long of a wait. Free breakfast (multiple waffle makers, sausage, eggs, pastries, gravy, fruit etc.--not super high quality but better than a lot of hotels), snack type dinner (hotdogs, chicken strips, meatballs, etc..--again, not super high quality but plenty of food excellent offerings especially if you are on a budget), and free popcorn pops from 3-10pm. You could actually eat breakfast at the hotel, dinner at the hotel and then only pay for lunch if you wanted to. My absolutely only complaint about this hotel was that they offered 3 alcoholic drinks for each adult in the evening 5-7 during dinner (only 3 different drinks offered). We are not big drinkers but like to have one from time to time. We ordered one 2 different nights but were unable to drink them because they were so incredibly strong--we even asked to go light on the alcohol to no avail. We were also disappointed they didn't have a full bar where you could pay for a frozen drink if you wanted. Other than that small detail this hotel was really clean, nice clean pool w/plenty of clean towels, friendly staff, quiet and close enough to walk to shops and such. It seemed to be located between the Garden District the French Quarter. We definitely would return.",Good
We stayed for two nights in a standard room. It was of a small size which while the bed was small it was comfortable. There was a small bathroom with a fair size shower enclosure which all functioned well. There was complimentary WiFi and TV with a fair number of channels to choose from. All the staff were very helpful and polite. Any sort of breakfast was non existent except for complimentary tea or coffee in the morning on a floor above the lobby. I have two gripes one is valet parking. I realise that parking in all large cities is very difficult but the charge that the Galleria makes is excessive. It amounted to 45 a day. My second gripe is with phone calls and the charges made. I made an 8 minute call to Monterey some 120 miles idistance n the same state and was charged 12 again another excessive charge. Other Hotels stayed at on this holiday I wasn't even charged for local calls.,Neutral

"This is a decent budget hotel (thought not so budget in its price). The room is decent size, the queen bed that I had was comfy, the a/c worked fine, and the room also had a mini fridge and a microwave (I didnt use the latter, so cant testify on its quality). However, I found a few things very irritating. First, the shower. Although the shower-head is decent, you can never know if you would have hot water or not, and the water's temperature changes while you take a shower. It seems that during peak hours, like 7am or 7pm, the hot water will last for 2-3 minutes, and than you will experience 1-2 minutes of cold water, before the hot water resume. But the most diaspointing thing was breakfast - the hotel advertises a free continental breakfast, but reality is slightly different. Every evening you are asked to fill in a form, where you ask when would you like breakfast to be delivered to your door. And than, the following morning, around the time that you ask, give or take 15 min, a person will bring in one pot of look warm, undrinkable, coffee, and one pre-hitted (by microwave) croissant, with a tiny piece of cheap butter and a tiny jar of jam. This is it - that's your breakfast. Every morning I found myself going out and buying breakfast at a cafe. It is not only the taste, or the luck of it, but also the quantity, and the lack of it as well. Plenty of better options around, for the same price.Dear Np-In,Thank you for writing a review about your recent stay with us. We appreciate you mentioning the amenities that you did enjoy such as the queen bed, a/c unit and mini fridge. We genuinely apologize that your water temperature was not consistent and will pass on your issue to our maintenance department so we may investigate the problem. In regards to our free breakfast service, we take pride in our simple offering but only if it is the most superior quality. So again, we apologize that this failed to meet your expectations. We will use your feedback to better our services and hope that next time you visit New Orleans you will give us another chance to wow you.Warm Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",Neutral

"Because of the limited space in your room items will constantly be competing for it. We had a courtyard room and barely had enough space for our luggage (forget about using it for 4 people). The obvious place for bags is either in front of the door (blocking it) or in between the beds. There's hardly room for your toiletries and you have to remove them if you want to make coffee. Also, the a/c is half a foot from a bed, so you have a constant cold flow over your bed.That said, the location is really good: you're just blocks away from all the fun in Bourbon Street there's a streetcar in front of the building and you are only steps away from the Armstrong park. Breakfast was rather good as well with plenty of eggs and bacon.I am sorry to hear about your experience. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us.

"We stayed in this hotel several times when it was a Radisson. The location is perfect for us since we are visiting family in the Marina district and we like to tour the city by public transportation. Perhaps I shopped poorly this time for a deal on a room, but we paid well over 400 per night for a room that was called a deluxe double/double. It didn't seem like a deluxe anything. Yes, it did have a partial view of the Bay but it had a much better view of the noisy parking lot and the windows of other peoples' rooms. I had asked for a quiet room and was tolf this room was quiet. Yet it turned out to be right next to the elevator. Go figure. The room had nice amenities (upscale coffee pot and coffee, a mini-refrigerator) but it was very small and cramped, even with only two of us. The bathroom needed a good cleaning. For this kind of money, I expect a room to be really clean and this one wasn't. The hotel has been renovated recently which is nice, but much of the workmanship is quite shoddy and may not hold up very well. The hotel offers no room service, no coffee service in the lobby in the mornings as best I could tell, and has no bar at all. Even given how expensive hotel rooms are in San Francisco, I expected a lot more for this kind of money. The front desk staff was very nice however. Be aware that the few elevators available are very slow and small. You might want to leave extra time to get to the lobby with luggage at checkout time. I hate to give up staying at this location but I don't believe we get our moneys' worth at the price we paid.",Neutral

We like that they commit to plant trees for every trip advisor review.Thank you so much for the kind review and for commending us on our eco-conscious efforts. We opened in 2006 as a LEED (Leadership in Energy Environmental Design) certified Hotel and since then we have been thinking of ways to be even greener. With suggestions from staff and guests, we have made a number of changes that will reflect in the next LEED certification renewal. I do not want to spoil the big news to come, but we are very excited. We are also thrilled to be affiliated with a campaign such as Plant a Billion Tees. With the help of our guests we have planted 200 trees this last quarter in an effort to restore the Atlantic Rain Forrest, which is only 12 percent of its original size. Trees store an enormous amount of carbon dioxide and in return releases oxygen, something we think is valuable, especially in the travel industry.Thanks again for choosing to stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager",Good

"We were planning a trip to Atlantic City for a long weekend and hotel prices were high. The Annex at the Chelsea looked like a good, affordable option. Forget the good.The hotel is located a couple of blocks away from the beach, next to The Chelsea which is the main hotel. However, do not think that they have made equal effort to keep both hotels in good condition... The Annex seems like a old, forgotten building which has not seen a painter, a handyman or a cleaning person in a long time.Our room was old, had stains and smelled like an old, humid room which has not seen ventilation in years. The beds were not confortable, the carpets were dirty and there was a ton of noise. It was just bad.It is just a pity because the hotel has a vintage, mad men decor and feeling that, if well maintained, could have made it a very interesting option. But as it is seems to be the case with Atlantic City, they are letting it die.",Bad

"This hotel would fit right into the downtown of any major city. But, here it is in the suburbs! Obviously, it caters to business travelers during the week. But on the weekends, it caters to people like me!Why was I here A long weekend getaway with my wife. Specifically, two days of bicycle riding on the fabulous nearby Silver Comet trail. We needed some level of luxury, walking distance to decent restaurants, and a safe place to park with our bicycles still strapped to the car. The Waverly ticked all the boxes. It didn't hurt that the weekend rate was a downright bargain.Our room looked to be newly renovated and very clean. The bath was clean, too, but it had some wear showing. Like maybe it hadn't been renovated at the same time as the room.The linens were very nice, though the pillows were disappointing. Also, the mattress didn't feel like the same quality that a hotel of this level typically has. TV was good and the A/C worked well. Housekeeping was super. Surprised that there was no safe in the room, this being a business hotel.Breakfast was included in our room rate. Buffet, of course, but the food was good and it had everything we needed. But it was just breakfast. Nothing fancy. The normal price for the buffet is 18. While I know that is typical for this level of hotel, it's just really pretty expensive compared to what is available around the corner.Okay, now, a couple of things that I don't understand... The first is why does the hotel charge north of 15 a day/night for valet parking when self-service parking is free and convenient Seems weird to me, but I'm sure they know what they are doing. The other is (and it's an industry trend not unique to this hotel) why do hotels now put those heavy duvets on the bed It's too much except in the dead of winter. One is either too hot with it on or too cold with it off the bed. These things just encourage guests to run the A/C down to a low temperature to make sleeping comfortable. Okay, put the duvet on the bed, but supply a light blanket as a comfort alternative and energy saver to boot.To close this review, let me say that the best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone we interacted with was just fabulous. In particular, Amira at the front desk went out of her way with an unexpected kindness. While checking our reservation, she must have overheard me say something quietly to my wife about her birthday. 30 minutes after we got to our room, a bottle of really good bubbly and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries was delivered. Perfect and so unexpected. Just wow!I am glad you were able to spend a couple days with us at the Waverly!

I appreciate your comments and critique very much, it helps us make adjustments to continue to improve! Hope to see you back with us soon.",Good

No power outlets in the room, only in the bathroom. WiFi was fast and worked great.Location is great, close to public transportation and a supermarket.",Neutral
"Location: I was there on business and my meetings were very close to this hotel. The location is great if your office is nearby. Downtown was close, location wise, this place was great for me.Room: I stayed in the executive suite and I believe the website said this room can accommodate 5 people. I really doubt that, with a queen size bed, one long couch and little room to place extra mattresses, I would really doubt that this is capable of fitting in 5 people. The rate was exorbitant as well, I understand it was close to the US open and cruise season but was definitely very costly for such a suite. Definitely scored low on the value for money bit. I may have come in at a busy time. Lost one star on account of this.The room itself was nice enough. the view was okay. Office buildings on one side and the highway on the other. Comfortable bed and clean linen.Noise levels: I did not find it particularly noisy even though my room was next to the roads. Service: Service was decent as well. One of the days, however, I returned to my room with my door left open, blocked by the door stopper. That was unsettling, especially given that they don't have a safe in the room as well. Breakfast was included and it was average. Scrambled eggs, hash browns, pan cakes . The usual stuff really. Nothing to write home about. The breakfast area can get crowded in the mornings. They ask you to sit at the individual seats near the bar during breakfast which is fine if you are alone but with family, you may not get the tables you want.They place some tasty treats in the floor lobby in the mornings and evenings. That is a nice touch and at times better than the actual breakfast. Apparently, they do it only on the exec room floors though.The room service and reception are responsive and helpful. Other pros: They have a subway bang opposite. They also give you access to a 24hour fitness gym that is opposite as well. Would I come here again Very much so, primarily because I am likely to visit Seattle on business and it is extremely close to my offices.Would I come here with my family I doubt it.

"I visit New Orleans 2 to 4 times a year. My wife and I found the French market inn in 2011 and I stay there now ever time I'm in town. There are three reasons I like it. One it's one of the least expensive hotels in the French Quarter (often less than 100 per night) Two it's one of the nicest, cleanest,and quaint hotels in the French Quarter. Third and most important to me is location. It looks directly across Decatur street at the Mississippi River, is two blocks from Jackson square, three blocks from cafe dumonde, 5 blocks from bourbon street, and about seven blocks to the casino.The only thing I can say that I don't like is the valet service. They are not always available at check in time and Decatur is a very busy street so getting one of the three available unloading spots can be tough. If you pack light and don't plan on moving your car often I would suggest parking across the street in the large lot adjacent to the old Jax brewery. 27 for 24 hours which is cheaper than the hotel valet charge per day.I highly recommend this hotel!!!",Good

"We stayed here 4 nights in August. We arrived before check-in and were able to park our car and go over and enjoy Disneyland for a little bit before our rooms were ready. We were traveling with another family and had called ahead to request the rooms be together if possible and to have a first floor room. both requests were accommodated and we had rooms right at the front of the hotel. It was nice to not have to walk to the back of the hotel after a long day in the parks.The room itself was basic, but it was so spacious! We had plenty of room to just park the stroller at the end of the day and not be tripping over it all night. The beds were okay. If you like firm beds, you will likely be good with these. The A/C works great. This is a huge must for me when traveling to Disneyland in the summer months! It wasn't too loud either. The bathroom was clean and overall I have no complaints about the room. The fridge and microwave were a good addition. We did have a small problem of the fridge freezing our milk, but everything else was good.The breakfast was very basic. We only ate there two out of four mornings because we had other plans for those days. Overall it was enough to get you started on your day.Parking was tight, but we were able to find a spot when we arrived and didn't move until a few days later. They do double park the cars when there is no more room, but the valet is great about moving them if you need to get out. Biggest con that we had was that the room above us had an EXTEMELY squeaky floor and the people in that room were absolutely inconsiderate of there being people below them. We had two nights where they came in and didn't stop making noise up there until after 1am. If it had woken my kids up, I would have been much more upset about it. Since they slept through it, I was annoyed, but didn't mention it to the front desk or anything. The other two nights, different people checked in, and while we still hear the squeaking floor, it was minimal compared to the previous guests. The location couldn't be better, and we were able to take a break each day and come back to the room and cool down. I will definitely look at this hotel again when traveling to Disneyland.Dear Wendy C,Thank you for taking time to write us a great review, it makes team Del Sol inn proud knowing you enjoyed our service. We truly appreciate your business and look forward to serve you again in near future.Sincerely,Parveen",Good
"Again my husband and I arrived late, so never got to see all the offers from this Inn. I do know that the rooms are good and clean, a disappointing thing was the office closed down early and we had questions that couldn't been answered.",Good
"I arrived after traveling for 20 hours or so and was given a great room 320. It looked the goods and was spacious..... really looked the goods. It was a Saturday night and the street noise did not let up, emergency vehicles, drunks, fights, cars honking.......even with earplugs it was impossible to sleep. Whatever you do, when you book guarantee that you don't get a street facing room.I moved to s smaller back room that was not as nice as 320 but managed to get some sleep for the remainder of my stay.- book well ahead if you are going during a conference event. I did not and paid more than 2 x what I'd expect. At regular rates it's well priced at conference rates I at least was gouged big time.- use the concierge's car service to get to the airport.....clean, comfortable, etc, etc- there is a small Thai restaurant that serves reasonably authentic Thai that's not badHi Kev O.,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a thorough review to share with other travelers. It is very important for us to know what made your experience so special.

"Our pre-cruise stay at the Residence Inn was all we had hoped for more. Great rooms in a high-rise type hotel overlooking Lake Union, just a short walk from downtown. Open balcony halls overlooking the lobby area. The staff was wonderful. The daily breakfast very fresh tasty. The evening reception was wonderful. Management opened 2 large balcony suites with party size balconies for the wonderful 4th of July fireworks over Lake Union. If we ever travel back to Seattle, this wiil be our home away from home.We highly recommend it to all.",Good
"I stayed here for a better price. The hotel seems very new and very clean. I love the room, the interior and it was at a better location. Breakfast was good - need more eggs. Everything else was superb! Staff was very nice, too.Thank you for your stay we hope to see you again",Good
"Hands down, the best hotel I've ever stayed! Helpful and friendly staff. Cozy and well kept rooms. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. Also, very easy to get to. The wait staff at the Irish Pub attatched to the hotel makes you feel a part of their family. I can't wait to come back!",Good
"Never, I repeat, never, have I ever experienced the personal attention I received at this hotel. The director of sales (Patrick) and sales manager (Kristina) went over and above to make sure that my stay was the best it could be. I was upgraded to a 2 BR suite and they bought me tickets to a Cubs game (which I reimbursed them). Their willingness to help plan my days were unparalleled.This hotel is a tremendous value, considering its ideal location on Michigan Avenue and its price which includes a small breakfast. I recommend it without any reservation.Thank you Jeff for your kind words and for your business. It was a joy helping you and your family plan your Chicago trip, both Kristina and I would like to have you all come back and visit us again next summer!",Good
"Didn't stay here because my meeting was postponed a week but they charged me for 1 night's stay anyway--440--because I cancelled 20 hours ahead rather than 24 which is their policy. Did they rent the room anyway Would a reputable hotel do this Shouldn't the 1 night's stay cancellation fee have been waived They refused to be reasonable. Avoid this place.Dear 699 Traveler, After reading your comment on Trip Advisor I did want to take time to reply to your questions and concerns. Most reputable hotels have a cancellation policy that they adhere to in which case you are correct in stating that our cancellation policy is 24 hours prior to arrival. Orchard Garden Hotel is pleased to offer this cancellation policy as other hotels have a 72 hour cancellation policy. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience to discuss using your cancellation fee toward a future deposit during your next visit at our beautiful hotel. You may contact me directly at 415-399-9807. Thank you for your comment and I look forward to hearing from you soon,Bruce Pinckney Front Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel",Bad
Stayed at this fine establishment for the second time since November and our experience was literally a mirror image of our first stay.

"A staff as accommodating as this is a rare find. I had some trouble locating a cart as we were staying in for several days. So I stuck my head in the closest office to where the carts should be, interrupting Carol, although she didn't act like it was an interruption at all. She looked herself then enlisted the help of others and a cart was found for me quickly. Fully loaded I was pulling the cart from my car into the hotel and Greg came to my side, He took over the cart and escorted me all the way to our room. Later I found out he was the assistant manager, I was impressed that he would do that for me instead of finding an underling. Once I got everything in the room I kicked off my shoes and got things put away. Later I realized I had left on my white socks and thought the bottoms would be pretty dirty. I was so wrong I took a picture! Throughout our stay Joy was always busy, but not so busy she couldn't spread joy herself to others. She was very helpful and kind. I spoke with the Front Desk Manager, Teresa to compliment her on the terrific staff she has. Both Teresa and her staff should be proud of the job that they do, as they do it very well. Would've rated the room a 5 had it not been for having to replace the coffee pot, which was not a big deal in itself. However, couldn't wait to get to the room and take along so soak in the bathtub. The stopper did not work, even after they sent someone up. Thankfully, I came up with one of my own design eventually. Having a scaredy-cat (yes, our cat), in the room with us the first night, the kids across the hall and the person walking above us seemed loud. I say the first night, as she was so scared we had to make other arrangements for her. Again, Teresa, The front office manager was more than accommodating. A few times one night I considered using the jacuzzi, however an adult and way too many kids were enjoying it loudly. Maybe next time, yes, we would stay here again!Dear Linda, Thank you for so much for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium through the Guest Satisfaction Survey.As a valued guest, we appreciate your feedback and are delighted to hear that you had a great stay. With a spirit to serve, we take great pride in not only meeting, but exceeding your expectations and it seems that Teresa and her staff did just that! I will be sure to post this review for all our staff to see. By the way, Greg is actually our General Manager!! It's his leadership that drives us to go above and beyond!Your feedback is integral to our ability to continue to improve our service. Thank you again for your time and come visit us again soon!

"I really wanted to like the Chelsea, and I DO, in many ways. Pros: Good look, great location, good restaurant in lobby, nice beds and sheets, wifi and the desk helpful and superfast (can't understand complaints in other comments.) The women there were friendly and found us alternatives when the two annex rooms we were first given BOTH smelled strongly of mildew. The rooms we moved into smelled better but it would have been nice if the doors to their terraces locked. I play poker and sometimes leave cash in the room--or I do when I can lock it in. Also, lights broken in one and smoke alarm beeping in another of the 4 rooms: not a big deal, easily fixed, but not a sign of close attention, either. Tower might well be a different story, but l I would say, for now: avoid the annex.",Neutral

"My husband and I stayed here while we looked for apartments and toured Full Sail University. Everyone was really helpful and super nice. Todd and Mrs Dena had us laughing the whole trip, we could have spent the trip just laughing with them. Brandon was great and really made us feel welcome and happy. The breakfast was alright, nothing spectacular but something for everyone. The only thing bad I can say is that it seems like maintenance sometimes forgets that guests can hear them on the radio, just a little a sassy but not rude at all. All in all our trip proved one thing, wish we could move in to the best western. Also a really big thing for my husband and I, no one batted am eye lash about two men sharing a king size bed. Love this place would come back and will tell all our family and friends to stay here. I appreciate you taking the time to reply to this survey. I apologize that breakfast was not to your liking, however, we have improved our breakfast menu. We now offer bacon, sausage, egg omelet, scrambled eggs and much more. It's nice to know we were able to make you smile and that your stay was enjoyable. Hope to see again soon.",Good
"I love staying at Hotel Diva when I am in town. You are literally blocks away from touristy Time Square, but can also explore other neighborhoods of SF on your own 2 feet!

All have had rave reviews of their stay.",Good
"This hotel could use a remodel. The rooms are very run down. Thankfully the beds are comfortable. They had a broken light plate switch on the mirrored wall that my toddler started to play with and we quickly had to shue her away from and block. The tub wouldn't hold water for a bath for my kid. The thing that made me the most angry was they didn't provide microwaves. When I called about it they said I could pay an additional 10.99 a night for a microwave. Are you kidding me Obviously this is a scam to force you to eat at their cafe restaurant. I walked down the street instead and ate at the Burger Bunz restaurants..great food.Dear Guest,Thank you for being a guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the opportunity to share your feedback. We are sorry that we were unable to provide you with the quality of rooms you were expecting from us.

"The location is superb. I had a 3rd floor ocean view room which had a terrific view. My disappointment was in the 3 hairs I found, one obvious by the sink and two when i pulled back the sheets. Also, the furnishings are a bit outdated and shoddy. The staff was friendly.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.As you can tell by reading countless other reviews online, cleanliness is one of our biggest fortes here at the Ocean Park Inn. Although this is the first I am hearing about your issue, I can assure you this is not at all common and there are measures in place to prevent issues like this one. On behalf of management and our housekeeping staff, I apologize for this inconvenience.You'll also be happy to know that we are continuously renovating and updating the property. We are currently in year three of our plan, and have already renovated the lobby, breakfast area, and pool area. Additionally, the entire hotel has new carpet and paint, sofas, and our energy efficient GreenStar thermostat system.

"We loved this hotel. *location, room, service, it has it all... almost.The location is walking distance to The Financial District, Union Square and Chinatown and a few blocks from the cable car which will take you to the Wharf. The room, we had a suite, was spacious and comfortable. Only drawback was lack of a view (we looked into another building... creepy) We felt like we were in a hole with no windows because we couldn't open our curtains due to feeling like we were constantly being watched.The service was top notch... Oliver felt like a personal friend. He was genuinely helpful and anticipated our needs before we knew we needed him. He suggested wonderful restaurants, parking tips, sightseeing info... the list goes on and on. The front desk was pleasant and the bartender made wonderful drinks.Loved the roof top patio... a little difficult to find but worth the walk up the stairs from the 10th fl.We will definitely stay at the Orchard Garden the next time we visit SF!Thank you so much for the stellar review. Although I am very pleased to read you enjoyed your stay, I apologize the view was less than desirable. Our property was built in 2006 on a vacant lot next to some tall neighboring buildings.

Had a light dinner in their lounge and was really impressed with the wine list by glass, salad, and their service (ask for the bread service with the honey and butter). The hotel is conveniently next to the Lennox Mall and MARTA. Would stay there again anytime. if they had free internet and their towels were better - it would be have been a 5.",Good
"My wife and I travelled to NYC to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we booked into The Ritz Carlton. From the moment the doorman opened our car door and welcomed us to our departure nothing was too much for this hotel and its amazing staff. Everyone was intent on making our stay the best it could possibly be. A nice touch, on checking in I let slip it was our anniversary when we were handed our complimentary cocktail cards (v nice touch) to welcome us. The extremely personable reception lady (from Czech Republic) must have made a mental note, because on the evening of our anniversary we were sent champagne and chocolates.The Ritz Carlton is a super luxurious hotel but at a human scale and we could find no fault at all during our stay. It was amazing to go to sleep and wake overlooking Central Park.Thanks everyone! We will be back!",Good
"The Conrad Chicago is a quiet oasis just off the Magnificent Mile. The rooms are decorated in the sleek modern style that Conrad lovers admire and the bathrooms are well appointed. It would be nice, though, if Conrad had provided an executive lounge and if the regular bathrooms had been outfitted with tubs in addition to showers. Given the cost of real estate at this location, however, it was not destined to be. Still, all in all, this is one of the best places to stay in the Loop/Near North area. The hotel has a wonderful staff, who are well trained and respond to any request. And there is a full complement of eating and drinking choices. The views from the 20th floor restaurants are spectacular.Dear Philip S, Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago and taking time from your day to write such a glowing review of your stay.

"I needed a hotel for a last minute business trip during the MWCA convention. I used HotelTonight to reserve this and paid 480/ night as that was actually decent during this peak week and lack of notice. Some of the reviews on here made me concerned, and after my stay prompted me to make an account so I could leave a review. Overall, a very decent place. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, and bathroom very nice. The toilet and shower are in the bathroom, the sink was outside in the room. I saw some reviews complaining about this, however was no big deal at all to me. Shower seemed newer than the rest of the room.

"This was my second stay in this hotel. The first was before Hurricane Katrina and the 2nd was after in 2010. We remembered having a very nice stay there before so decided to try this hotel again. The location is wonderful...right next to the trolley line (but not a noice issue...very quite). The price is very reasonable. We checked around...an excellent value in my opinion. We got a 2 room King Suite for the 3 of us. We loved everything about this room. The ceilings and windows are old-style tall...which just feels right in this city. There is lots of granite everywhere. The living room is a completely separate room so everyone had their privacy. The king bed was very comfortable. My 17 year old son said the fold out couch was pretty nice too....although he wouldn't want to share it with anyone...then again, he's 6'4 and about 210 lbs.! The breakfast was a very nice buffet, hot, and plentiful with real scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, fruit, juice...and the evening cocktails/soda and wings, chips, baked potatoes, hotdogs, veggies, dips, chicken fingers were plentiful and a great alternative to eating out again. We had a big lunch so just snack food was perfect allowing us time to enjoy the pool on the ROOF!! Parking is fenced, selfpark right next to the hotel for about 17. It is within easy walking distance of the famous Mother's...and all the traditional New Orleans favorites. When you consider the price of breakfast and the free alcoholic beverages and snacks...it is so worth the price....I think with parking included we paid about 150 tops.

Thankfully, they went to bed at a decent hour, lol. My son has to swim in EVERY single pool at EVERY hotel we stay in. The pool here is HEAVILY chorinated. Even after he showered he smelled like chlorine and you couldn't even really see the bottom.of the pool. Overall good stay. Staff is super pleasant and helpful. I wanted to thank you for sharing your feedback with us here on Tripadvisor. I will be sure to relay your concerns regarding the pool. We do test our levels multiple times per day and we have an outside company that does this for us as well. I have not received any results back that our levels were over the threshold, but we will be sure to look into it. Thank you very much for staying with us.",Good

Took the trolley that runs in front of the hotel, and got off at westlake center at the monorail station. Took the monorail to the space needle. EASY. Then came back to the monorail station and walked to the market.Had a 2 bed 2 bath room. Very nice. Best breakfast buffet. This was our third hotel in a week.

"We were in San Diego for one night visiting friends. I knew we wouldn't be in the room much so we didn't care about having a nice pool, view, etc. we just needed a clean place to sleep and that's what we got. I was a bit concerned because the hotel was either full or close to it and was quite noisy. We were in the room next to the ice machine which was really loud. By the time we got back from our evening out, about 10pm, all was quiet and we got a good night sleep. The room was nothing special but clean and suited our needs. The tv remote only worked by pushing the numbers for the channels but we survived. Breakfast is included.Thank you for taking the time to write a review.I am very glad to see that you enjoyed your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay and were happy with the cleanliness of your room.

"My wife and I stayed a long weekend for the New Orleans Bowl. We read the reviews and booked this hotel kind of at the last minute.We had a room on the 4th floor which came with an outdoor, rooftop patio type space.Be aware that the hotel is still working on updating things so there is a lot of construction activity. Nothing that disturbed our stay but getting in and out, parking, and dust are things to consider. Parking was a challenge until we found the lot across the street for 30/day. If you drive a block further down on the right you may find 12/day as an FYI. The entry area has been moved so unloading and getting in/out is a challenge. The check in area is nice but quite dusty still as is the elevator and some of the halls and room.The room was very nice. We loved the exposed brick and wood joists. Very comfy bed, fridge, coffee maker, and microwave are all in the room ready to use. The rooftop patio area was a nice surprise given the warm weather and sun that weekend!The light breakfast delivered to the room was awesome. Great tasting croissant w butter and jelly and juice/coffee are delivered at the time you specify. And they were on time too. The staff was great and I would recommend this hotel to anybody. Walking to Poydras, Canal, and the French Quarter is a matter of a few minutes. Dear SandnSun67,Thank you so much for your kind words regarding you recent stay at the St. James Hotel! We are happy to report that the entrance is back to normal and the construction in the lobby is complete!We hope to see you next time you are in New Orleans so you can experience all that we have to offer again!Warm Regards,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",Good

Location was excellent as it was close to bus stops and centrally located to most everything you would want to go and see. Staff was very helpful and polite. The only thing I would say is the breakfast was a little lame even for the choice hotel line. All three mornings we went for breakfast the food was either cold or not there at all. No butter, coffee was never full, bread items ran out and were not refilled promptly. If they could fix the breakfast problems they would get 5 stars from me.Dear Joseph P,Thank you for taking the time to write a review on your experience with us.

"I would rate this Hotel Average/Poor. Stayed for a couple nights. The Hotel is located in Fishermans Wharf, a heavily crowded area. We knew this and wanted to give it a try. Mind you, the walls are VERY thin. This was our issue. After a few long days of touring and site seeing we wanted to come back, relax, and get a good night sleep for the next day. Didn't happen. We constantly were woke by people just casually passing in the hallway and could hear every single word from our neighbors next door. Full conversation. There may have not been a wall there at all! Our room was at the very end of the second floor (request a room away from the elevators so you don't hear constant noise) BUT our room's window had a view of the second story parking lot!!! People could see RIGHT into our room! Which made us have to close the window shades the entire time for privacy! Housekeeping came VERY early, 9:15am to be exact. We were still trying to sleep from being woken up off and on all through the night. The wifi didn't work. And the power went out due to the large blackout San Fran had while we were there. Not the Hotel's fault, but no one came to let us know what was going on, either. Overall, I would not stay here again. I think it's fine for a quick night in a popular tourist area, not for relaxing. Also, they offered to park our car for 65.00 ! TIP: Two doors down to the left of the hotel, there is a self parking garage for only 30.00 We did that, instead.",Bad
"Great building and breakfast but avoid rooms 12, 20 and 36. They are advertised as double rooms but are tiny compact rooms which are only suitable for one adult and have no room comforts. Not even room for a small chair.So sorry you found the cozy rooms too tiny. We would have gladly taken care of you if we had not been fully booked. Kind regards, Marty",Neutral
"Travelled with my partner to Seattle for the first time in July 2013, and after researching around on Tripadvisor and compare notes with other websites, we decided to pick Sorrento Hotel. And we did not regret it! :)It set a good start for our Seattle trip - we arrived a few hours earlier than the usual check-in time, and when we approached the reception to check-in, we were told we can do so right away - that put a HUGE smile on our face, since we've been up since 5am to catch our flight and we were totally worn out! Excellent customer service!This is an updated classic semi-luxurious hotel - I personally love the building, the hotel classic decor and settings, the room is updated and yet classy, clean, spacious and unlike other old hotels, it does not have that 'moldy' carpet smell. The room comes with your own freshly ground coffee and french-press.:)The location is great - within walking distance to literally everywhere. We walked to a whole lot of places, i.e. Pike Market, Capitol Hill, etc... we even walked all the way to the Space Needle!There's a li'l bar inside the hotel and I did enjoy a couple cocktails there. There's also a bar across the street called Quarter Lounge, check it out. And if you need pharmacy or coffee fix, they are all along the Main St right outside the hotel. Very convenient.Hope this helps. :)Wow! Thank you for such a great review.So glad you enjoyed your stay! Hope to see you again soon.Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel",Good

"What a disappointing stay- fell far below expectations, which weren't so high to begin with. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. Otherwise, I found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.The room was comfortable and generally fine, in terms of condition, apart from the surprising lack of a safe! Having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. The room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. Surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingBut my biggest beef was the breakfast, which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. Two of the three mornings, there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. The overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.",Bad

"My family and I were at the days inn for 5 days. We had 3 different rooms during this stay. Each room had a different problem. The first room the airconditioner leaked all over the rug. The second room had a leak into the bathroom light. The third room the airconditioner hardly worked at all. Each room was filthy. I seen either dead roaches or live roaches in each room. I know florida has bug problems but the hotel should have an exterminator on the premises. The hotel also needs more cleaning staff.

"Stayed here due to flight change and required a hotel for one night. Joined the membership program that offers a cheaper rate. Early check in was permitted and much appreciated after overnight flight, the front desk/ check in staff were fabulous with a friendly and informative attitude. We stayed in a corner suite room that was spacious and well appointed with a separate living area and large bedroom that also had a really nice bathroom with shower and bath. It was a lower floor overlooking the pool area-the pool itself was a shallow toddler type design with a slightly deeper jacuzzi attached. It was still popular with sunbathers but unfortunately you can't actually swim. The hotel had live loud music the night we stayed and was clearly audible until around 1030 at night. Higher floors or a room on opposite side of pool would avoid this. Overall a great stay here and even though it didn't have a balcony I'd definitely stay here again. The bed was super comfortable so a great night's sleep was achieved. Hi Nathan T,Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach.

Here are some tips/info you should know: It is right across the street from a facility where the homeless get services they are always hanging out there. The closest BART station, Civic Center, pops up in the middle of what could be called a homeless tent city. As a woman with 3 children traveling with me, all wheeling airport bags, we were very out of place walking to the hotel the kids were terrified. I felt much safer walking to the hotel from the west side-Van Ness street where there is great access to public transport.I wouldn't rule out going back to the Monarch on another trip if I needed a budget hotel, but I wouldn't bring kids there I'm not sure I'd go alone.Erica H,Thank for such a well-thought out and kind review.

"Stayed here for 3 nights recently and first time at this hotel. This is a great location and we were upgraded to a lovely room overlooking Central Park. The location is convenient to shops, restaurants and theaters. Front desk staff are courteous and accomodating as well as the bell and doormen and the rooms are beautufully appointed and spotlessly clean. The Club Lounge was very disappointing, though, from the standpoint of service and amenities. I have been to RC club lounges all over the world so in comparison this one rates at the very bottom. First, the staff seem more inclined to converse with each other than anticipate and serve the customer. For example, they were very slow to clean up tables, replace food items, or bring requested items (that are not out of the ordinary such as expresso, gluten free bread, plain yogurt). No anticipation of the guest's needs-just a total sense of uncaring and complacency. In fact, on my third morning for breakfast, i asked for these items for the third time and was greeted with a reluctant acknowledgement plus I overheard the concierge make a snide remark to the servers. As a female executive traveling often, I have never encountered this in an RC club lounge previously. My gluten free bread arrived with one heal of the bread loaf, quite shameful in a 5 star hotel. Overall, in spite of the lovely location and beautiful rooms, this experience does not compel me to return nor recommend to my business colleagues. There are plenty of other excellent hotels in NYC who will appreciate your business.Thank you for being our guest this weekend and for taking your time to complete a Review of the hotel. I am glad that you found the location and quality of the hotel to be wonderful - but I am sorry that your club experience was not as you expected. I have reviewed your comments with my team.I was pleased to find out that you were given a 300 credit at check out to compensate for the experience. I have reviewed your room bill and do see that the credit has gone through and should be reflected in your American Express Statement.Thank you once again for staying wiht us.

"So The Chelsea is running an excellent ruse...you walk in to the lobby, which is sleek, shiny, modern and fab. You are checked in by excellent staff and then you are directed to the Annex..The Annex is an horrible shabby motel, decor is straight out of the 70's, the room was slightly grubby and the bathroom made me shudder. The drawers on the unit in the bedroom kept sliding open and hitting you if you happened to be passing. The door to our room had a 2inch gap, so you got cold air in the room and every single sound from the corridor.They do not advertise the Annex the way it should be advertised, they make out it is the same as the rest of the Chelsea. The exorbitant New Year's Eve rate is a disgrace for that room - I would have gone to the Motel across the street, had I realised I would be staying in a motel anyway",Bad
"My wife and I decided to take a vacation to Seattle. Apparently, the entire population of North America had the same idea. The closest I could get to downtown was this SpringHill Suites. I wish we'd just chosen another city or another time.The suite was small, as with all such hotels of this sort, but was clean. As other reviewers have pointed out, there was some noise. The breakfast was excellent. The bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were abominable--even the replacements we asked them to give us. Free internet access was nice. Our main problem--it was a half- to three-quarter mile walk to any really decent restaurant. And the walk led through a questionable neighborhood. I was negatively impressed by the location, and would not stay here again.Oh, yes. We had a car (parked at 20 per night), but parking in downtown Seattle is a proble,, and quite expensive.",Bad

"Wasn't sure what to expect here. I just needed something relatively cheap for a night and it was so expensive downtown. Based on the reviews that I thought were unbiased, I decided to give this a try. Obviously the worst thing about it really is location. It can be down right frightening even. Alone, under a bridge basically. I can see where people would be freaked out. No doubt I wouldn't bring family or a date here. But the check in was friendly. The room was very basic but clean. I could park right outside my door. The A/C worked great. The bed was alright. I dare say comfortable although the sheets didn't exactly fit snug. I had a non-smoking room and I couldn't smell any major lingering smoke smell from any past use which is better than some other budget hotels. Needless to say, this wouldn't be my go-to hotel, but now that I've stayed at it, I would definitely consider it as a backup hotel and if I were solo again. So I feel better about possible future stays. And it was nice that there was a nice bright lit and friendly Raising Cane's nearby. I'm rating it average because that's basically what it is. It's a basic average motel and if you're expecting anything more than that, then you shouldn't be looking here.",Neutral

"We opted to return our rental car a day early and spend the night before our trip to Canada at the Fairfield. That was a great decision! Since we are not familiar with the area, I was not looking forward to the drive before our 10:30 am flight, returning the car, etc. Instead, we slept in, had a perfectly stress free breakfast and the shuttle took us to the airport. The room was spacious. The bathroom very comfortable, as was our king size bed.Thank you for making Fairfield Inn/Marriott your choice hotel, thank you for taking the time to give us your honest feedback .

"The room was nice and modern. Parking is VERY limited and hard to get to. If you don't get parking in their small garage, then you have to pay for parking across the street. There is only a very small area to park your car to even check in and no valet is available. The reception desk seems cold and not very welcoming.

"We got a couple of connecting suites, very confortable and with all the necesary ammenities. Stayed there for a week. Contemporary and stylish.What we liked the most was the location right in the middle of down town where there is a good array of restaurants, its close to the Glass Lamp area and to the trolley.Service was very kind at all times. The food was ok but for some reason lacking a bit in salt to our latino taste buds. But the coffee great. Restaurant open at all times which is practical.One thing that should be handled is the dirty windows from the outside. That takes away from the aesthetics.I definitely give it a thumbs up because its a good value for the money.It sounds like the perfect vacation at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse!

"We brought my elderly mother-in-law to Seattle for the weekend. The hotel was perfect for our weekend events. We were able to pull right up to the front door to unload. The room was absolutely perfect. It was big clean. We had a 2 bedroom unit which was perfect for privacy yet allowed us to be nearby. The bed was super comfortable we loved having 48flat screens in each room. The room was bright sunny we enjoyed being able to open the window. We requested a shower chair it was promptly brought to the room. Breakfast was great I was able to bring a tray of healthy options upstairs too. We enjoyed the work out facility it was bright clean had all of the equipment that we usually use. The location was beautiful easy to get to. we can't wait to stay again!Thank you for your feedback. It is so nice to hear that you enjoyed our hotel and were able to use our amenities as well. We look forward to your return visit.Kind Regards,",Good
"The Pearl is a first rate little hotel at which the staff and management obviously care about what they do. They kindly allowed me to stash a piece of luggage there two weeks in advance of my stay and they had it waiting for me in my room upon my arrival. Check in took all of two minutes and the host was friendly and efficient. Both the wake up call and taxi I asked for were expedited without worry. The room was large enough, spotless and had a warm charm with a comfortable bed. The plumbing and shower pressure were excellent. I can't comment as to whether it was noisy since I was tired enough to have slept through anything. I got a bite to eat at the bar and the food was tasty and served up by a helpful and polite barman. If you stay at the Pearl you won't be disappointed but be aware that you'll be charged for the boxes of water you drink that are provided in your room.Thank you very, very much for your great review. We are so honored that you chose The Pearl. Words cannot express our gratitude. Look forward to seeing you in the near future! Make it a great day.",Good

Design is simple, comfortable, inventive, tasteful...and just cool. Arrived late Friday night to a busy bar- this place is happening, which we loved! We had a drink and then went to our room (23), a little worried if it would be loud, and were pleasantly surprised that it was not. Slept like a log in the amazingly comfortable bed.Had a wonderful dinner Saturday night - this place makes the best soups, the best burger and the best beignets ever! But what really sets this place apart is the service, from the front desk, to the bar, to the restaurant...they seem genuinely interested in making sure you have a great, fun stay.Will be back...Appreciate you detailed review!!!!!!!. Glad you had a great time. Will share your review with the entire Pearl staff. You are 100 correct, our staff truly values and cares about our guests.

"This is the best place to stay if you're planning to visit downtown Chicago. Calling for a cab is not needed as both locals and visitors walk all over the place. If you go north, walk cross the Chicago river and you'll end up in the Magnificent Mile. If you head southwest, you'll end up in the Loop where the elevated train tracks circle around this part of the neighborhood.

"I booked a room at the Ramada Limited Downtown San Francisco for 4 nights (19-23 May 2007) six months in advance at a room rate of 113 per night plus tax. The advertisement stated that there was free continental breakfast, free wireless internet in the rooms, refurbished large rooms, free coffee makers, etc. Despite having booked well in advance I did not get a room in the hotel but rather in the annex and at the same room rate. The annex was across the street and partway down the block and this was not at all like what was advertised.1 There were no elevators. I had to carry my bags up several fights of stairs to get to the room.2 The room was tiny (9 x 13 feet) and had only a single twin bed. My confirmation was for a queen-sized bed.3 The room was dark because the light bulbs had been removed from the lamps and the overhead light was dim. The carpet was filthy, so perhaps this was deliberate.4 There was no internet access. There might have been access if you walked back across the street and down the block to the main building and then stood in the lobby but I did not try this,5 The continental breakfast was only available to guests in the main building according to Samir, the desk clerk.6 There was no coffee or coffee maker.7 There was no bathtub - only a small shower stall. In any case, it would be ill advised to take a shower because only two thin hand towels were provided for guests making it impossible to dry off.8 The air conditioner was broken. It was running but not cooling and all of the knobs had been removed so it was impossible to adjust any settings. Perhaps for this reason, the room had a foul odor.I returned to the main building, it was now about 3.30 PM, and I asked Samir for a different room - similar to what was advertised when I booked the room. He told me this was impossible. I then told him that I would not be using the room and I would find other accommodations and he told me that my credit card would still be billed the full amount because I had already checked in. I returned to my room down the street and I called Ramada customer service telephone support and a nice fellow named Jason (I believe) agreed that this was a problem but he said that all Ramada properties are independently owned and thus he could do nothing for me. He gave me the name of the manager of this property and suggested that I keep trying to contact him directly.I packed an overnight bag and left my luggage in the room as I did not want to haul it down the stairs and around the city looking for another room and I was going to be charged for the room anyway. I stayed in the Marriott that night and retuned the next day to check out of the Ramada. At the desk was the acting manager, Bobbie, who explained that the manager, Mr. Monday, was in Indonesia. Bobbie had not been told anything about my problem but he quickly found me an acceptable room in the main building and helped me move my bags so I completed my stay at the Ramada. In compensation for my problems and having to take a room at the Marriott the first night he took 12.90 (!) off my total bill of 515.76 (not very impressive).I am extremely dissatisfied by this affair. The property is not as advertised and the price is far in excess for similar rooms in the city. Indeed, the room I was given in the annex was dangerous and uninhabitable. The Ramada staff at the hotel were unwilling to help until I was about to leave early, the telephone support from Ramada was unable to help resolve this problem.",Bad

"We visited this hotel after booking online for a short weekend visit. The hotel is quite lovely and our room was very clean and cozy. We got a petite room and it was fine for the two of us as we don't require a lot of space. The entire hotel was very clean and the pool and lobby were beautiful. Our check in was fine and we valeted our car for the night. The next morning we called down 20 minutes early as instructed for the retrieval of our car. After 45 minutes of waiting we inquired at the desk to find out what the issue was. We were told they were on it and it would be soon. At that point, we realized the six other ppl standing around were also waiting for cars. They had one valet and he brought 2 cars that no one needed while we were all waiting. Two hours went by and the lobby became packed. Two bellhops were sitting in chairs not doing a thing. At one point, the one was sitting in a guest chair while guests were standing and he began to sleep. We inquired a second time and told the same thing with no apologies at any point. It turned out to be an over two hour wait for a car that was parked in a lot behind the hotel. We even asked for our keys so that we could get it ourselves and they told us the valet had the keys and this wasn't possible. After that we decided to park our own car and not use their valet. We told the front desk and she said that was fine and she removed the charge for our earlier inconvenience. We parked in the same lot and saved 4 by doing so. The night before check out, we asked if we could go ahead and checkout then since our flight was at 4am the next day. She told us no and their would be someone on staff at our departure time to take care of it. Frustrating, but we figured it was policy.The next morning, we got to the desk and the check out clerk told us that all computers were down and there was nothing she could do.Arriving at the airport, we received our final invoice and noticed that they not only charged us for the valet service that they said they removed, they charged us for every night that we self parked. We called and told there was nothing that they could do at that time because the person who removed the valet charge was on vacation and no manager was on duty. Also, we were disconnected during this conversation and had to call back several times because the phone was ringing busy after our disconnection. Four hours later, we were sent a corrected bill via email. No call, no apology, no customer service skills what so over. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they would like to be treated like their business does not matter. Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn for your New Orleans stay and taking the time to share your experience. Your kind comments about our historic hotel are appreciated. We typically receive high marks for our customer service - apologize we missed the mark during your stay. We are sorry for the difficulties you experienced with our valet service.

"My son and I visited this hotel for the first time last month. We only stayed for one night. I booked our room on priceline.com using the Name Your Own Price tool. I feel like we got a decent deal for what we received. There is no way I'd pay full price for this hotel though. When we arrived to the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised that they don't charge for parking. Most hotels charge outrageous parking fees even if you're self parking. The first room they assigned to us was on the 8th floor. We went and checked into our room around 6pm and then went back out to get dinner. The room was pretty warm when we got into it, so I lowered the A/C down to the lowest setting of 65 degrees. I figured it would cool off while we were out over the next couple of hours. When we returned to the hotel around 8pm, the room was still way too warm. It was obvious that the air conditioning wasn't working properly. I cannot sleep in a hot room at all. So we packed up our stuff and walked down to the front desk. I tell them our A/C isn't working and they offered to send in the maintenance crew to look at it. I didn't want to have to wait and fool with this issue, so I asked to be transferred to another room. They obliged and gave us a new room on the 8th floor almost next door the one we had. Upon entering, this room was warm also. I turned the A/C as high as it would go and it seemed to be cooling better than the first room. An hour later, the room is still too warm for me. I called down to the front desk and told them and they sent maintenance up to the room. They were able to do something to the unit in the room and it did cool off the air a bit more. At bedtime it was still too warm for me, so I called down and asked for a box fan. NOPE. They do not offer fans to their guests. So I had to sleep in a warm room with just a sheet. The walls at this hotel are very thin. We could hear people out in the hallway that night, as well as the following morning. The only thing I liked about this hotel was the pool and hot tub amenities. They have an indoor pool and hot tub. I think they have an outdoor pool also, but it was closed due to cold weather. They also have a sauna and steam room, which was nice. I have stayed in better hotels in this area. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends and family. If I were in a pinch, I could staying here, but if I have a choice, I wouldn't.I am sorry to learn of your discomfort while staying with us.

"This place is a Marriott but I've stayed at Courtyards that were nicer than this dump. This place should be re-branded to a lower quality Marriott Property. When I see that a property is a Marriott (and not a Residence Inn, Fairfield, Courtyard, etc) I believe it is a NICE place with HIGH QUALITY standards. This property was not that.Room was okay. Nothing special. The room was overpriced by about double for the property.Breakfast was fine, the buffet is priced similarly to other Marriotts. Coffee was average.Location is near Little Italy and the Medical school. Not an awesome part of town and the property matches the neighborhood (not awesome). It's not the ghetto but there are definitely nicer looking areas in Chicago.I will not stay here next time I'm in Chicago.

"What started out as a special weekend away for my boyfriend's birthday turned into a disaster. My boyfriend is a law enforcement officer and he and I reside in Highlands County which was the 2nd worst damaged county in Florida from Hurricane Irma. Since he was working mandatory overtime and we were without power for many days, I thought I would use my Hilton Honors points to find a hotel for our getaway.. Which is where I found your Homewood Suites. Upon checking in on Friday 9/22/17 we were greeted by the front desk clerk.. She was EXTREMELY nice and continued to deliver top notch services for us. We went to our room and discovered that we were given the keys for a double queen room. The beds were NOT true queen size.. We went back to the front desk with out luggage and when I explained that I reserved a King suite, we were told that there were not any King suites available, as they overbooked. I travel A LOT for work and I was surprised about this, and I felt that maybe they should have offered us a room next door to the Hilton Garden. We were not. The clerk re-assigned us to a 1st floor 2 queen and she said the manager would be checking with Hilton Honors to see what happened. She assured us she would leave a message for us after she found out what was wrong. After dinner and errands, we came back and there was no message, so I called Hilton Honors and they 3 way called the hotel and they said that they would offer us a room at Hilton Garden.. Well it was late at night, everything was unpacked and I did not want to go next door. Then almost immediately we were told that a King Suite just happened to come available, so we relocated to the King suite. That was 3 rooms in one night! The King suite was certainly not a King bed.. more like a queen. We woke up in the morning and went to the lobby for the hot breakfast (which was another reason I selected your hotel). The breakfast was not very good, eggs tasted funny and the sausages were not cooked all the way, and my boyfriend got sick, and my stomach didn't feel great either. Once we felt better we went out to Disney and enjoyed the EPCOT festival. When we came back to the hotel..hot and tired, we went into the room at 3:30 ish and the room had NOT been cleaned. I called down to get more towels so we could shower, which the front desk clerk had brought to the room and was so wonderful and apologetic. Housekeeping showed up at 6:30 pm after we were settled for the night. After showering I made the bed and discovered that there was not a blanket on the bed..it was a mattress pad..which explained why I was cold the previous night. We did not go to breakfast in the am and checked out. The weekend manager never spoke to us, never apologized and sent the clerk to do everything..Again the clerk was wonderful. So what started out as a wonderful surprise get away for my boyfriend turned out to be disappointing. I have been a Hilton Honors member since 2010 and I travel for work at least a couple times a month. I have never been so disappointed in a Hilton property as I was at your hotel. To make matters worse I found that I was double charged on my credit card today.. I had to spend an hour on the phone trying to get it straightened out.",Bad
"Great little hotel bordering waterfront area and French Quarter. Close to all the action, actually right in the middle of it, but somehow not loud or in-your-face. Staff was super-helpful, receptionists were sweet, efficient. Doorman always helpful and had kind good morning words ready for us. Our room was large, had architecturally interesting details. I told them while making reservations that my friend was an architect, and they picked this room especially for us - thank you! Small pool that we didn't use, but other people had drinks out by pool area and they looked very relaxed.",Good
"We came as a group on business. The rooms are large, there is a nice desk for working, the complimentary Internet speed was ok, but I couldn't figure how to get the better speed once I had signed up for the complimentary.

I should've believed what I read here about the spire elite benefits in this hotel. Basically nothing! Got no upgrade on the room.

"The hotel is well located for Central SF, we walked to Union Square and if you can take the hills Fisherman's Wharf isn't too far, and of course Hyde Street is on the Cable Car network, although not the section right outside the hotel. It is an old historic building with a lot of character but we did find our room to be very cramped particularly compared to everything else we stayed in on our trip. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly and breakfast was fine. The stair carpets were pretty dirty but as decorating works were underway I guess they're due for cleaning or changing once this has finished.The only other moan I have about this hotel is the pet policy ( it allows them). This is a compact inner city hotel with no outside space and seems unsuitable for pets ( dogs usually). When we were there a guest brought their dog into the breakfast room and later the same dog dumped a pile of you know what on the stairs. Yes this is down to an irresponsible owner but does show that a review of this policy may be needed.Would I go back again, you bet, even with the negatives it's good value and SF is a great city but next time I'll remember my hat, scarf, coat and gloves!",Neutral
"I come to Vegas often on business and the strip is exhausting. The element is a new, clean and quiet hotel. The staff was so friendly, and Sergio at the front desk made you feel like he would do anything for you. The rooms are large and comfortable and most even have their own kitchen.",Good

Located right across the street from the Space Needle it's a great choice to stay in Seattle. Downtown is just a couple of minutes driving or 15 minutes walking.Our room had a small kitchen but the only bad thing is that aparently you need to bring your own pillows if you want to rest properly because the ones they have are terrible.,Good

"We stayed here for a week during a Disneyland visit in June. The staff was very helpful. The continental breakfast was filling, but Denny's and IHOP are just a few steps away if you choose to sleep in. The rooms are large and clean.

"We recently hosted our daughter's wedding in NOLA and wanted a more intimate setting for guests. We could not have been happier. The location was a short walk to everything you would want to see and do in the French Quarter and easy access to Canal Street shops. The rooms were large quiet and comfortable. Best of all was the service. Beverly and Cynthia at the front desk bent over backwards for our group and felt like part of the family by the end of our stay. If you want to be in the heart of New Orleans without the craziness of the Quarter, the Bienville House is the perfect boutique hotel for you.Thank you so much for your comments about the luxury service you received at the Bienville House!

This was a lovely hotel. The staff were super friendly and very helpful. We received a complimentary upgrade to a king room and the bed was so comfortable. The hotel was in a good location- found it to be quiet and out of the way however was still in walking distance to shopping and restaurants. The business centre offers free internet (you get 20 minutes every 24 hours) which was handy because I didn't have my own laptop. I would definitely stay here again.,Good

"Stayed as part of our honeymoon trip for 3 nights. Checked about 10pm, wasnt the most friendly of greetings but hey. Had requested a high floor room, would have been nice to be wished a happy honeymoon but never mind. Asked when checking in if we had to pay for a safe or if it was in the room as we had a lot of flight tickets, money, credit cards, passports, iPads etc with it being a long trip, told it was in the room. Got to the room, no safe, rang down and spoke to the guy who checked us in who said oh yeah there is no safe in that room, a bit exhausting after a long flight from NY. Moved rooms which was fine, a bit small so no space for our luggage but a good spacious bathroom and the room was modern and clean. Reception staff quite disappointing, I have worked in hospitality and it wouldnt take much to say:- youve obviously just arrived, do you need help with eating tonight - we had never been to the city and being 10pm at night were unsure of where to go- we dont serve breakfast, do you need some recommendations- (when checking out with 4 suitcases) do you need a taxiNot much of an effort to help make our stay a little easierGood location, nice hotel, few niggles let it down",Good
Stayed for 2 1/2 months this summer. Great breakfast variety. Friendly staff. Very comfortable king suite. Restaurant's are within walking distance. Dinner social's a plus! Free washers and dryers also.,Good
The exterior of the building looks very nice...the rooms don't feel that way however. There was chipped counters and mismatched furniture. For what I paid I should have had a better set up. This place is gross and I will never stay there again.,Bad
"Excellent rooms, excellent service, nice people, great location, Parking is cheap for SF with in and out privileges. Beautiful public places, fine breakfast. 50 feet from China town, 5 blocks from the north end, three blocks from Union Square, not far from museums and Mosconi center. Powell Street cable car to Fisherman's Wharf is 3 blocks.

"To me both a central location and my experience as a guest drive my selection of a hotel. Oh and the comfort of the beds too! Hotel Nikko has all this and more. Location is perfect, near Union Square and shopping. It is also very well situated to Bart, the subway, this makes it even easier to get around the city. We had thought that we would take the car out a couple of times, though we never did, it was just as easy to use public transportation or use our 2 feet. The only caution, and this would be throughout the city, is parking costs, so don't be shocked with the fee! I will say the valet was superb. They were swift and efficient and responsive to our requests. From the moment you step into this hotel you are welcomed. The hotel is beautiful and stylish. The check-in is thorough and not rushed, you are offered a glass of wine or if you prefer there is always iced cucumber or lemon water available in the lobby. It is these many details that cause me to take a moment to relax and enjoy my surroundings especially in a busy city. You feel cared about and to me that makes a difference. The staff are professionals, they are friendly, you are treated well, and oh, you have a great shower, so there you have it, enjoy!Dear ProudCalifNativeThank you so much for your recent review and for staying with us. We appreciate the perfect score! You mentioned so many items that made your stay memorable. I am glad the wine and water at the reception desk made you feel welcome.

"My wife and I stayed for 2 days at the hotel. The hotel is very nice and the staff were very kindly and helpfull. Looking by the photos i believed that they had access to the beach, but it is a bay view. We seated at the chairs on the bay view area and ordered food...it was everything all right then suddenly a iguanas gang came attacked all the food. I think it was about 3 or 4 of them, and nothing that i could do stop them kkkkk. It was so bizarre that we decided to get out and go to the city.Dear Guest, Thank you for your review of Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. Your constructive comments are extremely important to us. I sincerely apologize for the unfortunate and rare encounter you had with iguanas on our private beach.

"I was looking forward to giving this hotel an amazing review, but I can't our last night was the worst! I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work, but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610,Thank you for your detailed review of the amenities and the friendly staff that assisted you throughout your stay. I have passed on your compliments to Sean and I want thank you for the opportunity you gave me to resolve your issue.

Per our conversation please reach out to me in the future for reservations if your travels lead you back to San Francisco.Regards,Jaime",Neutral
"A standard upper end business hotel with some Conrad touches, not many. Nothing like Tokyo or Hong Kong. Missing charm and some finishing touches. The rooms are strictly utilitarian. Quiet, comfortable bed, decent coffee maker. Bathroom had no bathtub. Space wasted with huge sink area. Couch was IKEA-like and side table on one side of bed like a lost child. Nothing on it, no reason to be there. Closet was awkwardly placed. The lobby was dramatic but the rooms did not match. Hotel is right off Michigan Ave., close to shops. Its better than the Intercontinental but not in the same class as the Ritz or Four Seasons. Looking for a touch of elegance in the Hilton chain stay at the nearby Waldorf.Dear kev1438, Thank you for choosing the Conrad Chicago and taking time to write a review of your experience. We appreciate the feedback but am sorry you did not find our rooms luxurious and our furnishings lacking. I hope the service you experienced during your stay was helpful and accommodating and we thank you for your feedback.",Good
"We loved this place. Lovely inner courtyard for coffee or breakfast from PJs next door or Johnny's around the corner. Rooms are tiny - no doing your yoga in these rooms. But the location is right on, and it's clean and quiet in the middle of NOLA noise. Staff was also awesome. Pool has a fence and gates to accommodate families with kids who can't swim, but beware of guests and staff who leave one of the gates open.

"How can you beat a champagne welcome before going to your quiet, comfy, updated room that is close to great shopping, great restaurants and the theater, not to mention an easy walk to business appointments in the financial district. I'd read other reviews of the hotel, so I requested a room on a low floor in a quiet spot. The wonderful, friendly desk staff were very accommodating and put me on the second floor, which allowed me to take the stairway to the lobby. I was a little concerned about the bed, having read other reviews. No worries, the bed was very comfortable, not too hard at all. The room was updated and appointed well. While I'm sure there are some small rooms in the hotel - after all it is San Francisco - the one I had was a perfect size. The bathroom was tiny - after all it is San Francisco - but remodeled and clean. Across from the theater, two blocks down from Union Square and some of the best shopping in the world, any type of food you can imagine within a few blocks.Thank you very much for sharing this great feedback on your recent stay with us!

"We stayed on this time share property thru a family member. We stayed on a corner 2 bedroom suite with views of other casino buildings on the strip. Check-in and out was quick with no lines. Staff members are friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and has all the amenities for a typical condo time share property. My kids did not attend the children's program /play ground but we always see kids with attendants on the play area every morning from our room. The pool was small and I wish it was larger considering that it is a time share property and most of their guests are families with kids. Parking (valet only) is free which is great considering that MGM properties on the strip charged for parking. My main complaint is the long wait for getting our car. We always waited for at least 15 minutes or longer to get our car. The longest was during our check our which is around 10:00 AM when we waited at least 40 minutes, I guess its the check out time.We are delighted that you found our associates friendly and accommodating. We appreciate your feedback of your stay. Thank you for your perfect review of Marriott's Grand Chateau.",Good
"Can't say anything bad about Sleep Inn Convention Center. Very clean room, comfy beds and good customer service. Breakfast was modest but very good. Served in a small area though so make sure that you're not late. Two important (and I believe useful) notes - there's only Family restaurant close by and a small grocery y store at Gas station.The good thing is that the Hotel is located on International drive and there is a I-Ride Trolley station next to the hotel. There are lots of dining, shopping places, attractions and major sea parks on International drive and I-Ride trolley can take you there for only 1.25 per person. That was very convenient!Not the best shuttle bus to theme parks though (small and full).",Neutral

It's not always the nicest of rooms and it can get noisy at nice, but it serves the purpose for when I'm travelling for business since I don't need a car or the Marta to get around town.

"ed here more than once and when I arrived I am always acknowledged by my name. From the time I was greeted at the font desk by jovial, sweet and friendly Monique I am always glad to get to my room after a long trip where being a Hilton Honors member really pays. Michael is wonderful. I swear he can do 8 things at once! He has helped me with the computer at late hours when I couldn't figure out how to print/fax, etc.My most recent stay I lost my Samsung Fit. I didn't know if I lost it in the hall, or where. I looked everywhere and housekeeping helped me also. They know my phone number and I let them know that I lost it last week. I received a phone call from Michael that Shaunta found it and they actually have an HONEST staff that called and e mailed me to let me know. What a refreshing experience. Shaunte found it and Karen (who is awesome) wanted to know where to mail it to since they know I travel the world. Monique,Shaunte and Karen and Michael and I know I am missing a lot of the rest of the staffs names. I have NEVER had a bad experience and can't thank them enough. The first time I stayed there they overachieved my expectations. Karen went the extra mile with faxing a 23 page fax that only had 22 pages go through. She re sent it and I had a flight to catch. When I landed she had left me a voice mail that it had went through. Who does that!!!I will NEVER stay anywhere else in Philly since I found them. They are the best!",Good
"The hotel were helpful assisting us with questions before our stay, and we're happy to let us leave our car and luggage for the full day before checking in so that we could enjoy the day at Disney. The managers / owners () were really friendly and gave great service. The room was clean,spacious and modern with more facilities (fridge, coffee maker and microwave) than some 4 star hotels we stayed in on our trip. It was a 15-20 min walk to Disney which was really convenient and there is a shuttle bus which stops outside. I would happily recommend this hotel to family and friends",Good

"This is old hotel located on a loud main road. Don't look for a good nights sleep here because of the noise from cars racing up and down the street. Other noise makers were the garbage truck is there at 7:00 am and someone was running a jack hammer around the same time. The curtain was ripped. Trim limbs falling on cars. The pastries for the continental breakfast were stale and only bananas were there for the fruit. Coffee taste like old motor oil.Dear Janet,Thank you for taking a moment to provide your valuable feedback. We would like to apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations or our standards. We are truly sorry the outside noise level was distracting. We will certainly look into your concerns regarding breakfast and the parking lot tree limbs as our goal is to provide each guest with a safe and enjoyable experience. Again, thank you for your time and feedback.",Bad

"Lets start with the the check in process --GREAT people easy check in! Staff is very nice and helpful,The room is an average room--small and tight but that is normal for New Orleans, Walls are paper thin and the first night of our neighbors screamed and fought and had to call security,Also the door has a 1 gap on the bottom with light and noise pouring in! Used pillows at night to block (not so good)Bed creaks and is hard to get up without waking everyone else .Maid service is TERRIBLE!!! First night coming back to room we were missing all the cups, all the coffees, all the teas, no bathmat, no washrags, and no kleenex.Second night returning to the room at 5 pm---room was not touched--had to call front desk and they said O No the maids were running behind.Maid Mng said they would be over at 6:30 to do room. We left at 6.Came back at 11pm and sure the maid came in and straightened the bed.And that is all they did.......This time there was no cups, no coffee, no tea, no bathmat, and both trashcans were overfilled and not empty and no toilet paper.Again I called down to front desk and requested things brought to my room--front desk clerk asked (testily) what do we need right away (she sounded very put out)Today I will speak with a manager and hopefully all of the other rooms our friends are in are not suffering this poor service and attitude.Dear Richard b,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay. Let me apologize on behalf of my staff for the housekeeping and front desk clerk issues that you experienced. There is never an excuse to respond to your needs while here at the hotel. Please forgive us as what your experience did not meet your standards or our own. As I reviewed these comments with our staff, I discovered that our Assistant GM has spoken with you and hopefully helped to resolve any issues we could at this point. We have used your experience as a learning tool in order to find ways to make improvements. The service that you received is simply unacceptable.

"Don't believe this is a 3+ star property. While the room was clean enough, the entire facility is in need of a complete renovation.We were very disappointed as we had a week reservation.My first clue that this was going to be sub-Best Western standards was the fact that their airport shuttle was unavailable for when we were arriving.I will say the hot tub was certainly hot enough and other than the foam that was created when the jets were on(add some more soda ash), was very nice.I am glad we really only slept here as we were about town for most of our stay.Dear Brian: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candid feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. Exciting things are yet to come, as we are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, which includes our onsite restaurant Seven Seas Caf, and our infamous Zacks Bar.

"Sorry for not sharing the excitement of previous reviewers... We spent 6 nights in this hotel, which we chose based on the reviews here, and were not very happy. I'll try to break in down to pros and cons:Pros:- It is a decent, well-maintained property. - Housekeeping was great, the room was very clean and the grounds are beautifully landscaped.- Breakfast was better than expected, had a wide selection and kept us (and kids) happy for the first half of the day.- Most of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful, especially the front desk manager.Cons:- Location!! The hotel is located in a remote, not-so-good part of town (not a bad neighborhood, just a commercial street dotted with hookah lounges and pawn shops). Getting anywhere in the city took about 20 minutes drive and was quite frustrating.- The room, although spacious and comfy, does NOT contain fridge and/or microwave, which made it difficult to stay with kids.- They charge for cribs in the room - 5 per crib per night, which would add up to quite a hefty amount. We have been traveling with young kids for the past 6 years, and this is the first time we were charged for crib. On checkout, when the front desk lady asked if everything was ok, I said that I was unhappy with this extra charge - she just shrugged and said it was the manager's decision. Great.To sum it up: for families with young kids like ourselves, I'd suggest not to be tempted by the reasonable price and positive reviews, but rather pay more attention to the details and choose a hotel closer to downtown.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience with the TripAdvisor community, and for choosing the Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites. Thank you for mentioning what you enjoyed about your stay your compliments are appreciated. I am truly sorry that your experience was not what you had hoped. Our goal is to exceed every guests expectations, and we take it very seriously when we fail.Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites is a AAA 2-diamond property. We tend to rate highly with those who appreciate great customer service, clean rooms and want the most for their dollar. While we do charge 5 for a crib, we also include many free amenities that you may end up having to pay for in more expensive hotels, including those in the downtown area. We offer free wireless internet, free parking, free coffee and tea all day, DVD players in all guestrooms, a thoughtfully selected free movie library, and a complimentary expanded continental breakfast that includes much more substance than a standard continental breakfast, we offer hard-boiled eggs, steel-cut oatmeal, freshly made bagels and pastries, juices and make-your-own-waffles. As you mentioned, the hotel property is very well maintained, with clean, lush, and beautifully landscaped grounds. The guestrooms are spotless, as well as spacious and comfy. We appreciate that you noticed this about our rooms. I apologize that a refrigerator was not included in your room type. We do have rooms equipped with microwaves and mini-fridges, as well as rooms with efficiency kitchens. Next time you stay, please feel free to ask for a room with a refrigerator or a full kitchen.

"This is by far the worst hotel (as opposed to motel) I have ever stayed in. I stayed in room 305, and when I tried to close the window, the window frame came away in my hand.To give you an idea of the state of the place, the metal tissue holders in the bathroom were covered with rust.Breakfast consisted of the cheapest bagels one can imagine, an apple, a blueberry muffin, some synthetic-tasting orange juice, and some mediocre coffee, with only powdered whitener - not even milk.The decoration of the room looked like it had been done by a 10 year old, it was so shabby.Finding the place in the first place, and getting there amidst all of the construction was a nightmare - although to be fair to the owners that's not their fault.What an awful first experience of Seattle - it certainly made me reticent about visiting the city again if that's in any way representative.Incidentally, this is the first review I've contributed, which indicates hiw bad this place was.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We truly value the opinions of our customers and we apologize that we did not meet your expectations. Providing our guests with the best possible hospitality and service has always been our mission. We apologize for window in your room and the furnishings that did not meet your standards. We continually strive to keep our property clean, friendly, and welcoming.

"We stayed here for two nights for the New Years Eve. The best thing about this place is its location. Right on Bourbon Street - the place where you would want to be, after coming back from Jackson Square , to celebrate the rest of NY party. The room was okay, clean, a little small. We had asked for a room with balcony on the Bourbon St when booking. But on arrival we were told that we could only get a room with its windows facing Bourbon St. (no balcony) on the 4th floor. The disappointing part was that almost the entire street view is blocked by the extended roof/shade below the window outside. The staff never informed us about this. For the price, we definitely deserved more. Our room however was safe from the street noise. The staff was very helpful and courteous. They had guards to ensure that only hotel guests had an access to the hotel (as Bourbon street can be as crazy as it can get ). So in that sense its safe as well. Kitchen opens up at 6pm for room orders.We had a cab pickup to the airport early morning at 4:30 am. The cab got delayed by 30mins owing to the crowded streets (yes even at 5am in the morning). Overall it was comfortable and was okay. A little pricey based on the room we got. Will I come back to 4 points again Maybe.",Neutral

"My wife and I recently stayed at this property for 3 nights and had a fabulous stay! The location is just a few miles south of the Orange County/Los Angeles County line. You could not ask for a better location all around! The hotel is about a half mile off of I-5 and is right across the street from Angels Stadium. One night we walked from our room to the stadium and made it there in a couple of minutes. I was a bit nervous that traffic might be bad around game time as fans are coming in but I was surprised to see no traffic at all. Disneyland is located about 1-2 miles away. The staff was nice enough to tell us a shorter way over to Disney and we were in the parking lot in under 5 minutes. The staff is top notch! I have never met a more friendly staff. All of the employees had smiles on their faces and were always very cordial and helpful. We did a lot of tourist things up in the LA and Burbank area and where able to make the drive in about 30 minutes depending on traffic. Our studio suite was fantastic! Our room felt just like an apartment! We had a king bed, living room, kitchen, desk/office area, bathroom, and large closet. The kitchen was stocked with everything except the food! We had a dishwasher, stove, and microwave. The room, just as all of the property, was very clean and our air conditioner kept our room very cool. The bathroom was rather large, my wife and I were both able to get ready at the same time without bumping into each other. The hotel offers a daily continental breakfast that is simple and good. They have 2 waffle irons, cereal, muffins, bagels, english muffins, and juices. The area does close at exactly 930 so you need to get there early. Seating is somewhat limited and the area fills up quickly. They have 2 people working to clean the area and assist guests. The one lady who seemed in charge of the area was very pleasant and friendly and was quick to come over to us every morning to welcome us back. The hotel seems to attract business travelers although there were some families there too. It was nice not to have too many kids around and to have an adult atmosphere. There are plenty of restaurants around that range from fast food and casual to fine dinning. Overall, this is a fabulous place to stay! Great location, great attractions, but most importantly a great staff!",Good
This was a weekend getaway to surprise my soon to be with a 40th celebration. The room was perfect. In fact we barely left hotel. Everything was assessible and the amenities made it a relaxing stay.

"This property is truly ACROSS THE STREET from the pedestrian walkway into the main esplanade for Disneyland and Disney California-great for tired feet at the end of the day! Many places state that they are across the street or close and then offer a shuttle on the street -if you need a shuttle- you are NOT CLOSE and sure you may be across the street ...from the backside of Disneyland...so be careful. Check in was at 3pm. Parking is in a very small lot but the lot is contained off of the street and it is Valet parking so you don't have to worry about parking the car. We were also able to access our car with no problem while we stayed there and the valet staff were very helpful and nice. The room was small in comparison to some places (true to the pictures on their website though) but big enough for us - as we were just mainly there to sleep. There was a small coffee maker and a microwave as well as a refrigerator in the room. They offer a continental breakfast but we skipped it all 4 days as we just wanted to hit the park. There is a Disneyland Annual Passholder discount here also! Our room was pretty quite and was located above the carport -we only heard screaming kids headed out in the morning and returning in the evening -no big deal. Pros: Super Close, Clean, very nice staff, grab and go breakfast if you want it, cookies at check in, newly remodeled, valet parking, there is a Denny's and an IHOP directly in front of the inn. The beds were comfy.Cons: (none of these were deal breakers for me) refrigerator wasn't very cold at check in so we adjusted it and it was fine, check in time was firmly after 3pm, they charge you a fee of 2-3 a day for use of the room safe (a keyed safe) but if you don't want to use it just tell them, parking is about 11 a day (but it is valet-so there is that)They ran out of extra pillows for the pull out sofa bed.I would stay here again in a heartbeat. :)",Good
"We stayed at this hotel during a huge cheerleading competition. When we got back into our room after a day of being done for 12 hours we found our room had not been made. I attempted to call the front desk several times but no one had answered. I sent my daughter down to ask for towels since our room was not made. My daughter then called me and said they have no towels. I told her to go back to the front desk and put me on the phone since their phones are still busy. The front desk told me that they don't make up the rooms on the weekends, which is not what was advertised on the tent card in my room, and that the hotel was completely out of towels. I told her I have 4 people in here that need to shower when will towels be available. She stated at 9 the next day when housekeep is in. I told her we need to shower then she FINALLY offered hand towels. Needless to say I have never been to a hotel where they don't clean my room and ran out of towels!! I will never ever stay here again!",Bad
"I'd like to preface by stating it's a 3.5. I booked a club room via Anerican Express platinum. We were upgraded to a deluxe room, nice. The club is definitely not worth it! Any club I've been in has more than 2 offerings a day. And definitely more than 1 on the weekends! Very disappointed. You can not go into the club and just grab a water or soda. It is locked many hours of the day on weekends. Rooms were average. Lobby average. Housekeeping did a very nice job. Just not impressed:(Thank you for staying with us and for letting us know your thoughts on our Executive Lounge. I am sorry for your disappointment.

"Just a few of the examples of how terrible: fire alarm went off and hotel needed to be evacuated. When asked what the problem was, the staff said someone turned up the thermostat in the hallway to 90-degrees (serious!! this set off the fire alarm). Workout room had a TV that wasnt working, no towels available - in fact the container that was suppose to hold clean towels and deposit used towels was being used as a trash can! There were also nothing to wipe down the exercise equipment when you were done (gross). We are disheartened to read your review. Please accept our sincere apology for the problems you encountered.

"The pictures on the internet don't do this place justice. The room was super clean, best bed I think I have ever had in a hotel and the pillow too! Nice breakfast buffet was provided. Employees were very helpful. My only concern is the ventilation system. It will not allow you to run the fan, it is on an automatic setting. I had to put it on heat and set the thermostat at 67 since it got so hot in there. If you are a light sleeper traffic might be a concern. It didn't really bother me.

"The issues started the first night. Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft. This would be fine if it was just elevator noise but every time it went up and down the banged like the someone was knocking on the door loudly. All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy, Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit, unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9, the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly, 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night, at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying. I called the office but as far as I know no one came up or called. Just not a good stay. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review.

A nice, clean and convenient place to stay!",Good

"Other than the fact that there was no real lobby this hotel was comfortable and clean. I was unaware that they were in the middle of a lobby remodel which made arriving and departing in the rain a hassle.Dear guest Jan S:I really appreciate your taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize for the inconvenience that you experienced during your arrival/departure due to our renovation. Im happy to announce that we are back to a beautiful lobby for all our guests enjoyment and we would love to welcome you again to show you our final product.We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns!. Please stay with us again soon so that we can demonstrate our commitment to exceed your satisfaction. Sincerely, Alex BlancoGeneral Manager",Good

"One can quickly tell this is an older facility. However, is close to Fisherman's Wharf and other San Francisco attractions. Our room was large and comfortable although carpet moles were obvious. Nice area on the third floor for enjoying a libation and watching the sun set over the Golden Gate Bridge. Staff are very pleasant and helpful. A free light breakfast is included. Also very nice to be at a place with free covered parking. Would stay there again! Was the first time I had seen an envelope for tips placed in the room by housekeeping staff.",Good

"The location and price of this hotel were exactly what we wanted...1 block from the BART and 2 blocks from Union Square. The hotel is very well managed, clean, and comfortable. Great showers and comfortable beds. We weren't in the hotel much as we were on a vacation and were busy running around but we looked forward to coming home to our hotel each night and finding dinner at all the local restaurants. It's centrally located to everything you'll want to see. We're very frugal people so we vetted many, many hotels. And finally settled on this one. So glad we did! Anytime we go back to San Francisco (which now we want to make a regular thing out of it) we want to stay at Hotel Abri. We even looked into their enrollment program to earn free nights...and we never do that. When we were initially debating whether to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area or Union Square, we ultimately decided we wanted to be in the city...not a tourist attraction, so we went with Union Square. It was great to visit touristy areas but come back to local life. That said, Union Square is a huge shopping mecca so you could argue that its a commercial area. But the vibe feel much more local. This hotel is like staying Union Square in NY versus sleeping in Time Square...exactly how we wanted to experience San Fran.",Good
"It's a good deal for what you get, the room I had came with 2 doubles and a sofa bed with two separate rooms, sofa bed is far from comfortable, but again, the price isnt bad in comparison. Room also had two tvs and balcony. Staff was friendly and helpful.",Neutral
"This hotel is located directly on the Promenade on Pacific Beach, which means you just need to step out of your room to be on the beach. We had a room with partial ocean view - strongly recommended! We had the swimming pool below our room, and then the ocean at a (short) distance. The room was pretty large and comfy. Breakfast and Internet access was included. The staff was also very helpful in assisting us with our trip planning. Overall, our stay at this hotel was a highly positive experience!",Good

"The rooms at this hotel sort of look like someone's attempt at an Edwardian themed hotel, only with some manky old 70s bedspreads and curtains. The staff are unfriendly and disengaged. The rooms are small and the free wifi is like dial up circa '96. You can barely open a website. Needs a damn good revamp because it clearly hasn't been decorated for 30 years. We had to ask at reception for a plug because the sink nor the bath had one. Location is fine - bus to downtown takes 10 minutes and costs 2.25 each. Plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance.",Bad

No complaints at all.Thank you for staying with us. I hope next time you can stay longer to enjoy all of our amenities. Hope to see you soon.",Good
"Came here because our first and second choices hotels weren't available. It was a nice substitute at the last minute! While it doesn't have the upscale feel of the Lodge at Torrey Pines, it was adequate for our needs. The grounds were lovely--styled to look as an old Spanish hacienda. Everything was extremely clean in fact, it felt as thought the hallways had been newly painted and wallpapers. Rooms were, frankly, not at the level of the grounds. They were clean and nicely appointed, but on the smaller side (we were in a more standard room because suites weren't available.) Our room was an upgrade from our companions', but other than a free bottle of wine, we were unable to understand why. Thus, that upgrade is not worth the additional cost unless the bottle of wine is worth it to you. I had a very pleasant experience with Brent, the concierge. He was accommodating, helpful, and took his time trying to get us the right restaurant for our needs, which were to accommodate a rather large party with specific tastes. Kudos to him.Phone service is polite, but it took a long time for every call to be answered by both the operator (on two occasions) and valet (on 2 out of 4 occasions.) Maybe not quite enough staffing. In fact, staff were almost nonexistent. Usually, you see service people and staff walking around resorts, but we didn't see any, except for the cafe, check-in, and one housekeeping person. Over 3 days/2 nights. Not a big deal, unless you need staff.I believe there is no on-site parking except valet. This may be a cost consideration.There were no noise complaints except for the doors! They slam shut, very loudly, and woke us up several times. This appeared to be the interior closet doors.One issue: tiny pillows! The sleep pillows appeared sized for a child's bed, about 2/3 the size of a normal pillow.Overall, it was a pleasant stay, and we would consider staying there again. However, at the risk of sounding like a snob, we do usually travel at a higher level, so it wouldn't be our first choice.",Good

Set up for room had good acoustics that blocked noise from the living room from filtering in from the bedroom. I gave it 4 stars only because I would have liked a longer couch and there was some weird dripping sound in the walls and the bathroom floor was oddly wet when we entered.Dear CourtneyRobyn,Thank you for your recent 4 star review.

The gift shop was accessible off the lobby.This location in Buckhead area offers easy access to the mall, restaurants, etc.My room was on the first floor - I could not get over how large the rooms were - an added perk. The housekeeping staff really takes pride in offering you a cleanguestroom. The breakfast offered in the lobby daily has alot to offer - you will not leave hungry. I also enjoyed the Wednesday night Manager's Reception - niceto see the ownership cares about the customer for a change.

"I stayed on the 3rd floor in an oceanfront room on the end, which gave me additional ocean views on the side. The only little thing that could have been different was the bed. It was rather thin and not really comfortable. It wasn't much of a problem, but definitely could have been better. If it wasn't for the bed, the stay would have been a perfect 10 - excellent! The staff was really helpful and friendly, the room was clean, the shower felt great, and I had everything that I needed was there. It's convenient to restaurants and shops, and right on the boardwalk. I felt very safe and secure in this area (boardwalk, hotel, and surrounding community).It was a great stay, and I would definitely consider staying here again and recommending to others!We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that our team took such great care of you! We do appreciate your feedback on the bed, if you could please let us know which room you stayed in we will get it fixed immediately. We look forward to welcoming you back again on your next trip to San Diego!",Good

"We stayed here during our visit to Universal due to being a Universal Partner Hotel (which was very convenient) We added a day on before arriving and had to make a separate reservation for pricing reasons, when we checked in we were told we had to change rooms after our 2nd night and check in again for the 3rd night, Carlos (Manager) fixed this problem and resolved this immediately without a issue or question. We are very grateful for this and made it nicer for us since we were traveling with a 3 year old. Our room was clean, quiet, and spacious. The pool was pleasant and the Hot Tub was well HOT!! The bathroom was large, but the floor was slippery when wet. My only complaint is that air conditioning seemed slightly off and the room seemed damp from it. Again I would like to mention how great Carlos the Manger was and Jennifer at the front desk for taking care of the check in issue.",Good

When I return to the San Diego area, I will be staying here.",Good
"We enjoyed our one week vacation with our family. The hotel staff and housekeeping (specifically the housekeeper for our room named Tochi) were all very sweet and kind). Also at the concierge desk Rita was very helpful and provided us with great information and was very sweet/understanding. The pools here were a bit overrated and crowded but overall we enjoyed the beautiful beach, snorkeling, and our nice rooms. Hope we can come visit some time soon!Aloha KitCat1818, Thank you for your 5 star review. We greatly appreciate it. I will be sure that Tochi and Rita is recognized for their amazing service.

"My wife and I have stayed at the Drury Inn New Orleans several times in the past and find the location, service, cleanliness and value to far exceed the competition. The staff and facilities are top notch. We booked two king suites for six guests pre-cruise and loved our rooms. However, until the valet area is complete, we may have to look elsewhere. We were trying to assist our elderly parents, our two children, and lots of luggage and feel the unloading area being used is very unsafe during peak times. There just isn't enough room to handle the volume of traffic. This was a very stressful situation before we even checked in. I am still rating our stay with 5 stars because the staff deserves it. Management needs to address the off street unloading problem!",Good
"I've grown to like this chain alot. Nicest breakfast around, included in the pricetag. As with alot of Orlando hotels, though, this one has way too many kids, and there was NO room for many folks to sit during the height of b'fast hours. The other concern I had was the lack of decent running nearby, but that's endemic to the area, not specific to the hotel. The room was fine, however, and no issues at all with any of the staff. I rank this one below the one in which I stayed the previous night near the Albany, NY airport. That one was superior, both in terms of the breakfast seating, breakfast selection, and the overall condition of the property (also fewer kids!) Running there was also better.",Good
"We stayed here two nights because we were going to disneyland for two days. I stay at Marriott's quite a bit for work so I had a couple of free nights from Marriott and this is one of the hotels we could stay in. I usually can count on Marriotts to be quite nice but.......I was surprised to see hair in the sink, on the ledge above the toilet and in the toilet. This just always grosses me out in any hotel that I stay in. I expect them to be clean. The bathroom also had drippy stains on the wall and where the tub meets the floor was pretty dirty too. The couch in the suite also had a huge stain on it. Needless to say I did not sit there.The beds are also very small in this hotel. They say they are queens but they seem more like fulls. I asked to be moved to a room with a bigger bed and they said all the beds are the same size. Very strange.......The staff was nice and the area that the hotel was in was decent too. It is right next to Angel stadium. It is not within walking distance of disneyland. There is a shuttle offered for 4.00 for an all day pass. But, just a warning it only comes every 60 minutes at the top of the hour. Not every 10 minutes like the lady at the counter told us. We loved that there was a starbucks in the adjacent parking lot.They offer a free continental breakfast. You order what you want the night before and they pack it up for you the next morning so you can take it back to your room. Its just the basics- yogurt, cereal, bread, juice etc......I have stayed in many of the hotels in the Disneyland area and many of them are used and abused due to the amount of traffic they see, but I do expect them to be cleaned properly. I probably will not stay here again.Thank you for your review of our hotel, we are pleased to hear that the staff was friendly and the hotels location provided some good accessibility. We do sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced in your room during your stay. We are excited to announce that there are plans for a renovation next year and comments from our valued guests continuously assist us in making improvements to our overall operation.

I was pleasantly surprised with how fast and easy it was to get to the park using the shuttle. It was never crowded and often we were t he only people riding. As far as the rooms go they were on par with other places I have stayed in the area. The breakfast vouchers for Denny's worked out great for my party of two. We were in and out in 30 minutes each day and the shuttle stop was right out front.

"We stayed here two nights while dropping our son at college. The first night, some sort of water leak wet the carpet near the bathroom. It was not a huge deal, but the executive housekeeper -- Crispin Harris -- bent over backwards to make things right, moving us to a new room, giving us free parking and leaving us a note of apology in our new room. Beyond that, the hotel is in a great location and has very nice rooms. My only complaints would be that the hot food on the breakfast bar was lukewarm, and it's a bit nauseating to try and find some fresh air in the patio area in front of the hotel and have to breathe second-hand smoke.

"My family decided to take advantage of the summer weekday sale prior to school starting back and overall it was worth it.None peak weekday checkin was simple. Peak checkin or late checkin might be a nightmare as there is only street curb parking for 4/5 vehicles. The valets and the hotel attendants were not helpful and ready to assist with bags. I noticed this for checkin and checkout.We had a great balcony room with a view of the river which was nice. The room was large with 2 queen beds. The bathroom was modern and up-date. Considering the building and room location, it was pretty quiet. One negative was the toilet stopped filling with water on our last day which made flushing a challenge. Overall, nice clean room and well worth the discounted price.A few tips:- depending on your location, like a lot of these older hotels, you might be lugging your bags up multiple flights of small stairs- elevators are small and not centrally located to most rooms- don't expect to get your car quickly if you're in a hurry- don't expect great porters Would I visit again Perhaps for the summer deal.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback, Matthew. We take pride in our historic hotel and do our best to place guests in rooms that surpass their expectations. We are sorry if that wasnt the case during your stay and for any inconvenience you may have encountered. Please know that your comments have been shared with our management team. We otherwise hope you enjoyed your New Orleans visit and hope for the opportunity to welcome you back to the French Quarter.",Neutral
"HI. everything was very nice. free wifi and free breakfast. the parking was not free though. the pool was warm and hot tub. there was not really any view but there was a good restaurant in the area named hunter steak house.Thank you for writing a review of our hotel. We glad to see that you've enjoyed the many amenities we have to offer including complimentary wifi, breakfast buffet, pool/spa/fire-pit. We hope that we'll be your first choice the next time you return to the San Diego area!",Good
the only thing about the hotel it was dusty plus the AC dripped water outside and my dad that is 75 years old fell because it was slippery which i didn't like that at all he got his knee scraped all.,Good
"My wife and I had a very pleasant stay at this nice boutique hotel in Union Square. The minute you walk in the lobby, you escape from the hustle bustle of Union Square. The lobby is very cozy. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately, the elevator was being renovated. But everything else was perfect! The wine reception at night, the comfortable bed, the free wireless in our guestroom, and the nice people that work there make it a great hotel to stay at. We shall return!",Good
"We enjoyed our stay at Columbus Motor Inn. The motel is fairly basic but good value, ideally located to visit Fishermans Wharf (5-10 mins). We had breakfast locally at Hollywood Cafe which was great. We used Muni route 30 regularly to get us about to places - convenient as there is a bus stop right outside the motel.We are a family of 5 and had requested a roll away bed and even with that in the room there was ample space in the room. We were not in the room much however as wanted to be out and about.Staff friendly and we did not have much need to call on them but they would have helped had we needed it",Neutral
"We stayed there because of the location near the High Museum of Arts and because we like to stay in Hulton Honors properties to get our points. The rooms are nice, well appointed, good bedding, great shower and nice bath products. The lady at the reception was super nice and helpful as was the waitress that helped me get a breakfast to bring back to the room. The lobby is very nice in a modern way. Everything was very clean.I have two complaints: The bar had nice wine and drinks but nothing bubbly, however the bartender was also super nice so I settled for Murphy Goode Sauvignon Blanc and I was happy. My second complaint is that the walls are a bit thin therefore you hear a little too much of what is going on in the halls and as I was falling asleep someone in adjoining bathroom dropped something and whatever it was, it made such a loud noise it jarred me awake as I was just falling asleep.All in all though, this is a good value for the price of the room.Thank you so much for your review. We always love to hear that our guests found our rooms to be well-kept and our staff friendly. I do apologize the bar was not able to accommodate your initial beverage request and will look into what we can do to add some more bubbly items! We also apologize for the noise you experienced during your stay. Thank you again for leaving your review and we hope to see you again soon.",Neutral

"This is my second review- the first one didn't pass the censorship of TripAdvisor. That's totally okay, I am feeling much nicer now. I am going to keep this short and simple.The location was great- 2 blocks from Jackson Square and so close to everything that I wanted to experience in the French Quarter. 5 stars from me on that one.The room itself was very large and for the most part comfortable. We had a windowless room, so it was very quiet- however disconcerting since we didn't have any idea of the time unless we checked a clock. The front desk staff was 50/50 for us- some of them were great, others acted like we were a big bother.Do not book this hotel if swimming in the pool is anywhere on your list of priorities. It really isn't any bigger than a hot tub.Now for the reason for my 2 star rating...Cleaning service came in on the second day and when we returned to our rooms were found hairs on our toothbrushes, and not the hair from my head.... on both of them.... so.....Anyway- my one attempt to speak to the front desk, I had one of the workers who seemed like she was bothered by everyone, and there was quite a line so I decided to just throw the do not disturb on the door and finish my last 2 days at the hotel without cleaning service. I had pre-paid for the room otherwise I would've made a bigger deal about it- but it just boiled down to what was worth my time and not being able to prove anything. And also trying to find a new hotel for the last 2 nights of my stay. I will not be returning to this hotel, and cannot give it a good recommendation on my experience.Typically housekeeping gets high marks for exceptional service - wasn't aware (during the visit) that there was a problem. Front desk is busy at times, but generally very responsive and cordial.",Bad
"The bed was very comfortable. Also nice to have a fridge and microwave. Most features of the room are upgraded except heating at cooling couldn's adjust to a comfortable temperature. Free parking however the garage is very small and there were not enough spots on the lot and garage to accomodate all guest. Bathtub was stained which was not a good look but other than that, the room was clean. The staff could have been alot more friendly and helpful.",Neutral
"The service was great. My room was clean and comfortable. I felt it was a safe area and was very convenient to the I5 freeway, easy to get on and off. I de-magnetized my room keys twice by storing my cell phone next to my key. The desk staff was very helpful and gave me new keys right away and, as I was traveling alone, made sure I got safely into my room. The breakfast was decent w/fresh fruit, yogurt, pasteries, cereals, condiments, waffle maker, boiled eggs and hot items. Juices and hot beverages were also available.",Good
"When travelling for business, the thing you care most about is getting some sleep, being able to effectively work and having a functional room that takes all the friction and noise out of your day.

"We spent three nights at the BW on St. Charles - a wonderful stay. The hotel is very conveniently located on St. Charles, about halfway between Tulane/Loyola and downtown New Orleans. The tram runs in front of the hotel, but we never heard a thing from our room. It is walking distance from Commander's Palace, where we had an unforgettable dinner one evening. You are right there to see all the beautiful homes of the Garden District and to visit Magazine street. The hotel itself is so accommodating. The breakfast is bountiful - hot and cold items, and lots of fresh fruit. They keep coffee, tea and fresh-fruit-flavored chilled water available all day. In the afternoon they put out warm, fresh-baked cookies. In the evening, there are grapes and cheese. All on the house! There is a decent-enough and very friendly Mexican-style restaurant and lounge attached. We ate there our first evening and cannot complain. What is nice, once again, is that the restaurant is a bit loud, but we never heard it from our room. Everything about this hotel is great. I would recommend it to any friend or family member, and would definitely stay here again.",Good
"The wife and I had a wonderful time at the St. James. Only minutes from the French Quarter, it provided us the opportunity to simply park the car and walk to all points of interest we wanted to visit in New Orleans.Every morning, you had the opportunity to had warm moist croissant, with preserves and butter. The butter was pre-warmed so one can spread it without completely destroying the croissant.Initially, the room they assigned us to was a bit warm. We assumed that the room would cool down as we were out in the French Quarter. Upon our return, this was in fact not the case. We contacted the front desk and they were apologetic and got us a new room within minutes.Great job to the staff at the St. James. They made our stay in the Big Easy great.Dear ClarksvilleCouple,We are delighted that we were able to make your stay in the Big Easy great! Specifically, you seem to have enjoyed our location and breakfast the most which are definitely two of our favorites. Regarding your comments about the temperature of your original room, we are happy that our front desk staff responded quickly to your call and were able to move you to a more comfortable room it is out passion to provide you with a restful night sleep.

"Ok spacious room. Bed ok not great. No amenities for SPG members let alone platinum members. I had to ask for my welcome gift. Restaurant awful. First warm drinks dusty bottles when having ordered a drink it certainly wasn't cold bottles. Then I was waiting for my breakfast ready to take a shuttle to the airport and the girl said no problem to have an omelet ordered and eaten by the time we had to leave for the shuttle. Well they kept coming back and saying it's almost ready and needless to say it wasn't. I wish she would have saved the trouble and told me to eat the buffet because I left without breakfast. Not an spg property. Won't waste my time staying here again. The Marriott across the way is much better. We always greatly appreciate the feedback of a frequent traveler such as yourself. It is correct that due to the size of our property we do not have an SPG Club Lounge, but offer all other SPG amenities in the Starwood program. You certainly should not have to ask for your welcome gift. We currently have several brand new team members at our front desk and although the SPG program is one of the first training items covered, your feedback allows us to identify need areas. I would also like to apologize for the delay in your breakfast order, which could only have been caused by unusual high volume at the time, which is however certainly not an excuse for not delivering the exceptional level of service that we are known for.

I don't know why TripAdvisor requires that you have 200 characters in your review unless they want to discourage people from posting reviews. I don't write reviews for a living and I don't even HAVE to write a review.

I apologize that our Wifi wasn't working properly.

"The other reviews here on Tripadvisor are very accurate, and helped us choose this hotel, hopefully I can add some additional comments of value. The hotel is super clean, modern and up to date. That it is actually an older building is completely invisible unless you look really hard. The front desk staff are all super nice and accomodating.Valet parking is the way to go. 2/day more than finding your own, the cars are kept right at the back door of the lobby, and a valet was always available. Worth every penny.The rooms are compact to be sure, but hey, you're in Hawaii, and you need to be outdoors! The rooms reminded me a lot of a typical cruise ship in square footage and furnishings, which is a compliment. Like a lot of european hotels, the A/C is controlled by your room key which you insert into the light switch next to the door. Took a moment to figure that out, but once we did, it was nice, helped keep us from losing our key, and I appreciated the energy-conserving feature. Yes, there is a truly crappy building that needs to be torn down/blown up or something next to it, but its hardly a dealbreaker. The rooftop pool is nifty, relatively private and appeared to be as well maintained as the rest of the place. The location is pretty darn awesome for not being on 'the strip'. Short walk to pretty much anything, bus stop on the corner, fun/weird/cheap breakfast place also at corner. There is a bar for anyone's taste or interest within a block or two. Lots of shopping from the lowest to highest end within a block or two. Very eclectic.The attached Mexican restaurant was quite good and reasonably priced.Cab drivers have no idea where this hotel is located. 3 tries, 3 cabs, and they all got lost. Either the recent name change or the one-way street the hotel is on threw them off. We found it more funny than annoying as cabs in Honolulu are plentiful, reasonably priced and driven just as horrifically as in any city.Aloha KurtS84!Thank you so much for the terrific comments and 5-star review! Your comments are very thoughtful and I appreciate you taking the time to post. Our intimate rooftop pool is one of my favorite amenities because you get such an amazing view in a very relaxed setting.

"The Hotel Allegro is an older hotel that has been renovated in the heart of the Chicago Loop. The location is ideal for theater goers and has easy access to public transport and cabs. The rooms are very well decorated and very clean, and the bed was wonderful. The Atelier Bloom amenities are nice, and the cheetah bathrobe is a fun touch. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is for the very small rooms and slow elevators, both likely as a result of it being a historic property. If you are traveling solo or are a close couple without a lot of luggage you should be ok, otherwise you should probably consider a roomier option.Hi there jpinedo!

"Having stayed at the sister property the Coventry Motor Inn back in 2014 and enjoying it, we chose this place when looking for affordable accommodations (with parking) in a slightly different area. This time around, we were spending 2 nights in SF at the end of a 3 week roadtrip decided to do one hotel more budget (this one) and then the final night being a bit more of a splurge at another hotel on the Embarcadero.The hotel is easy to find, and we got lucky with a parking space right near to the lobby to check in. The chap was nice and we'd booked a room on the top floor to try and make the best of the limited views this location has - we were a little early but he called through there and then to the housekeeper who was working on our room, and she said it'd be about half an hour, so we had a wander and had a beer and a game of pool in the bar across the street, and were able to check in on returning.The rooms were very similar to the Coventry Inn, in that they are older style, but clean, spacious and comfortable. One added bonus with the Columbus Inn was the small balcony we had in our room - enough to step out on and watch the world go by and with surprising good views of Coit Tower and even a glimpse of the Golden Gate across the rooftops, so I was a happy bunny!We were getting to the end of our stamina on this 4000 odd mile trip, and so opted to order take out to be delivered to the hotel for dinner. It was easy, and after signing up to Grubhub online (with the WiFi being included in the room price) and selecting a place, we called down to let reception know we had a delivery coming and he said they would bring it right up to the room for us - something we're not used to in UK hotels, but very convenient for 2 weary travellers!We were able to eat properly too, as the room has a small dining table and chairs next to the window. Winner! The bathroom is only small, but has a separate vanity/sink area so it was still functional. We slept great in the large comfy bed, and grabbed a yummy breakfast next morning at a cafe in the next street in walking distance, so that was another plus. All in all, i'd recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again. Nice work Columbus!!! :-)",Good

"The Four Points was a great hotel choice for my family of 4. We booked online through their website using a AAA discount and scored a two-bedroom suite with a mini kitchenette for about 240 a night. The suite was spacious, and having a coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator made our stay in Seattle feel like staying at home. The lobby and my suite were clean, modern and renovated. The beds are comfortable -- even the convertible sofabed in the living room. The hotel is located a little less than a half mile north of the Seattle Center where the Space Needle, EMP museum and Pacific Science Center. My family had a great time in that area. The location is in what I'd consider a developing area. It's not touristy it's near a few auto shops, a business plaza and a few blocks from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We felt perfectly safe walking in the evening and there are plenty of eating options, like a nice Pho Viet Anh and the corner QFC market which is open 24 hours.We took the monorail for 2.50 each way to get to Pike Place. That walk was a bit much for my 5 year old, so we took a taxi the next time and paid about 15-20, I believe. We stayed there for 3 days before the cruise, and I would be glad to stay there again. If you can afford it, you might want to stay closer to the Downtown area or Pike Place, but if you're looking for an affordable, spacious, comfortable and clean place, you might want to consider this place.",Good

This is a great hotel for everyone. It seems very secluded but is only a few miles from La Jolla and easy access to the freeway. You could drive by the property and never see it.There are alot of trees/flowers/etc for a homey feeling.The spa and pool area are lovely as are the grounds.Alot of the rooms have balconies or patio's. The Adobe restaurant does a great breakfast. Buffet or ala carte.Mustangs and Burros has a great feel with an outdoor fireplace and music nightly. Their specialty is margarita's. Scented candles are all over the property and lit at night for a romantic feel. The hotel has alot of meeting space and is only 3 stories high.suite 124 is really nice if you want a nice place to relax. It is very large. The 'regular' rooms are a nice size also. The staff is great and very accomodating.,Good

"if your wanting to spend alot of time at your hotal DONOT go here but if you want somewhere cheap, comforty + friendly to rest your head after long days at the parks id recommended it. Have to admit when first arrived i was gutted, but after a couple days realised this was just what we needed. theres a basic breakfast you can help yourself to in morning, free shuttles to all the big parks, i-trolley stop just outside on main road, heated swimming pool, internet + room was quite big apart from bathroom which was small + had a few cracks + dents here + there. Main road behind hotel which thought was going to be a issue coz fairly loud but after spending days in the parks, i can honestly say i had 14 very good night sleeps. would stay there again but as i say it is a budget hotel, just a bed to rest your bed if you are after more form your hotel don't go here.",Good
"This was a great hotel. Staff are helpful as long as you're not a complete snob (ie from Victoria, want to be pamperred like you're at a W hotel, etc). Rooms were clean, well decoraded, and the mini-fridge was great to have. Buffet was good even though it, um, was not, Atkins Friendly (I'm a nutritionist, don't get me started on that diet ) Housekeeping staff were friendly and attentive, and best of all, it's close to Qwest and Safeco Stadium. You'd be a fool to take a Cab from this hotel to the stadiums, simply jump on a Pierce Transit bus.

"Stayed here one night for business. I travel under government processes for projects, and unfortunately I forgot my government ID. I am never asked by Marriottt (as a gold) for my ID...but here I was asked, and because I forgot my ID, I ended up paying the last minute rack rate. I was not happy. Often i can get my office to email me something, but as would happen, the person who has a copy of my ID, was not in the office by the time I checked in..... so I am forced to pay out of my pocket the difference.... while the guy checking me in was trying to be nice about it, he insisted on the higher rate (after 30 years, this has NEVER happened, tho' I have been asked for my ID 2 times in 30 years as usually my profile is used). Since I am liable for my badge if I loose it, I don't travel with it. In addition the rate for parking is over 20 per nite (self parking where one has to walk in the snow/ice to park and retrieve their car)...... While I know that they are just enforcing a policy, I am a gold and have an established Marriot profile..... I will try to reduce the charge when I get back home, but I was really unhappy with this treatment.Hotel room was the smallest I have stayed outside many Manhattan hotels (however, even the Marriott Marquis in Times Square is 3 times bigger than this hotel). Attached is a copy of the bathroom photo that shows you have to step around the toilet to close the bathroom door.... unbelievably small. Room was marginally clean, as I found an empty water bottles in the room from the prior occupant, something sticky on the desk, and had to use my white noise machine for to sleep given the person next door who either had a guest or was on the phone talking rather loudly (tho' thin walls happens at many hotels).As you enter hotel, reception desk is on the left and there appears to be a large bar. You have to use a room key in the elevator to go to your floor and any permitted floor. The hallways are decorated with an attempt at stylish. Bed is very comfortable, which is why the three bubble rating.This hotel is about the same distance to the FAA offices on Devon, but next door to one of the airport contractor offices which is why I decided to re-try it...... I come to Chicago monthly, and this is the first time in a very long time I have stayed in this hotel. Normally I am at the Westin in River Road or the ORD Hyatt. Given the difficulty with the rate.... doubt I will be back here and have already booked the Westin for my next stay.Dear Mary V.: I am very sorry that you did not have the proper ID for the preferred room rate you booked and your stay with us did not meet your expectations. We already reviewed your suggestions with the entire team. Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay. Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl",Neutral

We got home after staying 2 nights at this QSOM hotel n they charged well over 400 (e.g. 3X rate) for 245 bill, but thank goodness AFTER making a couple calls to both QSOM hotel n my credit card company due to possible/potential FRAUD, fortunately, these charges were cleared AFTER 2 calendar days. Based on this huge mistake on hotel's part, we probably may NEVER stay here again. If it wasn't for this huge mistake, we would probably rate it much higher n possibly return, but possible/potential FRAUD is REAL n pretty concerning n scary. Hello Mrs. Lamp,On behalf of the staff Id like to apologize for this miscommunication, to further address the situation and clarify allow me to explainWhen a guest makes a non-prepaid reservation an authorization hold is taken the night before the check in date, if for one night the hold is usually the amount for the night plus 1 dollar, the authorization hold is used to guarantee you the room until 7am the following morning, the authorization hold then takes a few calendar days to drop. However if authorization is declined, after 4pm the reservation will be canceled if we have not heard from the guest.Again allow me to apologize for the inconvienence, we are in no way attempting to collect more than what the room cost is, and adhere strictly to hotel policies, including the Authorization hold, which has proven to be beneficial to our guest.My sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding, I do hope I was able to clarify and hopefully we will see you again at our hotel.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.

"We just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We loved it. Public transportation is right out the front door (bus and streetcar). If you'd rather walk, just head strait down Carondelet - it turns into Bourbon when you cross Canal (6 blocks).Hot breakfast is provided every morning in the lobby. On Sun-Thur, each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small, as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful, with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite, and it had tons of space, although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa, and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom, so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access, but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed, two night stands with lamps, entertainment center with television, telephone, and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa, chair, recliner, coffee table, entertainment center with television, refrigerator, and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided), and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet, as well as a coffee maker. Parking is 13 a day, which is a bargain. The lot is self-park, no valet, so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area, to use the elevators, and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans, and our first stay at the Drury.

The service there goes so far beyond expectations that you find yourself continually smiling with surprise (think: Peninsula hotels).

"Where can I start. We stayed here for 6 nights to have a grandson attend a course at Emory U. Good location not too far from the school, restaurants nearby and close to downtown Atlanta, but the place was a real dump!! The carpet was terribly stained. The kitchen old and outdated and we had to ask for pots/pans and after multiple requests they arrived the next day. There were only paper products, even though there was a dishwasher. After several requests, real dishes were supplied. Then when I went to use the dishwasher there was about 2 of brown water on the bottom. Ugh! No one every came up to fix this our entire stay. No cooking for us in this kitchen. Since we were here for an extended time I needed to use the laundry. Only 1 washing machine worked out of 2 and the dryers were old and rusty and the clothes were snagged on the cracked drum. Only used them out of desperation. There were 3 of us staying here and i had to ask for 3 sets of towels daily (only 2 were supplied) when we got home and were told towels were not available since they were washing towels at this time and would leave 3 sets the next day. One of us showered daily using a hand towel. Each day the situation repeated. When I was packing to leave a cockroach scampered across the floor. if I had seen this earlier in our stay we would have definitely left immediately. Do not stay here!!

"We were really looking forward to staying here. Unfortunately it was surprisingly disappointing. The room itself was very large and picturesque so we cant complain about this but the noise from outside made sleeping impossible some nights. The windows are obviously not double glazed so the noise from sirens was incredibly loud as they went up the street right outside the window. Also no television in the room. I think thats a must now. We dont watch a lot but the option would have been great. Mostly though accommodation is about the people and we felt like intruders in someones house. No good mornings or how was your day when we came in. We realise it was not a hotel so dont expect that level of service but a hello would be nice. Such a shame its in a great location. Sally,I am sorry to hear that you felt unwelcome here at The College Club. We do try to greet guests daily and are always available in person, or by telephone after office hours, to hear and address concerns. We appreciate you bringing your concern to light here and will work to do better in the future. It is true that the noise from outside can, at times, be unsettling. It is an unfortunate fact of being situated on a major thoroughfare in a populated area. Some guests are accustomed to it, some are not. Had we known of your trouble sleeping we would certainly have moved you to a room on an upper floor or away from the street. There is a television in the breakfast room which guests are welcome to use at any time day or evening. We do hope that, overall, your trip to Boston was enjoyable and would welcome the opportunity to have you as guests should you return.",Bad

"Only reason not to give the hotel a 5 star rating is the fact you have to pay to park and for internet. Rarely do I ever pay for these items at other hotels across the country. Parking is understandable, however paying for internet combined with a higher than average parking fee especially compared to hotels on the same block that charge nothing for either is a major turn off. Otherwise a fantastic hotel with great service. Still some renovation work happening as of today May 8 however it didn't cause any problems and was not intrusive. Overall another great stay.",Good

"Stayed there for a week. Friendly staff, clean rooms and bathrooms they clean twice a day.I could say it is located in the heart of SF. Right next to Chinatown Gate, few blocks from Union Square, and Market Street, and Embarcadero.Nice and quiet at night, for good sleep.We sincerely appreciate you recommending us and for sharing your experience. I am thrilled to read you enjoyed your one week visit. It sounds like you took advantage of the location and ventured out to see San Francisco.

"Spent 3 nights in the Garden Cottage with wife and two college age kids. Rooms was VERY nice and comfortable for the four of us. The common areas were extremely clean and the view from observation deck thingy was truly amazing. The staff was awesome in every possible way. We utilized one of the garages across the street and a word of warning they are small (had a full size rental and it just fit--don't plan on parking your full size SUV there and it is doubtful that a mid-size would fit). Breakfast was plentiful and the fruits, eggs... were very good, a disappointment though were the baked goods, although good they were not home made . Please understand they were very good, but when I stay in a BnB I don't expect store bought. Two other minor complaints, guests on their cell phones in the BF room and common areas, I was also working but i limited my cell phone usage to our rooms and outside lastly the dog. We are all dog lovers but not sure how appropriate it is to have the dog sitting on the chairs. Again overall a great experience and would most likely stay there again but need to call it as I see it.",Good
"Don't. do. it. This place is pretty crummy, really loud, all the walls are dark gray, the hallways are built for midgets, the floors slope, the furniture is too crudy even for Ikea - no chairs except these metal things that are not comfortable, the lights are about 20watts, the bathroom walls are those sheets of plastic made to look like tile....there is a Starbucks downstairs - yay - but does not make up for Uncle Fester, Lurch and Morticia who obviously were consulted on the decor and layout.

"OK, I am a budget traveler so I am not expecting a luxurious room. I cannot understand all the horrible reviews given to this place. I've stayed around the world in many small, dingy rooms, but I have never had a room that I couldn't stay in. After all, if you're in Orlando for a hotel room, maybe you should just stay home--you hardly spend any time in the room anyway. But for 28 a night, this was an incredible bargain. The room was very clean. The door keys take a special touch, but once you figure it out, it worked every time. The desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. The cleaning staff did a great job every day...and worked around all of my girls' stuffed animals. We stayed here 6 nights with my family of 4 and couldn't have asked for a better place at this rate. The location is great--lots of restaurants, close to I-4, close to Sea World. The pool is beautiful (the weather was just a little too cold for us to enjoy the pool). Maybe it's not the most exotic place and could use a few touch-ups...but for this price in Orlando it's wonderful. If you're expecting a fancy room, this is not the place for you, but if you like a great deal, I would highly recommend it.",Good
Good for a night's stop over at Barstow. We had a pretty good sleep after a long tiring day. The queen beds and pillows were very comfortable. Room was pretty much clean. Overall its a good property at a cheap price. Though they did not have free breakfast.,Good
"Yikes, the majority of the staff really give off a vibe that they don't care if you enjoy your stay. We are heading back to the area next month but are not returning to this hotel. It was noisy. We could hear the peoples conversations and the TV in the room next to us. We stayed for 6 days and 2 of those days we arrived home to our room and it hadn't been cleaned and restocked. All mornings we were woken up by the cleaning staff, vaccuming the hall ways. I have stayed in many hotels, at varying price points, and this one is definately not worth it. There are also a lot of extra charges that you don't expect. You also need a vehicle to stay there, and then have to use the valet service that was 25 a day, plus tipping the guys each time. It was an expensive stay, for not being relaxing. The website is misleading.The grounds were lovely, but that is really it. We loved San Diego so will just find somewhere else to stay. I should also mention that our credit card was compromised while we stayed there so when we got home, our credit card company's called to let us know, cancelled our cards and sent new ones, we then had to contact all the our preauths and that was a bit of a mess. We just received a letter today from Destination hotels and resorts (Estancia is one of their resorts) apologizing for the violation. Sigh!",Bad

"I have to be honest that from the outside, the hotel seemed a little scary and outdated. Once inside, however, it was one of the most modern Marriott locations I've stayed in. The lobby area was welcoming and there were plenty of areas to hang out with colleagues in the evening. And the rooms were equally modern and larger than average. My only complaint was that the bathroom was extremely small. I highly recommend this location for small business conferences given its proximity to the airport. The shuttle came in very handy for conference attendees.Dear BFR1920, thank you for taking the time to write your experience while staying with us.

"Seven of us flew into Seattle relatively late in the day and stayed overnight at the Four Points. The next AM we were able to use a meeting room to prepare for our business meeting in Seattle (walking distance from the hotel, in fact). While the hotel does not have a lot of frills but the kitchen was open until 10:00 and the bar until midnight and the staff was both accommodating and friendly. The hotel had a functional exercise room that is open 24 hrs (six pieces of standard equipment and a set of weights) which is adequate for the number rooms. Although ostensibly a tobacco free facility I was fairly certain that one of the previous guests smoked extensively in my room which detracted from my visit as did the noise from the ice machine directly opposite my room. The room in fact was a roomy king with a good desk with multiple power outlets. WiFi was complimentary. All in all the price was right compared to other higher end places in the neighborhood.Thank you for sharing your review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your experience while staying with us and are glad we were able to assist you in preparing for your business meeting. We take great pride in providing our guests with a smoke-free environment and apologize for any lingering traces of smoke.

"Nice, clean hotel with good amenities. Breakfast room too small for the number of people staying (many took food to their rooms). Only other disappointment was that our room had only a shower, not a full bath. We are sorry you were disappointed with some aspects of your stay. We strive to make every guest happy and comfortable. We have had a very very busy Spring season and the hotel has been at capacity many days. Unfortunately that has meant that our breakfast area has been a bit crowded some mornings when everyone shows up at the same time. We do provide outdoor seating to alleviate some of the space issues. Our breakfast is pretty extensive with eggs, meat, pancakes, cereals, fruits, breads, etc - so guests may also linger a bit longer than at other less complete breakfasts. Our regular rooms do feature a glass shower with a separate granite vanity area. This design was created due to guest reviews and requests. It seems that most guests prefer a shower and the tub was wasted space. We do have a few handicap access rooms that have tubs, so if you return to the area, please inquire about them. There bathroom set up may work better for you. We hope you will come see us again!",Neutral
"I grabbed this good deal on Hotwire for about 80 per night. Of course, being right in the city, we had to pay for valet parking through the hotel for 20 per night. But this still was cheaper than most hotels in the area. This hotel was by far the fanciest accommodations we stayed in on our trip to Washington State, and a great way to end our vacation.Since we left the car with the valets (and didnt want to pay for parking around the city), we simply walked everywhere around town. Pike Place Market is just four blocks from the hotel, and the waterfront is just a few blocks past that. We walked over to the Seattle Center (10 blocks), but have to admit that we rode the monorail back. It stops right in the mall that connects to the back of the hotel--very convenient!! We also walked to Pioneer Square (13 blocks) and even walked to the REI flagship store (13 blocks).We stayed on the 8th floor, looking towards 5th Street. Our room with a king-sized bed was super comfy and everything was extremely clean.",Good

The free wifi was faultless in all areas of the hotel. The breakfast and 5:30 kickback were very good, with plenty of choice for even the fussiest eater like me! The hotel itself has been well maintained and appeared spotless. Excellent value for money. Will most definitely stay again.I would also like to thank the hotel staff who found and kept safe my friends credit card which was left behind in our room after check out.",Good

"We stayed here for three nights on a friends trip to explore Seattle. The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk to rent kayaks on Lake Union and to great restaurants and bars up the street. An Uber ride to Capitol Hill was quick and cheap. We had a one bedroom suite and since there was three of us, one slept on the pull out couch. The inconvenient thing about the room was the bathroom being located IN the bedroom which was awkward to use at night when people are sleeping in the bed. Also, there was no garbage in the bathroom area which was annoying for two ladies getting ready to go out. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The front desk was very helpful when we needed to store our luggage before check-in because of early arrival. I ate a salad from their restaurant one night and it was only okay, however, the breakfast was very good with lots of hot options and a waffle bar. Overall for the value, I would definitely stay again.Thank you for staying with us and leaving such a wonderful review. Cheers!",Good

"This hotel is in a fantastic location, 2 streets from bourbon, so I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go. When going up to my room I was put in the back facing the below parking and not over the garden that all the pictures show so I was a little disappointed right from the start. When walking into the room it was terribly small. The mirror and sink are not even it the bathroom and the actual bathroom just closes with a sliding closet door. The shower itself was nice. Walk in and glass doors. The beds were rock hard and the pillows were just small throw pillows. Other than the location the other part I liked was the garden and swim area. I did not swim as the pool was full of leaves and such. I had seen an employee put a self cleaner in the pool but it still didnt seem as clean as I would have thought it to be. The staff always said hello when walking past but they didnt seem very happy. Overall I dont think I would stay here again.Ms BrittanyThank you for accenting our unique location, we are glad you found getting around the French Quarter convenient.I hope you change your mind about returning to our hotel, please keep my email and phone number below so I can do everything possible to assist in reserving the area of the hotel which makes you most comfortable.

"We were in Miami to visit family and had stumbled across this motel via the web and felt between the unique look and great location, it was worth a gamble. We were not disappointed. In fact, if it was not for one item, we would have rated the motel excellent.I told my wife that this motel was like an oasis amidst the neighborhood commercial buildings. The amount of landscaping around the pool area and rooms provided a sense of privacy and relaxation. It has an old fashioned look from the outside, which is repeated within the rooms themselves. The rooms were plenty large, the bed was very comfortable, the air-conditioning kept us comfortable, even though we faced the hotter western sun. And the sound-proofing was such that we could barely notice the music being played at night at the pool bar. The shower is quite large, but is also the source of my complaint. During showers, water would go from comfortable to very hot to very cold, even though we had not touched the settings. If you waited a few seconds, the temperature would go back to normal, but it was a true annoyance. I agree the continental breakfast was slim, but was very pleased to see that it was constantly restocked very often. And the best part was the coffee. My wife is so tired of watered down hotel coffee. She really enjoyed the morning brew and that is saying something.Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. As noted, the restaurant is currently closed for renovation, which was a disappointment as our family had told us how enjoyable it is. Also, please note that parking is in a horseshoe shape on the outside edge of the building. We had no concerns about the neighborhood, but would certainly advise against having anything of value visible in the car. Would we stay here again Absolutely yes, but we would hope that the shower issue has been resolved in the future.Thank you so very much for your feedback and so glad you truly enjoyed your stay. Hopefully you will be returning sooner rather than later. We do service our heaters on an annual basis even though they are relatively new and in fact they were serviced less than a month ago which is why I am quite irritated that you experienced temperature fluctuations in your room. Another service call has been made and the issue will be dealt with promptly.By the way, we always advise guests not to leave valuable items in their cars anywhere in Miami.",Good

"We had a decent stay here. I booked this hotel for the price and proximity to Disneyland. We were able to either drive, walk or take a shuttle to Disneyland with ease and the price was only about 100-110 a night. For the price, it was a good value. But an older hotel. While the rooms have been refurbished and are clean with nice linens, the A/C was an old swamp cooler in the wall and was very loud. And the only way to keep the room cool in 100 degree heat all weekend, was to run it 24 hours a day. Not great for sleeping. Also, there were small bugs that kept showing up in the bathroom, probably one or two a day. Not sure what they were, just kinda gross. The staff was friendly and efficient.

"I rarely write reviews but after reading some of the scathing reviews, and wanting to cancel my own reservation after reading them (but had booked a nonrefundable reservation), I wanted to make sure this sweet little hotel receives the credit it deserves. I just stayed one night, prior to a residency interview in SF, so to be fair, was only in the hotel to sleep.First of all, the front desk is incredibly accommodating and efficient. Check in was a breeze. I requested the quietest room, and the nice man at the front desk gave me a room on the top floor away from the supposedly noisy elevator. The lobby is perfectly nice, did not smell, and I was very comfortable sitting there waiting for my ubers. The room was clean, quiet and the bed was comfortable (and I am actually quite picky about springy mattresses). There are some homeless people across the street, but I was never bothered or approached by any of them. Honestly, if it upsets you to see homeless people, SF is probably not the city you want to visit. The only negative was that the hallway did have a mild odor, but my room was fine. Overall, you stay at this hotel to spend less than 100 on a room in a very expensive city. It is not a luxurious experience, but it is a perfectly comfortable place to spend a night and I would recommend it.Thank you so much Lauren for making an exception for us, and taking the time to write such a comprehensive review of your stay with us. We're delighted that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you found us to be a reasonable, yet clean and comfortable hotel for your short stay.

"Wanted to stay in a hotel close to the airport, so picked the Hilton Garden Inn. The staff is very professional and friendly. This hotel is kept clean, which is always something I look for when traveling. My bed was very comfortable. Having a good TV with multiple channels was a bonus. The business center is a little small (2 computers), but the equipment is up to date and in good condition. The breakfast is a buffet, which is pricey (12 something). They do offer a continental breakfast, but it is limited. Without a car, restaurant choices outside the Hilton Garden are somewhat limited. The hotel restaurant was pretty good, but they don't have capacity to handle large groups. A party of eleven people showed up before us, so we were told it would take 45 minutes before we could get served. We ate at another restaurant that night. In summary, nice staff and a clean room, but food choices kind of limited without a car.Dear guest M H:Your effort and time in sharing your comments surrounding your experiences during your last stay is most appreciated and something we take very seriously.

"This hotel was delightfully close to the graduation ceremonies for UCSD (we walked!) Our room was on the small side and totally enclosed (no patio). We were in the last building close to the pool and spa. Sadly, the walk to our room entailed walking through long corridors of indoors rooms through two buildings. There was a beautiful courtyard area in each building but it was not designed so that you could walk outside in the lush gardens :(The valet staff was the most helpful. Giving us water and directions when we needed them. The staff at the front desk were cool and impersonal.The pool was very pretty and our son enjoyed swimming in the salt water.

"SPG Platinum and Hyatt Diamond who normally favors MCO's Hyatt airport properties. Decided to check out the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport on an overnight transit stay.

Although the overall satisfaction rate of our SPG members is generally very high, there is certainly no excuse for such a severe oversight as dirty linens, and I can assure you that this has been addressed with the housekeeping team.

"My wife and I stayed here for one night prior to our cruise the following day. I searched the internet for perhaps 2 hours before I found this gem and made a reservation months in advance. We were picked up at the airport by the complimentary shuttle. The wait time was about 40 minutes. The front desk clerk was very pleasant and very accomodating. The check in went smoothly and I was even able to make port transfers at the same time (12 pp).Our room had 2 double beds with adjustable mattresses. The room was very clean and included several pillows for each bed. This hotel has its own restaurant but no complimentary breakfast. However, there is a Dennys and a McDonalds across the street as well as a gas station with a small store where you can get snacks and pop for the cruise ship. There is also a data center with free wifi, an exercise room and a pool w/ hot tub. This hotel also has a plan for storing your car for free while you are on a cruise if you stay only one night. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone looking for a stay prior to a cruise.",Good
"This hotel was very clean and the breakfast had some hot items that are always appreciated. Our room had a scorch mark from an iron on the carpet, but otherwise was very clean.

"The OPI is not a luxury hotel, but it is one of my all-time favorites. We have stayed twice in the past two years, and can't say enough good things about it. The location is absolutely perfect- right on the beach and walking distance to almost anywhere in Pacific or Mission Beach. Both times we have booked partial ocean view rooms, which look out on the pool and actually seem to be full ocean views. The rooms themselves are clean and relatively modern, with fridges and small balconies (and amazing views). The free breakfast is not exactly gourmet, but is generous and includes fruit, yogurt, cereal, and a waffle bar. We found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. The hairdryer in our room stopped working as I was getting ready for a wedding- I panicked, but the maintenance man came within 10 minutes to replace it, which I very much appreciated. Overall, I can't recommend this place enough if you are looking for a reasonably priced and centrally located beach hotel. I've stayed in a few other hotels in the area, but none come close to the OPI.Fantastic review Olivia! We are thrilled to hear you once again enjoyed your stay with us, and were honored to be your go-to property for your visits to PB.

"My girlfriend and I stayed at your hotel this past weekend, Saturday November 19th. I have stayed in many different hotels in San Diego (I live in Orange County so we travel there a lot to get away) and I must say I was very impressed and happy with the level of service that we received. We went down to San Diego to celebrate my girl's birthday and am very glad we chose your hotel. I purchased my reservation through Expedia so I was a little unsure of what to expect especially given the price for the room we stayed in. Your hotel surpassed my expectations. I will definitely be coming back to your hotel (probably for New Year's) given it's location and because we were treated so well. Joe at the front was very helpful and helped me out when I was trying to schedule a message from the in room services..please thank him. The only small complaint I have was that the room wasn't ready when we got there (wasn't ready till about 4) but I was allowed to check out a little late so that more than made up for it.

"I'll start off by letting you all know that when travelling in the UK we usually stay in cheap hotels (Travelodge, Premier Inn etc) but this hotel is the pits.

Centrally located for all attractions- Good neighborhood- Exceptional staff- always available and willing to go the extra mile- Clean well appointed rooms and bathrooms- Newly renovated- A/C in roomsWe would stay here again in a heartbeat.

"I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews but I found the Monarch to be very comfortable. The rooms were clean and the linens were fresh. Our room was always cleaned by the maid service prior to 11am. The staff also was very helpful in getting cabs, shuttles, and directions. Also I wanted to let people know that this is a big city neighborhood. There are homeless people in the neighborhood asking for change, but you find the same people at the wharf and union square. So if you have a budget or even if you dont I recommend the Monarch. You can walk to Union Square in 10 minutes, spend 7 bucks on a cab to the wharf, or walk around the corner to Van Ness and shop for a new Land Rover or Mercedes.",Neutral

"Our room had no heat, no hot water, and staples coming out of the carpet in one spot. We were moved to a new room which still had no hot water and had the bonus of a broken phone. The staff issued keys to other guests for that room, and three older ladies were shocked to open the door and find a baby sleeping in their room. We reported all of our issues, of course, and the staff did their best to compensate us for the inconveniences. They eventually helped us find a different hotel, negotiated a discount rate, and paid for our cab to get to the new location. We appreciated the exemplary staff, but we were bothered when we realized the hot water issue had been going on for several days and they were STILL not disclosing the situation to customers as they checked in. That was disturbing. The silver linings of this stay...... clean space, good breakfast, gorgeous lobby, and a staff that was accommodating and helpful (but perhaps not completely honest).",Neutral

"I had a quick weekend in Phoenix due to a family emergency and this hotel couldn't have been a more perfect reprieve from the chaos of the circumstances that led to the trip. The hotel staff was excellent, extremely friendly and social with guests. The lobby and decor was really cool with art everywhere. Bar was lovely with fun, inventive drinks and a lively, but not obnoxious atmosphere. Room was very spacious with great amenities, though some options in the mini bar would be nice. Bed was great as was the shower. I had a balcony that looked over the pool area. Great little couch to sit on outside. I have stayed in a couple of Ace hotels and I would say this hotel has that feel, but done much better. For the reasonable price this hotel is wonderful! Thanks Found:re for bringing some light to a crap weekend : ).Wow! Thank you so much for the wonderful review. We're so happy to hear you had a great stay. We can't wait to have you back.

"My husband, 18 year old son and I made our first visit to Chicago and stayed here on the 19th floor of the Comfort Suites on Michigan Avenue. It was a great choice! The elevators were fast (good for a claustraphobic like me!), our suite was roomy and had all the conveniences we needed, and the view of the river, the street below and the amazing architecture around us was outstanding! Other than taking the Metra one day to the Museum of Science and Industry, we walked everywhere. There were more restaurants, shopping and theatres close by than we could ever visit in one trip. I felt totally safe at all times, and having a 7 Eleven just a few doors down was so convenient. I definitely recommend this hotel for families because of the washer and dryer, full kitchen and space. We had a large walk-in closet along with two smaller closets, and the living space was very spacious, even with two beds. Being in the middle of the shopping district and the park was great! All of the staff that we encountered were courteous, friendly and helpful. The parking was not a big deal (that actually was my biggest worry). We simply turned the car over to the attendant at the Hard Rock Hotel. We carried our bags ourselves to and from the hotel (a half block walk). The cost of parking is high, but it is everywhere in downtown. It did look like the self-parking lot was only a block further from the hotel, and we probably would use that next time, since we carried our own luggage anyway. (It's a lot cheaper) We did not move our car the whole time we were there, since everything was either within walking distance or the train.Dear smokemom,Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review. Your review was so great detailed. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay and our location. Thank you for all of the great comments.Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",Good
"We stayed her as part of our Honeymoon trip recommended by the local Tourist Board. We were very disappointed on arrival the hotel was built in the early 1900, however they have not spent much money on the property, Carpets were grim and dull and walls and paintwork was cracked , mould and paint peeling off. Bathroom was tiny, while sitting on the loo you were able to rest your head on the wall in front of you. Shower just about dribbled out so you barely got wet. They were working in two rooms with lots of concrete and dust, we were not told this at the time of making our reservation, which was on the day of arrival. The hotel also had an evening event taking place in the ballroom and our room was overlooking part of the courtyard where everyone spilled out to during breaks and when it finished the noise was so bad it was as if we were lying in the middle of a nightclub. We were kept awake after driving over 300 miles and on honeymoon. Breakfast was very limited/basic in fact with very low cost items and plastic plates/cups ect. Not what I would expect having paid over 100Thank you for your review. We try to notify all guests of events in our ballroom and I am sorry that we failed to do so when you checked in. I sincerely regret the disturbance to you and your wife. In the future, if you have any trouble in your room or otherwise, please alert the front desk and we will be happy to move you to a more suitable room. Your feedback is very important to us and appreciated as it helps us to make improvements. Best, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn",Bad
"I had booked this room through Travelocity so it was paid in full. We decided to book here because I wanted to treat my family to TWO king beds and had booked this type of room. We arrived at 5:00 pm after traveling all day and was told our room was not ready even though check in was at 3:00. Told the manager that was unacceptable and he offered a one king/one sofa room. Told him this was unacceptable. He then offered a two queen room. After some haggling I asked for a discount and he offered 30 or 40 and would email Travelocity to adjust my price. Later I ran into him and he asked if I needed anything and I said an email from Travelocity with my refund which he said I would get in 10 minutes. By morning still no email so I called Travelocity directly who was WONDERFUL and called the manager while I was on hold and got the refund processed. Had I not called I am certain there would not have been a refund issued. As for this place: Run as fast as you can. There are people here that must rent by the month and are quite shady. Lots of garbage built up outside rooms, the parking lot has thousands of cigarette butts, lots of partying and ruckus during the night. Our bathroom had dirty footprints and there was literally a hole in the wall where the cable line is and we could see straight through to our neighbors room. The grounds are a mess. Breakfast was a complete joke. Make your own eggs in an electric fry pan. But there were no eggs, only 4 pieces of toast and a few mini muffins left that I put on a plate for my still sleeping family and got yelled at by the scary looking front desk worker when I arrived at 8:00. Yes, there was a sign that says no food out of the breakfast area but at that point I did not care about following the rules. A nice lady eating breakfast after me dug through the cabinets and found an extra container of muffins and a box of frosted flakes but according to other people eating they forgot to go shopping and that is why they were short on food. The dispenser for the juice was not filled---instead you poured your own from the jugs they had from the store that who knows how long were sitting out.",Bad
"Our king suite was spacious and well decorated, much better than many Residence Inns in which we have stayed. Location is great with the South Union Streetcar, Museum of History and Industry, the Lake Union shore, and several good restaurants within a short walk. Breakfast is excellent with lots of variety. The atrium is gorgeous and is a great place to have breakfast. As for a room with a view of Lake Union since the back side rooms look out to a parking lot and an ugly highway.",Good

"We stayed at the Residence Inn Seattle Lake Union July 5 to July 8, 2010. RESORT CHECK IN: We arrived at about 11:00 AM. Check in is at 4:00 PM. They had a room available and check in was quick. We had a rental car and parking was in the lower level for 23.00 per day.ROOM: Our room was on the 7th floor 7023. There was a kitchen with stove, refrigerator with ice maker, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, dishwasher and stocked with all the utensils. The bedroom was separate with a king bed, bath with tub and shower. Two nice flat screen TV's with cable in the living room and bedroom. The couch in the living room converted to a bed. The patio had the view of a side street and had no chairs. There were lake view rooms at additional cost. I called the front desk and asked for chairs and they were brought up promptly. The room had WIFI internet and worked great. The AC worked great. Everything in the room was very clean. Housekeeping was excellent.BREAKFAST BUFFET: Included with your room was an awesome hot breakfast buffet from 6:00 am to 9:00 am in the main lobby. They served scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, fruits, waffles, breads, doughnuts, juices, cereal. There were 3 newspapers first come first served.LOCATION: This hotel is in a great location. There were many restaurants within walking distance. Across the street there is a marina and a sea plane company where you could take a ride to see the area or take one of their scheduled flights to Canada. Mass transit to downtown Seattle is right in front of the hotel.FITNESS CENTER AND POOL: There is a small Fitness Center which had treadmills, elliptical, bike, weight machines, and dumbbells. You will find a small pool next to the Fitness Center with Men's and Women's locker rooms. Both are located on the 3rd floor.HOTEL: All employees were very friendly and helpful. The hotel lobby is an atrium with a waterfall. Everything was very clean inside and out. The front desk has a computer you can access your airlines website and print out your boarding passes.THINGS TO DO: Visit the Pike Street Market in downtown Seattle. Go to a Seattle Mariners game at Safeco Field. WEATHER: The weather was absolutely fabulous. Three days without a cloud in the sky. Record breaking temperatures in the 90's. SUMMARY: The Residence Inn Seattle Lake Union is an excellent hotel. We will certainly stay here when we return to Seattle. Email me at blueeyes1952yahoo.com if you have any questions.",Good
"The hotel has a great lobby, but when we stayed recently there were a lot of events going on, with tons of people in the lobby and walking around our floor. It was quite noisy until late at night and difficult to get on an elevator. That aside, the location is good, the rooms are large, and the service was fine. We did have a problem with the heat/AC, however. It either blasted heat or turned the room into an ice box, nothing in between. Overall, a decent hotel but we won't be rushing back.",Neutral

"As a business traveler you get accustom to average. So on the rare occasions that you come across excellence I just get giddy. Best Western Miramar is just that AWESOME. Its like being at home. The hotel (Holiday Inn) across the street bills at 229.00 a night on average and is a drop in the bucket compared to this establishment. Best Wester is nice, clean and a bargain. You have a small studio like room with a sofa and refrigerator/microwave in every room. The people make the place Jimmy at the front counter and Mr. Patel make my day every time I check in. I have stayed in 100's of hotels and this one is one of my favorites. For the service, for the amenities but mostly for the people. Dear Valued Guest Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar. We are thrilled to hear that we were able to provide you excellent service and you found our hotel to be the best value. We are also very pleased to hear that it is awesome and were able to make you feel like you were at home. We strive to work hard in providing great quality service, and we are glad to hear that Jimmy, Mr. Patel, and the rest of our staff are no exception.

It's undergoing a renovation. The staff is exceptionally courteous, helpful and professional. I received a letter from Mr. Robert Morrison (Area Director of Rooms) and the assistance of Mr. Steve Vissotzky (Managing Director) and Ms. Sarah Sawatzky (Executive Assistant). I was impressed. I can afford to stay where I wish and it's changes such as this and the staff that make me want to continue to come back.",Good

"I stayed for four nights. The staff is great. The room is not up to date furnishings but very functional and everything is clean and solid. The bathroom was spotless. I had a suite with so much space, a couch, desk, fridge, coffeemaker, comfortable chair, good internet and large tv with good cable package. The breakfast is basic (pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausages, plus assorted breads, cereals, juices, coffees and so on) but the ingredients are all fresh and taste good. Their restaurant is very nice, the staff just incredibly friendly with actual good service. Plus the dinners were good deals for the price. There is a smaller room of a fitness center, but there is a treadmill, cross-trainer etc. and equipment feels new and the room is well designed with all the details. Didn't use the pool and jacuzzi this trip. The hotel is located in a quiet section of downtown, which is great concerning noise, but means walking a good 15 min to get to either Gaslamp area or any direction really. A car makes sense in this area. The train station is nearby as well, but the hotel was nice enough to offer a free ride to it on our check-out day. The only issue ahead is a corner now just finished digging for a new condo building. Once that gets up in floors it may be noisy for a while. But now now.",Good

We have stayed here over the past three years and found it a nice alternative to the big hotels. It seems that the property maintenance is not kept up. External building cleanliness has deteriorated along with the quarters decline in upkeep. Rooms are clean but small and cramped if you have a lot of luggage. The hotel location remains very important and is very convenient to most restaurants and bars. Bums hanging out on the sidewalk and on corner of hotel are bothersome. You don't really want to deal with a foul mouth drunk or whatever on your way into your room. We appreciate your feedback and apologize that you were disappointed with some aspects of your stay. We take pride in our historic hotel and are always working to improve. Please know that your comments will be shared with our management team. We thank you for your loyal patronage over the last three years and we look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back to the Quarter.,Good

"I stayed at this hotel while in town for a conference. The main conference hotel was fully booked so I used Trip Advisor to look for an alternative, and found the Horton Grand. I wanted something interesting and authentic rather than international-hotel-chain-plastic, and the Horton Grand really delivered. Yes, it's shabby in places and some of the wooden furniture and fitments are chipped and knocked about, but that really didn't matter. Staying here was lovely. With the benefit of reviews from previous guests on TA I asked for and was given a room at the back of the hotel. People coming out of the nightclub opposite still got a bit noisy on a couple of nights (I was there over the Memorial Day weekend) but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't disturb me over-much. There was worse noise from the room upstairs: the floors (although carpeted) are wooden, and there must have been a family of elephants staying up there! It still wasn't enough to put me off though. If you want a quiet hotel, don't stay in the middle of the entertainment quarter!Service was good, my room was clean, and breakfasts were fine.If you want an experience that's a little different from the McDonald's type of hotel, this one is for you :-)",Good
"I travel to San Francisco often being that I live in Los Angeles and my sister lives up there, It is less than a days worth of driving or an hour flight so the city is not difficult for me to get to. I travel up there about once a month and almost every time if I am not staying at my sister's, I will stay at Hotel Diva. Truly for the money you pay at this hotel and the location it is in, considering all the other mega hotels around it, it is totally worth it! I give this hotel 4 stars because truly it is not a 5 star hotel. It is very small but very modern and updated. It is in the middle of union square just walking distance to bars, restaurants, all the shopping you could want and of course Ruby Skye and the Starlight room if you're into those popular attractions. The decor is very modern and hip with lots of black and white everywhere, which I love. Beds are comfortable, space is small but it is more of a boutique style hotel. The people at the front desk are always willing to go above and beyond for their guests and always want to make sure everyone is satisfied. I also love the way the windows actually open in this hotel, so many hotels in the city don't allow you to fully open windows or to open them at all, some are sliding doors with a screen or a small knob that you can crank to crack it open, but I love the single pane that slides up to open and let you get the fresh air! have now stayed there multiple times and I still plan to go back again :)Hi Suzi F,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager",Good

The staff was friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and the King room was a nice size. Rooms had a microwave and fridge. An average breakfast is included in the stay which was nice. My only complaint is that the hotel is very close to the interstate so we heard some traffic at night. Get a room away from the highway if possible. I give it a high three rating.Serena, Hopefully you enjoyed your four day stay at our location over the Holiday Season. We hope you have a opportunity to come stay with us again in the near future.

My hearing isn't what it used to be, but my eyesight is 20/20. They are understaffed and a few of the desk crew would rather be somewhere else. WiFI is really weak as well.

"The Bienville House has the perfect location for a visit to New Orleans, close to the action in the French Quarter, but not too close. Added to that is its incredibly friendly and helpful staff, including everyone from the person who helps you with parking your car, to the ladies at the front desk, to the maid who cleans your room. The balcony rooms are especially nice and look out onto a patio with saltwater pool and a view of the river in the distance. Overall decor is about what one would expect for a hotel that refers to itself as boutique. However, now to the but. The beds in the balcony rooms (where we stayed) are double, and soft to the point of sinking when one climbs in. They are most uncomfortable and should be replaced with queen-sized beds to match the wall-mounted headboards. The room coffee maker is about as minimal as can be found in any hotel, and the coffee and condiments provided are truly weak for a city that prides itself on its fine coffee. The daily ration of two packets of Twining tea was a nice touch! On leaving the elevator area, the halls to the rooms are stark, grey and unadorned. The word drab comes to mind. The biggest shortcoming we found at the hotel was the continental breakfast. Cold, stale bread, bagels and muffins do not constitute a continental breakfast, even with the added, but limited, selection of yogurt and cereal. We are certain that some of the same slices of bread appeared in the bread baskets on each of the four days we stayed, but hopefully we are mistaken. The person taking care of the buffet was very friendly and worked hard to take care of guests at breakfast. Unfortunately, she apparently didn't realize that the gloves she wore the entire time she was working were meant to be changed when performing different tasks. The same gloves stayed on no matter whether handling coffee cups, putting out food, clearing tables, or picking up items off the floor. An explanation regarding proper sanitary technique is in order. So, as said in the title, this could be a great little hotel, but it just needs some work.................Thank you for taking the time to comment regarding your recent visit to New Orleans and Bienville House. I regret that you did not receive the level of service we are capable of providing and I apologize.

"I was looking for a smaller, boutique hotel to stay at prior to our cruise and for my husband and I to spend some time with my sister and her husband from Texas. This was an extension of my 50th birthday celebration. After many days of debating on which hotel to stay in while in New Orleans, I chose, the St. James Hotel. I am so glad I did. We stayed August 6th thru August 9th. From the time we got there, on Thursday morning. They were so helpful. Storing our luggage and telling us how to get around in New Orleans. Michelle was a Huge resource. She suggested places to eat (Mulates, Pralines, Ruby Slipper, etc.) which all had delicious food. She was also very helpful with explaning how to get to places and hooking us up with the bus tours. It ment a lot to me that she and the rest of the staff were so friendly and helpful. The hotel was decorated beautifully, the guest rooms were very accommodating and the beds were very comfortable. The location for excellent for us. It was within walking distance to the French Quarter, the World War II museum, Harrahs, the Aquarium, the mall, and the cruise terminal. This was definitely a hotel to remember and when I make it back to New Orleans we know where we will be staying.Dear Suyling,Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent experience at the St. James.

"This Hampton Inn was one of the nicest low-cost hotels I've ever stayed in. I got a tremendous price through hotels.com. Comparable rooms at other hotels usually cost almost twice as much. The room appeared to have been recently modernized, with updated furnishings, appliances, wide arc shower curtain, etc. The mattress was in great shape too. The room was very clean. The surrounding neighborhood includes a small park, and many good restaurants in walking distance (although its a very busy road). The included breakfast was great ... with several hot choices, such as waffles bagels topped with eggs, cheese and bacon and home fries. There was also a good assortment of yogurts, fruits, cereals, pastries etc... plus hard boiled eggs. The breakfast room was well-staffed and well-supplied.If you need a place to stay on the north edge of the city, I highly recommend this hotel.

"Booked one night for Sunday Memorial Day weekend, we found the lowest rate 110/night for holiday weekend compared to surrounding comparable hotels. The Cons: Hotel is oddly located behind the Residence Inn, across from the Doubletree, right next to the 56 freeway, gas station and Taco Bell, very small workout room and pool. The Pros: The outside appears bland but clean, the large inside lobby has a very relaxing welcoming set up, plenty of comfortable nice looking furniture seating areas, with roomy space and layout. Free Coffee and tea available all day in the lounge/breakfast area. Professional, welcoming customer service at check in and out, we were allowed to check in early about 0100. The included breakfast was very good, fresh and plenty of nice choices, great deal to be included in the nightly rate. There was eggs with ham, thick potato wedges, fresh fruit, tasty breads/muffins, fresh oatmeal, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee, tea. Our room was roomy/clean, the ac worked well, bed felt great, nice linen/towels, freeway noise not too loud, good internet connection included. Free parking available in their lot and underground parking also. Within 15-20 mins. to La Jolla and downtown San Diego, very close to beaches. We were very happy and impressed with the service, our room, the hotel's large welcoming lobby setup, the wonderful breakfast, the great rate and relative proximity to other San Diego locations. We will definitely recommend and return to this Hampton.",Good
"We stayed 4 nights. There were three of us so the third person had a sofa bed in the lounge area. The good things were the location, free wifi and the staff seemed nice. We asked for a quiet room when we booked and so glad we did. It meant no view but we slept well. It is a bit dated and there was a very odd smell to the room. Only one lift in use throughout our stay. Overall it did the job with no frills. Next time I think I'll go for something newer or with character. The lobby area seemed new and really smart, it didn't match the rooms. Hello bn1,Thank you for taking the time to share your stay experiences with us.

"We stayed from Wednesday to Friday in December 2017. Reservation was made on line. I also had a Friends Family Discount Voucher. Front Desk Rep would not accept it. Stated that the reservation was not made that way Explain Pls Just repeated what was said earlier. The reservations was made correctly with the Corporate Code. All I had to do was present Voucher upon check in Spoke to the Operations Director the next day. She couldn't do it either. And stated you got a good rate anyway I would have gotten a lower rate if they honored it and would have proven that the Corporate programs works. Oh well...Next issue parking fee of 20/night. Other Marriot Hotels waive the fee if you are a Calif. AAA member. Brought it up and was told: we don't do that here Ok, I can accept that. However, parking on property is underground and VERY LIMITED. If you drive in and no spaces, you need to back up all the way out. Had to park on the street both nights (which would have been FREE). Other than that, the room was clean and spacious enough. Closet space was small but adequate for the length of stay. I like the pull out desk/table. The shower soap was smallL. Could not get a good grasp on it. It was not larger than 2 flash drives end-to-end and just a little bit wider. That's it. I kept dropping it.

"If you want the Bourbon Street experience, then this is a great hotel for you. I was recently there on business so I requested an interior room rather than a balcony overlooking Bourbon Street. The room was very quiet and cozy. The fitness center is very small and does not offer a lot of options. It is an interior room with no windows, which makes you feel like your working out in a basement. The ceilings are also low and I almost hit the light fixtures with the weights a couple of times, and with my head on the elliptical machine. The staff was very nice and friendly, however, they failed to advise me that they would be working on the hot water lines from 7am -7pm, so I ended up taking a cold shower with water pressure that was very low.

"I had stayed at the hotel in October with my bf. The room was on the smaller side but very comfortable, clean and modern. The location was good, right by the airport. For us, the noise of the airplanes did not bother us. Once and awhile you noticed it but nothing crazy that we couldnt sleep. But what do you expect youre by an airport. They have a really nice shower with a sliding door for privacy. No lock on the door but it slides shut for privacy. Also had a fridge which was a plus as well as a coffee maker :) Down in the lobby they had a station called refresh, and that was really cool. You could get food, snacks and ice cream. That made it easy because you didnt have to leave the hotel to get snacks if you were hungry. They had an outside sitting area which was really chic and modern. It was nice to watch the planes fly in. Another awesome feature was they had a 24 hr. gym and it was a nice one. Not sure about the pool hrs. but they had a nice sized pool there as well. Only problem we had encountered was with the gate. We could never get it to work when we left and entered, Always had to bug the poor girl inside to open it for us. Other than that it was a beautiful modern hotel with great amenities, clean rooms and a friendly sharply dressed staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again. I loved how modern this hotel was and how it had everything we needed that I actually want to go to some of their other hotels in random states just to try them out too.",Good

I booked my room online and thought I booked the nice new tower again since I kept clicking on The Chelsea and not the Annex. To my surprise when I arrived I walked into a dirty room with stains on the sheets. The chair in the room looked from the 70's with stains as well, was afraid to sit on the bed. When I returned to the front desk to speak with the manager and get a nicer room in the tower I booked or refund my money, he was very rude and arrogant. He refused to refund and said I booked wrong even though I kept telling him I kept clicking on The Chelsea. The customer service was horrible the room was dirty and needless to say I lost out on 240 for a poor quality room I did not spend the night. Don't go!!",Bad
"The only thing nice that we saw here was the pool, which looked clean and fresh (unfortunately, I didn't bring a suit). The place has very, very old and beat up furniture and was either too hot or too cold -- the heating systems are terrible, built under the window as in older cheap properties and then the beds are behind some sliding doors, so you have to leave those doors open if you want any cooling. The breakfast in the morning is really disgusting. They seem to have people making the breakfast who know nothing about what coffee is supposed to look like, for example, or what bacon strips look like. They had a whole container full of picnic bacon, which is just scraps of pork in no particular shape, generally used as bacon pieces for other foods. And here it is in their hot breakfast like you are supposed to dive in and just eat those bacon scraps as if they are slices of morning bacon. Not me!The coffee maker in the room saved the day for us, because it was actually much better than expected. In a general sense, this room was not the quality that we expected for what we paid, and we were generally disappointed. Complicating the situation, we asked for a wake up call at 10:06 PM one night, and they promised to call. We were never awakened and it caused some big problems. I hope the attached photos help people understand why they should avoid this property.Dear Lindaj99,Very sorry to hear you were so disappointed with us during your recent stay.our main goal is to make sure all our guest have an enjoyable stay.Sorry we fell short of your expectations. the hotel will be having a full renovation towards the end of March.We hope you will give us a chance to serve you again.Thank you again for your comments.Best Regards,Laura BensonOperations ManagerComfort Suites MV",Bad
Would not stay here again. We arrived at the hotel around 12 noon. We were told their were no rooms ready and to come back in a couple hours. We returned in a couple hours but room not ready yet. We waited 3 1/2 hours for a room. We then got the room directly across from the elevator. The door wouldn't open. Very noisy trying to sleep. Breakfast was not good. Coffee maker broken. Manager finally talked to us after waiting 3 1/2 hours and gave us a discount. We cancelled our stay and moved hotels. Best choice ever! Best part was shuttle driver Travis. Loved him!,Bad
The most dirty hotel I have ever seen! I wonder if Choice Hotel group does any inspection for hotels owed by the company. Every inch of the hotel is unclean. If you want to enjoy your trip and cherish the natural beauty of the Estes Park never think about to stay in this hotel,Bad

"First, perfect location for PETCO, Convention, and Gas Lamp!Spent 3 nights at Solamar for a convention. First upon arrival I was quickly greeted by the valet and taken care of. They offered bag service but I was okay handling my own. I checked-in quickly with Q and headed straight up to the room on the 7th floor. When I arrived at my room the door was open. It was rather strange but I made sure I knocked and called out because I didn't want to walk in on anything I didn't want to see :)The room was clean. I had a window with a view of another building. Nothing too much there. The TV was massive and to be honest was pleasant because I didn't sacrifice my NFL experience away from home. Here's where my experience got a little ruff. At 4:30 am I was woke up by a screaming child in the adjacent room. I get it, kids are kids, but this screaming was more of an attention getting scream because there was no crying, just screaming. So I tried to sleep and eventually the child stopped screaming. Then at 6:30 the kid was playing and screaming at the same time. That was it, no more sleep for the day. I got up to take a shower just to leave, and that was when I noticed the shower head was leaking from the top, mildew in the tile cracks, and heavy mildew at the drain. Blocked that out of my head and just showered up. I will say the water pressure is on point. When I returned to the room later that day I tried to just relax, and then the kid started screaming. I didn't want to judge the kid and become angry so I called the front desk. Q answered and I explained to him what was going on. He even mentioned on the phone that he could hear the kid through the phone. He quickly provided me two options, I chose one and I was set for the rest of the trip. I moved to the 8th floor, view of the pool and not a peep from anyone or anything. In summary, Q is the reason my review is 4 stars. He saved my trip and experience. I was able to sleep uninterrupted! I knocked the score one point for the cleanliness of the bathroom in 706. The 8th floor bathroom was noticeably cleaner (816). Thanks for a great experience Q and Solamar. Will consider this location as an option in the future!Thank you CAm2317 for this detailed and candid review. I couldn't be happier to see that Q saved the day on your seemingly frustrating visit. I'm very sorry for the experience you had. I have shared your feedback regarding the door having been left open and the shower issue with our Executive Housekeeper for follow up with our team. That feedback is very concerning, it has not been taken lightly and will be used as a training opportunity for our team to ensure that such an experience does not repeat itself. Please feel free to contact me prior to your next visit and I will ensure you have a fantastic visit. Thank you again for writing. All my best, Shannon shannon.fosterhotelsolamar.com",Good
We booked this hotel due to location as I was departing from an evening meeting and it was 2.5 hours away so it gave us a good start for the next day. The hotel was up to Hampton Inn standards. When we arrived in the room and got in bed we noticed we were on the side of the hotel... More,Good
"Really helpful, fun and friendly front office staff. My room was perfect - lovely view of the needle and Seattle Centre. Studio option was a brilliant choice. Lots of space, very comfy bed, good amenities. Close to QFC to grab goodies. Hotel shuttle will take you places within a one mile radius. Wifi connection strong and free. Buffet breakfast adequate although not fancy, but pastries were delicious! Access to snacks (to buy) and a bar in the evening. Would stay here again. Ride the Ducks is very close and a must do!!! Heaps of fun )TracyDan102013,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences.

"Me and a friend stayed here on the last leg of our 6 week American adventure for 3 nights. When we arrived the first receptionist was quite short and boderline rude however the manager took over (Gutted I can't remember his name) and he could not have been more helpful. We had a few conversations with him and he was a genuinely lovely man who couldn't have been more helpful.There are no lifts in this hotel, however the aforementioned manager helped us up the many stairs with our luggage. I have never stayed in a shared bathroom hotel before but it was not as bad as I envisioned. They were always immaculate and never too much of a wait as there were 3 toilets on our floor.I would say if you are a younger traveller this may not be the hotel for you as we did get told off for laughing too loudly with some travellers from neighbouring rooms, however this was completely justified, just if you're after a more lively scene, pick a hotel with sound proofed rooms! There are no TV's in the room's and they are quite small but if, like us, you are after a relaxed vibe when you get in, this is great. (Another reviewer compared this hotel to 'staying at grandma's' and I couldn't agree more)The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. In some parts of San Fran I did feel slightly unsafe but could not fault the location of the San Remo at all, a quieter, friendly area. Opposite there is a great little cafe, Caffe Cappiccio (Helpful as the hotel does not provide a breakfast), some bars (our favourite being La Rocas) and a 10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The restaurant of the hotel was absolutely brilliant. The food was delicious and there was a fantastic band playing while we were eating who also did a great rendition of happy birthday to my friend.All in all, this hotel was a great little find and I would love to see what the penthouse is like!Again, thank you to the manager, your customer service was impeccable.Thank you so much for your comments and feedback. Our staff are well-trained and expected to help our guests above and beyond, just like Kenley (our manager) did. We will look into the front desk staff you mentioned, as we are in the hospitality business and expect the best from our staff.Besides being close to many famous attractions, our neighborhood is very safe. We are very glad that you felt comfortable walking around here. The Fior d'Italia is America's oldest Italian restaurant and our guests get 10 discount. We hope you will choose to stay with us again in your next trip to the US.",Good
"Now, of course this is not a huge Time Share resort or anything like that . But looking at hotels like the Comfort Inn, Best Western , Etc ... this is how i view this hotel. And it is specifically the one at the Airport in Philly. This is a great hotel easily my favorite out of them all. Whenever we go away Internationally or within the USA we always stay here. Also love the Park and fly where they watch your car while you are away. This hotel did something for us that no other hotel has ever done . When we went away to Paris many years ago while we were sleeping they sent their driver out overnight and in the morning they gave us 2 Plane pillows to have on the flight. Those are a good 20 each . Just to say have a good time. Who does that !!! As a TY we brought them back some souvenirs and try to always give them something when we come back. We also Love the breakfast. Always at least 2 hots included and there are waffles you can make . Food has never run out . Recently late late at night the coffee was a little cold. I would have dealt with it but they insisted on me having hot coffee. They tied me up and made me wait for it . It was not so bad because i also had a cookie . If you have a flight before breakfast they have bag breakfast you can take with you. Of course drink the water before you get to the airport. The Park and Fly is great nice to know your car is safe while you are away. There is a Ruby Tuesday right next door too if you want dinner. When we got there they offered a wine as an arrival treat. Also a new nice touch is they actually when they pick you up at the airport offer to take you back to the HI for a nice drink before you leave . This is new and a nice thing to do. The only things i can say that would be better is work something out with the restaurant next door where maybe we get a discount or something. HI must give them a TON of business. A lot of places we stay we get a discount at the adjoining restaurant when you show your room card. Also it was a bit confusing in the airport looking for the kiosk that has the HI number to call for pickup. They moved everything and i wandered around looking for it never found it. Luckily i saw the van outside and he waited while we got the luggage. Other then that it is our favorite hotel to stay at for the Airport Stay.Thank you for your kind words and feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We look forward to serving you again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales",Good
"When you see a hotel in a great location in Atlanta costing about 80 per night, you know it's not going to be the Holiday Inn. I saw the bad reviews, but none of the complaints proved true, the hot water worked fine. Other than the seam in the carpet being visible, a most uneven floor, and a TV a little far from the bed, there was nothing to criticize. The room was clean and large with a sofa, small fridge, microwave, and comfortable bed. Some may be offended because the bathroom is small and the lavatory is in the room. Virginia Highlands is a great, downtown neighborhood with great restaurants. One block away is the very nice and reasonably priced hipster Sweet Auburn BBQ which is not traditional BBQ, but good. Within a few blocks are residential streets listed on the historic register because of their unique architecture. The neighborhood feels safe. The King Center, Carter Center, and Fernbank Science Museum are no more than 5-10 minutes by car depending on the traffic. For the same price you can stay at an econolodge near a mall at an interstate exit with newer carpet. Thank you for taking the time to leave such an extensive and wonderful review of the hotel. We love that you appreciate our uniqueness and that you were able to truly experience our neighborhood. Please come back and visit us again soon!Best wishes, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn",Good
"Great new hotel near Marysville. The hotel is clean and quiet. The hotel is close to Costco, Target, Seattle Premium Outlets, many restaurants and the Tulalip Resort and Casino. We would stay here again!",Good
"As others have said, this is a great little place within a few blocks of the Fisherman's Wharf area. It is clean and well kept, and the staff were very good. Noah at the front desk was very informative and up on the weather around the bay area as well. We stayed here two different nights in one week, before and after our travels into wine country, and were very satisfied. We chose The Columbus Motor Inn rather than some possibly bigger named places because of the price, but more for the assurance that we would have a parking space at our hotel and not have to search the downtown streets for parking, or pay some outrageous fee to park after we already were paying the hotel. What a great decision as parking was a real PITA in the city, everywhere. If you could find parking on the streets, most of it was metered, and some questionable. If you were lucky to find a safe looking garage, it was expensive. On the wharf they wanted 7 per hour, so we just walked from the hotel! Factor that into your decision. The rooms were comfortable and the flat-screen TV was nice as well. I'll make this one of my favorite places for certain! I'll post a picture taken from our room looking down Columbus toward the pyramid and the Coit Tower.",Good
"We were excited to stay at this hotel based on a friend's recommendation. It's in a great location -- near the Gaslamp district and within walking distance of the Convention Center. The dcor is modern and trendy. We enjoyed the hotel's daily happy hour at 5 pm.We were surprised at the noise level from Room 619, there is no soundproofing, at all -- you can hear guests from adjacent rooms as if they were actually in your room. The noise from the hallway carries, as well as the noise from the 4th floor lounge/pool area!We had an early check-out on February 5. After checking with the staff the evening before, I was assured that it would not be a problem. The morning of our departure, the attendant on duty said he was unable to provide my receipts because he was running a process, but that he would e-mail them to me. Because this was work-related travel, I was explicit with what I needed him to e-mail me. I received an e-mail 1-1/2 hours later, it was missing one of two receipts I requested. I called the hotel upon landing in Baltimore and asked the attendant to e-mail the room receipt. Nothing. I called again at 7:24 p.m. and Martha (I believe) finally e-mailed the receipt.We parked a vehicle on site. The valets were always helpful. The 41 per day valet fee is steep considering some of the other hotels allow self-parking for 30.If we visit San Diego again, we'll look at other hotels before re-booking at this one.Hello Erp757,Thanks for the review. Were happy you enjoyed our location and happy hour with local beer and wine. Sorry about the receipt mishap- bad timing on our part. We find that our parking prices match those in the area with secured, in-and-out privileges. Hopefully you will give us another shot to impress you. Thanks again.",Neutral
"We had a good stay. The location is a little bit away from the French Quarter. I would have liked to be just a little closer for safe walking, but we were fine . There are always taxi cabs right outside. The pool was nice and refreshing . A nice courtyard to sit at. The breakfast was good. It was clean. A little dreary but good for the price and location. Inside parking for a price 21 dollars . Limited though , on a first come basis . No microwave in room , but one in lobby to use. Frig in room and a coffee pot . Bar in the lobby. Good air conditioning! We would stay again if passing this way again.",Good

"Estancia is very nicely secluded, very quiet with a fantastic staff. The valet guys were super friendly, the concierge was helpful and the ladies taking care of our rooms did great. The pool was very nice and all the on site restaurants were fantastic. It is secluded. Depending on your view of this it can be a bit of a drive to other eating establishments in Del Mar or La Jolla. We will certainly return. It was highly recommended by our friends as well.",Good
"Me and my boyfie we stayed in Casa Loma Hotel for 3 nights and find the experience is not as good as we thought it could be. It was end of the year of 2015, the weather is very cold for us who came from the South East Asia country, what's to be mentioned of our dissatisfaction is the heater in which we were told is centralized that our room is freezing cold even we have requested to adjust the temperature. The service at the front desk as we are noticing the people are keep changing throughout our stay, there are one or two who are on the night shift, the respond to the request of services are rather poor and inefficient, perhaps the hotel can improve on managing the people, we felt we are not properly taken care of. Nevertheless, when we ask for directions or some other questions regarding the area, especially people who are in the morning shift at the front desk are very helpful and friendly. We are glad to have free hot drinks at the lobby and also maps travel guide conveniently provided - especially the Big Bus Tour tickets are available to get from the hotel! Last but not least, the condition of the room is considerably fine, as we booked the room with private bathroom, however the bathroom, on one of the night when it was raining around the area of San Francisco, the hot bath doesn't seems to work properly and we were extremely cold after taking shower, despite the hotel has provided us extra blanket, yet we do hope the hotel will improve on the condition of the room :)",Bad

I stayed here on my last night of a week long vaca. Room was average but what I expected. You are close to a major road so not the quietest hotel if you are a light sleeper. No public laundry room. There is a Cracker Barrel and a Waffle House right there for breakfast. Staff were pleasant,Neutral
"The staff at this hotel are very rude. We would never recommend this hotel. The cleaning people do not speak English. Mildew in the bathroom. The weather was cold down there, the staff kept the air conditioner on in the lobby and hallways and would not turn the heat on even after several people complained.",Bad
"Just finished a 2 night stay. There were a few positives but my initial 3/5 evaluation was influenced downward by the unfavourable opinions of my brother and adult son who traveled with me. Pluses included a breakfast with hot options and adequate space for seating, not always a given. The front end staff were friendly. The room was good value for a name brand this time of year.The small room however was below par in several ways. Had I been with my wife, I would have requested a move. Most critically, it was excessively musty smelling, noticeable as the door opened. The carpet felt damp and the issue was illustrated by the delamination on the doors of the cabinet. This had to be an undoing issue. There was a large piece of sticky green gum stuck to the seat of the lounge chair, impossible to miss during housekeeping. The toilet ran constantly. Lessor issues include limited toiletries such as a single bar of soap to share between the sink and (separate) shower areas. The lighting in the shower area was weak leaving the shower in shadow. All in all, given the miriad of options in the area, I'd suggest guests look elsewhere.",Bad

No regular coffee in the rooms, only decaf. Was told you had to order regular coffee from room service.... which I did, and it never showed up. No one at the desk had a clue about that either.

"In a way this is a no-frills hotel - pretty basic room, though everything is very comfortable, clean, and the best thing it has so much PERSONALITY! They have little cards for every day on your bed, and our room even had a goldfish bowl - WITH A FISH in it...they had a plaque letting us know his name was Pressley :) Tons of fun little things around the Pearl for you central though not super near any beach.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, THANK YOU for your great review.

It was an overall pleasant stay and there is no reason that I wouldn't return.Hi madeinukeng - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us.

"I thought this was an above average hotel in a fantastic location.Room: Modern, clean, very comfortable and quiet rooms. They are slightly small but this is typical for hotels I have stayed in in SF. The discreet in-room recycling bins were a nice touch.Hotel Facilities: Not much. There is a very small fitness room and 'business centre'. We didn't use the restaurant - there are excellent dinning options very near by. The staff were helpful. Location: Great location near Union Square and Chinatown. SF is a very easy city to explore - tip: buy a MUNI pass and use it hop on and off the regular busses and the cable cars, too!",Good

"Stayed there for 3 nights and can't wait to get out. Upon check in, there was no smile, or welcome, front desk staff looked really tired. Upon entering the room, small pieces of trash found next to sofa and bed, sign of not vacuuming. Upon entering the bathroom, ultra small space, broken towel handle, only 2 towels on rack. No sheets for sofa bed although we stated the room was for 2 adults and 2 kids. Called for sheets and pillows, went out to dinner and back, still nothing. 9am, went to front desk to get our sheets. I mean, we really don't mind to stop by the front desk if the staff had told us that she's busy. Communication broken right there. Breakfast is nothing to write home about which we expected. Breakfast area very tight and small, if you're going to eat during busy time, go early, otherwise, no table for you. Next day went to visit Atlanta, came back at night found that both bed and sofa bed were made, satisfaction didn't last 2 seconds when seeing our pillows and our kids' stuff animals were on the floor. Obviously, the maid came to make bed, threw everything on the floor, and forgot to pick them up. But that also tell us how inconsiderate were they. Would you ever throw your bed pillows on floor, and Did I mention if they even vacuum. Would not recommend, there is Residence Inn just 2 minutes away. We didn't use their kitchen, so no commend on it, we just need a place a little bigger since we have kids.Thank you for your survey. I am truly sorry about your experience with our hotel. I will address all the matters you have detailed with housekeeping, front desk and food service. Again, I am sorry for not meeting your expectations.",Bad

"We stayed here for three nights while visiting Disneyland. We had two rooms, one standard (for the in-laws) and one suite. We booked the suite in order to have a separate sleeping room for the kids. The extra room, however, was very small (just enough room to unfold the bed) and couldn't be used for much more than sleeping (it had no TV). Strangely, the extra room also lacked any heat (it only had a cooling unit). We were in Anaheim during a cold spell in January so this was problematic but didn't ruin our stay.The standard room seemed a bit more updated than the suite but, aside from some peeling paint, both rooms were clean and comfortable. The hot breakfast was perfect (selection included belgian waffles, eggs, sausages, toast, pastries, cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit) but, as has been noted by other reviews, the seating area is woefully inadequate. Fortuntately, we weren't there during a busy time so the lack of room was more of a nuisance than anything else.I estimated the walk to Disneyland front gates to be about a mile. For us, it took 15 to 20 minutes, which was what we expected.Service was friendly and attentive. All in, given the price, we thought the value was excellent and would stay here again.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay with us. I am checking into the issue you had with no heat in the suites extra room. I am also having the bathrooms repainted as we speak. I will speak to our staff again about reporting any issues about the rooms to me. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I assure you that they will be fixed by your next visit.",Good

"Ben, the receptionist, was very very friendly so the first impression was a big surprise! The motel looks clean and is located next to the highway in Atlanta Downtown. As you can imagine opening the window is a bad idea because it's getting very noisy but if you leave them closed you won't hear the cars that much. I was able to sleep like a baby :)If you visit Atlanta without a car, no worries, nearly every attraction (Georgia Aquarium, Coke museum, etc) is in walking distance. A MARTA station is about 10min away.On our floor there were vending machines (snacks and drinks) and the prices were reasonable. The room is quite big, for 2 persons it's enough room. The interior is a bit worn out but the price is more than fair.",Good

"My partner booked a two night stay at this hotel on my 1st visit to Orlando. I was pleasantly surprised as to how nice it was considering the places we drove past on a daily basis. First impressions were great, the hotel was clean and contemporary (evidently fairly new and well kept). All staff were very friendly and accomadating to our needs. The room was great, the kitchenette area had everything we needed and more. Not the best view but it was definitely comfortable. LOVED the jacuzzi and made good use of the gym even though the stay was short. Breakfast was nice and filling and I remember us ordering a pizza from the downstairs restaurant which wasnt bad at all either.

Huge about 6 m long bathroom with the mirror allover the wall. Separate walk-in rainy shower and separate WC. Luxury bathroom amenities. Digital touch everywhere in the room. WiFi is free of charge. What I found as disappointed is breakfast..if you want buffet breakfast the chosen food are so poor...just eggs and bacon, some sweets...nothing else for 26 USD!!!. Really shame. Try to have breakfast somewhere else.Dear Nikac, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago and taking time to write about your experience. I'm so glad you enjoyed every aspect of our guest room, found it to be comfortable, convenient and up to date with our improved technology.

"This was my first trip. Ingrid, at the front desk was very helpful reserving a swamp tour and recommending a restaurant. Very convenient location, 2 block walk to the French Quarter. Yes, there were renovations going on, but no noise until 8am. Maybe a problem if you are out partying to 2 am...but I wanted to enjoy the sights, so it was not any inconvenience. The croissant delivered to my door every morning was HUGE, and wonderfully flaky. The staff was helpful with directions and letting me know what areas were safe to walk in. The beds were very comfortable and I slept well each night. The microwave and mini fridge in the room are very handy amenities to have. I am diabetic, and having the fridge/ micro make life much easier when traveling. The worst thing about my trip was a Boil water alert was called (it happens once in a while in this area) but the hotel handed out bottled water to the guests until the area wide situation was resolved. Thank you Ingrid, for making my trip a wonderful memory. I am already planning a trip for next year and will not hesitate to stay at the St. James again.Dear H S,Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us. We are pleased that the staff was helpful and the amenities were able to accommodate your needs.

Close to the French Quarter without the noise. Walked almost everywhere. Breakfast saved a lot of time cost. Parking was on site so less loading and packing up. Pool was quaint. The hotel has an elevator. Needs a microwave to keep the family happy. Thank you Guest for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate all the great comments to help our future guests know our prime location. Having on-site parking does help our guests with convenience and our pool and courtyard are a great place to sit back and relax after a long day of touring.

"Estancia is a lovely hotel with manicured grounds. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable. The hotel itself is a bit of a maze and the staff are not very helpful in directing you to your room. We finally found our rooms and by the end of our stay we felt we finally knew where we were going. The restaurant where breakfast was served was chaotic. You had to wait 20 to 30 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables. Menu prices were average for a hotel. The server couldn't seem to get the order correct and it was 45 minutes before our food arrived. Unfortunately, we were not the only customers unhappy with the service. We could hear complaints from many of the tables. The excuse was a computer problem. We would probably stay at the hotel again but we will definitely make arrangements to eat elsewhere.Thank you for choosing to stay with us and thank you for taking the time to post a review. We appreciate your feedback regarding the guest rooms and grounds, and were so happy that you enjoyed the new beds. The hotels unique layout can certainly come across as a maze at first- just remember that you actually enter the property on the third level!

The hotel is exquisite in its decor. The staff can not be anymore friendly and ready to accommodate you. Every evening between 5-6pm with your room key there is free Proseco or Sangria in the lobby bar area. And believe me all the guests take advantage of it. Right now they are doing a bit of construction so there are some noisy periods but besides that no complaints. Rooms decent size for downtown. Love their amenities. Bonus there is a Starbucks connected to the hotel on the first floor. I usually am not disappointed by a Kimpton property and I can add this one to the list.

"If you want a hotel close to the French Quarter rather than in it with all its noise, crowds and street entertainers and scam artists this is the perfect place. You are only four blocks from Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street or the streetcar stops right outside the hotel if you don't feel like walking. 3 for a 24 hour pass is a good deal and an easy way to move around all the key tourist areas. The Drury Inn offers excellent accommodation for the money: we had an oversized 2 room suite King Bed Non-Smoking suite for five nights which was clean, comfortable, well laid out. The Breakfast and Kick Back offerings should be seen as a bonus: it's quite naturally geared to US tastes and if you like what's on offer then enjoy (we did for the most part) if not then there are plenty of good eating spots within easy reach. As for the three alcoholic drinks each night what's to complain about Just be aware there are quite long lines on Friday and Saturday nights.

Only complaint could be that the T.V was very small compared to the standard of the room.Staff were great and always on point.I used the Hyatt Gym everyday and found it to be immaculate and never tooo busy.Only bummer was to pay for internet but at check out the lady asked if I wanted to join up to the Hyatt gold scheme and I did and then the internet was free but unless I had done that the internet was not free which considering the normal rate of the rooms is a little bit much in my opinion. On the subject of cost, I was on a discounted room rate but if I did take the going rate....all I can say is that if you want quality like this....expect to pay for it.Me and my girlfriend enjoyed and were comfortable every minute we were in the hotel.Thank you so much for your review.

We stayed 2 nights at this motel. It was a pretty basic room without a refrigerator or microwave. It was clean and owners were friendly. It appeared that the bathroom had been recently updated. It has a pool and grill area which families used quite often. Rates were fairly reasonably for this time of year in the Old Forge area.,Neutral
"After reading the reviews on trip advisor before departing, I headed straight to my travel agent to enquire about a transfer to a different hotel, but was persueded to give it a try. So armed with my bleach wipes and can of oust we arrived at the hotel. However, I need not have worried, as I was not greeted by a musty smell at reception, not rude staff. I entered our room apprehensively, and although it was very dated and basic, it was perfect for our familys needs. Cleanish, with a fridge and tv, room service everyday, and friendly, helpfull staff.The free breakfast was ok for a few days of the holiday, but there are only so many meals you can eat off of a polystyrene plate lol. The best thing about the hotel was it's fantastic location. Situated right behing a KFC, and Walgreens 24hr supermarket and right in the middle of International drive, we couldn't have asked for better. Universal is around a 15 minute walk from the hotel, but it's a lovely walk with beautiful gardens and little lakes on the way there. You are also only 2 minutes away from Wet Wild and a whole load of shops and restaurants.The transport links here are fantastic all the way up down I drive, and the stops are seconds away from the hotel. The free shuttle bus can be very busy, escpecially in the morning and on the 8pm and 10pm return buses from Disney. If you're only off to Aquatica for example, you are better hopping on the I trolley as it only costs 1.25 and your almost always guaranteed a seat.The pool at the hotel is open until 11pm, and its heated, so a welcome relief to your sore feet after a hard day at the parks or shopping.All in all, I would possibly stay here again. It is basic, but from the other reviews I have read, it is no more run down than the more expensive alternatives.",Good
"We spent the night here on our way down to Tennessee. The place is quiet and located at the top of a hill, making it very easy to find.

"This hotel was very clean and the breakfast had some hot items that are always appreciated. Our room had a scorch mark from an iron on the carpet, but otherwise was very clean. We always end up with more than we can eat at restaurants, so the refrigerator is also very welcome to store leftovers.",Good
"The Hyatt House (not to be confused with the nearby Hyatt Place) is a new hotel right by the Space Needle and monorail. My room faced the monorail track, but surprisingly I really didn't hear it at all so I was impressed with the soundproofing. It wasn't perfect though as the room also faced a TV station garage whose warning chime every time it was opened did get through and could get annoying. The room set up I had was like a one bedroom apartment with a kitchenette that was stocked with cooking utensils, pots, pans, plates, silverware, etc and a separate bedroom with a door. Bathroom had a large shower with the good water pressure (no tub). The free breakfast buffet was great with eggs, potatoes, a meat (sausage, bacon, or ham), and a variable dish (pancake, biscuit and sausage gravy). There were also fruit, yogurt, cereal, and toast options plus the omelette station (you might have to wait a while though depending on time). Fitness room had a few treadmills, ellipticals, bicycles, dumbbells, a sort of universal, and towels. Maybe a spray bottle and paper towels or wet wipes to wipe down handles and bench might have been nice. Overall, I really liked the hotel and best of all it was reasonably priced -- less expensive than meeting-sponsored hotels near the convention center (about a mile away).Masahiro K,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge",Good
"Pros: Solid location, cute old fashioned decor (loved the old school elevator, clean, and friendly service. Cons: Unbelievably small room. I mean comically small. My friend and I literally laughed upon entering the room. There was a twin sized bed with maybe 3 feet of room on all three sides of it before hitting the wall. Bathroom was roughly half the size of the room itself. No air conditioning. Luckily we were only staying one night. If we had paid for a room for two and booked this place for a week I think we would have gone mad. It was a corner room so maybe the other rooms are more spacey but regardless the room we were given should be used for storage.Also the breakfast was very poor. Weak spread, ran out of food and dishes/cutlery. I ate cereal out of a coffee mug. Chose that over toast with store bought pastries and cold coffee. If you get room 410 please ask for a different room...",Bad

We paid for an upgrade once we got there and I'm so glad we did, the room was spacious and I slept like a rock! I would definitely stay there again. The only drawback is that everything around the hotel closes relatively early so make sure to grab dinner early or plan to go to another area of the city.Hey Natalieaz9!Thanks for the 5 star review!!

"1st time we went to this hotel in SF. I was a little cautious with low expectations due to the decent deal i got online with them. Only good surprises: Very nice staff, used to deal with international visitors and making the effort to speak other languages. Rooms are a little small but their design is tasteful. We had a comfortable bed, enjoyed a quiet sleep with almost no noise. If the hotel does not provide breakfast other than Coffee or tea, there' s a chinese 'diner' type at the next corner that will fulfill your needs for cheap.I ll go back there for my next trip in SFDear NicoCT,Thank you so much for offering your comments.

Stayed at the Hotel Zephyr for two nights. Whilst the hotel was going through a refurbishment and the lobby was very cramped and proved too small at times when large parties of guests arrived.... the rooms themselves were well equipped - had been refurbished to a good standard - on a nautical theme and generally were very comfortable. The staff were very attentive and provided a good level of customer care. Whilst the restaurant was undergoing refurbishment it really didn't matter as there was a good I-Hop next door for breakfast and within a couple of minutes walk you are right on Fishersmans Wharf which have some spectacular restaurants and attractions to visit. The location couldn't be faulted and I would certainly stay at the hotel again.,Good

"this was a excellent choice for me and my family, we were there for 5 days and was not ready to leave. If ever back in New Orleans I won't have to look far for a nice place to reside while I'm here.I took the time to do a review because I often read them to help me make a decision. Only one thing I didn't like but every h.tel now does it is a 20.00 or more to park in their parking lot. If you are there for more than three days I think there should be a charge. So only 1 complaint for a 5 day stay is pretty darn good,",Good
"Cheap price, found out why, had ants all over the bathroom floor at night and we had a second floor room! The room itself was clean but worn down, big old TV (not plasma) and the remote didn't work. The only plus was the convenience of being within a few minutes of the airport, which is the only reason we stayed overnight. The pool was good too.I'd only recommend it for convenience as it was dated and the International Dr. N. location was far superior in quality and cleanliness! That management sent an e-mail to survey their hotel after our stay, hmm, wonder why this place didn't send us the same company e-mail",Neutral
"We stayed in the BW Plus Bayside for 4 nights in August. For us the hotel was in a great position. It was a short walk from the Sante Fe station, a short walk to the Westfield Mall and the Gaslight Quarter, a very short walk to Little Italy and a 20 minute walk from Petco Park. We took a bus to the San Diego Zoo from the Sante Fe station. San Diego is a lovely city for sightseeing and getting around easily.The hotel was lovely, we had a room overlooking the harbour. The bed was large and very comfortable. The pillows were also good. It was always clean.Breakfast is served in the next door restaurant and we found this to be good. Always got a table. The buffet items were plentiful and we have no complaints. It saved us trying to buy breakfast at extortionate rates elsewhere. The staff were all happy and helpful. We would stay here again the next time we visit.Thank you for reviewing your stay at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn. We are pleased you enjoyed our proximity to: the mall, train station, Little Italy the Gaslamp District! Seems like you had a great time exploring downtown San Diego. We are glad you enjoyed our complimentary breakfast buffet and comfortable bedding... we look forward to welcoming you back!",Good
"I stayed here for a weekend in September. The good- big room, best continental breakfast I've ever had at a hotel, very friendly staff. The gym also looked great. I was bummed because I picked the hotel for the free shuttle service. I even called and spoke with someone and they confirmed it was not too good to be true. Unfortunately, it is not offered on the weekends. This place would be perfect to stay during the week- free breakfast and dinner, a shuttle downtown, etc. First, we were put in a room that smelled moldy and then the toilet overflowed- which means the toilet must have been leaking for a while. They were polite about it and got us set up in a new room that smelled much better. We also booked a second room for a relative and hers was nice, too. Overall, I recommend it and I would stay here again. It's a good bargain- but as another reviewer said, you need a car.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your guest experience and feedback. I am pleased you had an overall good experience.

The Coffee Shop was also expensive. No big issues, just an average hotel that did a job for us.Thank you for sharing your experience with me, it always helps to get feedback.

"I have stayed here many times since 2005 I am never disappointed. The new rooms in the new addition are great. Really big and spacious. Plus the evening meal and the morning breakfast are a wonderful addition. After visiting museums and shopping all day, we didn't want to go out to restaurant. The evening meal offered baked potatoes, grilled chicken, pasta, salad, hot dogs chili. We put together a nice meal without having to leave the hotel. Then the next morning, we had a complete breakfast before heading off to the Aquarium. All the staff were very professional helpful. Thank you Drury Inn.",Good
"We stayed for about a week. Beds were plush and very comfortable. Ours had a king sofa bed. A nice counter sized fridge is included, and the room had an extra sink. Suites are a large room with a short (4 ft) divider. There were lots of AC outlets including on lamps on the desk and 2 near the bed . Internet speed was excellent, averaging 5Mb/sec. Pricing is lower if you stay 5 days.The hotel has a small pool and exercise room. 24hr fitness, with lots of machines and weights is across the street and free to guests. Staff is happy, friendly and helpful.Breakfast was surprisingly good. Eggs were real, with cereal, fresh fruit, oatmeal, yogurt and pastries. Coffee and Tea (Bigelow bags) are served 24/7. Best of all, the hot water didn't taste like coffee! Dinner was just OK. There are better choices in the area.Location: Off I-5, but takes 10-15 min (in rush hr) due to one-way streets/traffic. Immediate exit onto I-5. It is a 12 min walk from the Airport train. It is not downtown, but it's close (15-20 min). The Space needle and museum complex is about a 15 min walk. The neighborhood to the northwest is full of newly constructed apartments, plus many cafes and upscale restaurants. There is a whole foods (7 min walk) with a huge deli/bakery/salad bar if you want something cheap easy, but no nearby convenience store. (Don't miss Market House on Howell for corned beef!) Walk east across I-5 (up Denny Olive)) and you'll find funkier neighborhoods and parks, plus cheaper (and excellent) eateries. There are many homeless people and panhandlers in the area west of the hotel. The Pikes Market/waterfront is 15-20 min on foot. A giant REI is a block away and worth visiting. It's also the non-hotel food in the evening.Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review -- these kinds of tips are always helpful for our newer guests.

"While the hotel is clean and in an excellent location, you will NOT get a good night's sleep here if you have neighbors above you who need to fulfill their 10,000 daily steps in the middle of the night. Of the four nights we stayed here all four nights were full of different neighbors above us who for some reason need to walk back and forth around their room ALL NIGHT LONG, banging cabinets, doors, etc. Complaints to the house host were not helpful at all. We never got a decent night sleep here. Also, don't believe the shuttle stuff. We tried every day to get one, first being told just call 10 mins before you need one, then told you must come downstairs in person and wait, and oh by the way it would be a 40 min wait (when the shuttle only goes a 1 mile radius I do not understand). Never was able to get a shuttle the entire time we were there. The staff at the morning buffet were wonderful, friendly, but the hot food was not hot, the selection was small. And lastly, take the stairs. The elevator is S-L-O-W. We often waited more than 5 minutes. I would not stay here again, mostly because of the noise factor.Hello, Julie!Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are sorry to hear that you did not get a good nights sleep - that's the exact opposite of what we are shooting for! Noise complaints are relatively uncommon for us, and we will investigate a bit to see if anything can be done about the particular room you stayed in. I am sorry too to hear of your experience with the shuttle. I know it seems crazy, but with traffic sometimes a shuttle run for several passengers within a mile can take much longer than expected. It sounds like we could have done a much better job communicating with you though. We appreciate the feedback and will certainly use it as a training opportunity internally. Thank you again and we hope to have the chance to serve you again - with a good nights sleep!",Bad

"My family and I (2 kids 2 adults) stayed at Quality Suites San Diego Sea World Area in early Oct 2018. We stayed in a king size room with a pull out sofa bed. The king bed was very comfy but the pull out sofa wasnt comfy for the kids and wouldnt be able to accommodate an adult. You would be better to get another bedding configuration. The pull out sofa bed was in an offset room/sitting area (with a separate tv) that can be closed with a glass sliding door. The full room is compact so if you have very big bags, they wouldnt be able to be left open all the time as you probably couldnt walk past them. The kids loved the pool, and we could here a little bit of noise from where we were but not much (we were on the 3rd floor in the far corner so it was the quietest area). The breakfast and breakfast area was good. The staff were friendly and the location was central to the zoo and the airport. We used Lyft to go places. You could go across the highway to the mission valley shopping area but we didnt do that. There is a Dennys, petrol station, benihana, Wendys and another food place within several minutes walk (and a Wendys further) on the hotel side of the highway. Overall we had a good stay as it provided everything we needed for our couple of nights.Dear Guest - We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such candid feedback of your stay.

"Of the ten or so hotels I've stayed in in San Fran, the St. Regis is my favorite. Great location, lovely lobby and bar, and sleek modern rooms.

"We enjoyed our stay. It's comfortable, clean, very friendly and helpful staff. We had Valet Parking on arrival and a welcome glass of wine in the library bar (and there was a complementary glass at 5pm each eve). Great place to hang out and swap stories.The location was great for all we wanted to do. Do get a comfortable pair of sketchers (there is a shop near by buy one get second half price) as you will be walking up and down hills a lot! The air conditioning in our room 709 was a bit noisy so I was glad we did not need it much. You get a faint hum of the San Francisco sound at night which I loved and was not disturbing . We didn't dine in at all so can't comment on the food . So many eateries in San Fran. to choose from and loris for breakfast just down the hill a few yards on the same side has great choice and sensible price. We spent three nights here over a week end with another couple in the next room and we were able to shut the outer door and kept our own door open on occasions so great if you are with family or with close friends!Would certainly recommend staying here.",Good
"This place is unsafe... the camera's don't work, or atleast weren't working at the time when the police needed it for their investigation... they even had the nerve to charge me for blood stains on the carpet resulting from my attack which took place at 10 am in the morning !! The excuse was that it may have been someone I met 2 nights before that set me up ...But after much investigation and reflection it had to have been an inside job because it had nothing to do with that person as I was to later find out.But when you think about it, common sense would tell you if a hotel agent delivered items the evening before only that person could reasonably infer you would be sleeping over until the morning....be that as it may the after-care was extremely disappointing and I have stayed in many hotels... I'm still in shock to this day !!!",Bad

"Stayed here after a long flight was supposed to be for two days. But lasted one night. Was in room 210 but complained after first night due to noise from being next to the elevators and the air conditioning unit at the window and on the roof outside. Staff were indiferent to the problem said they couodnt help as the hotel was full. (All flights from NYC and Washington Area were cancelled due to storms so in bound passengers didnt arrive) the room card offered complete satisfaction or money back but this was not honoured as apoarently we had paid in advance. I assume the money that came out of my bank was coverted to play money by the time they got it so the guarantee was invalid!!!! I asked for a taxi and got their mini bus who charged 50 to go downtown. I was conned into this hotel by the Hilton brand name huge mistake on my part.Hi,We are sorry we were not able to provide you with the quality of services you deserve.

"I recently stayed at the Drury Inn for 3 nights. I was assigned a corner room on the 6th fl that had two exposures of Poydras street. I was very satisfied with the room. It was quiet (some minor street noise), very well appointed, had a nice whirlpool type jet tub, and the TV channel selection was decent. The room was clean and well cared for. The hotel was very nice, had some character, and was close to most of what people want to see when visiting New Orleans. However, it was a few blocks from most of those attractions, which I didnt mind, but someone who wants to be in the thick of the action might find it disappointing being in the business district where the hotel is. The walk to the waterfront or Bourbon Street was about 6 blocks and felt safe even at night. The free food and drink was a big plus. The breakfast offerings met all my expectations. Well-cooked scrambled eggs, waffles, bagels, etc. The afternoon happy hour selection was weaker. The hot dogs were consistently under cooked and somewhat unattractive in appearance. I would say beef was either non-existent or way down on the ingredients listing. The other foods were satisfactory, but nothing off the charts. Hey, but this was all free, so I cant subtract points. But if you plan on feasting your physician will take exception with your meal choices. In a general sense, based on observations at various times during my midweek visit, this hotel tends to attract a somewhat older crowd.say vacationing retirees. I only saw 1 child during my 3 day visit and limited people in their 40s or less. My only real issue with the hotel was the fitness center. It literally consisted of 2 treadmills and a bike. Nothing else. If a hotel advertises offering such an amenity, I dont think such a limited offering qualifies. While there was a sign up suggesting an improved offering will be forthcoming when the new hotel wing is complete, that didnt help me on my visit and I only consider hotels that offer such because I plan on using them. I wasnt able to here.All in all, I was satisfied with my stay despite the fitness center misrepresentation. I would not hesitate to select the Drury on a future stay.",Good
"When my husband and I needed to come to Dallas for surgery for a rare spinal condition, we decided to stay at a Residence Inn. My problem had begun right after we sold our home and we had been staying in a wonderful Residence Inn in Holtsville NY for over 3 months and loved it! They even helped arrange our stay here in Dallas. We have not been disappointed! The staff is helpful and friendly beyond words! The first room they gave us, as we had asked for a top floor in a quiet corner, had bar stool seating, which in my condition, was a problem. I thought I'd be eating on a computer desk for our month's stay! But as soon as my husband just mentioned it at the desk, we were allowed to see a handicap accessible room which turned out to be perfect. The room is clean and user friendly. It has a small kitchen with a microwave and 2 burners and supplies. There are lots of amenities. It is very comfortable. There are lovely complimentary breakfasts each morning with a wonderful variety as well as complimentary dinners 4 nights a week! The dining area is bright and cheerful. There is a lovely sitting area with a couch and armchairs and fireplace. The property is well kept with a beautiful pool area with a hot whirlpool and barbecue. The location is wonderful and once we learned the area, we found we are close to all sorts of stores and markets as well as Target, Walmart and Whole Foods. However you need a car to reach them. There is free Internet access and a downstairs computer if you do not have your own. There is also an exercise room that I regretfully can not take advantage of! However the most wonderful feature here is the staff...everyone of them! We will never be able to thank them enough for their kindness and helpfulness, whether it is with recommendations, directions or just being plain friendly. My husband and I have become big fans of Residence Inn! Both my children came to visit as well and loved it!Dear Guest,We are truly blessed to have you as part of our Residence Inn family. We are so pleased that your surgery went well and we hope you are continuing to improve every day!We hope to see you and your wonderful family in the future. Take care.",Good

"Everything about this newer hotel was pretty nice. Two big detriments: 14 to park, which is ridiculous for a Hampton Inn. Really!! And the bathroom doors have automatic closers, which is terribly annoying, especially when you have little children with you. When I commented to the front desk clerk on checkout what a hassle this was, she said, Yeah. I know. It's a problem we're trying to work on, but with 182 rooms, it takes a lot to do all of them. I said, Well, you should at least provide a doorstop in the room. Her reply was, Oh, you could have asked for one. We have them here. Well, why on earth isn't there a notice to that effect in the room We could have avoided a lot of misery. Anyway, the staff was very nice. The breakfast was very good. We didn't have an opportunity to use the outdoor/pool area, but it looked very inviting with a nice lounge/conversation area. We'd probably stay here again, but we'd definitely ask for a doorstop if they haven't fixed the doors yet. (And we might try to strike a deal with the restaurant next door to park for less.)Dear Traveler, Thank you for reviewing our hotel. The comments are insightful and helpful for the hotel teams goals to improve the service and guest experience. Please accept our teams sincere apology for the failures in service that resulted in any inconvenience and lack of comfort. We are grateful for the choice you made to be a guest of the hotel.

"Reward points stay for a weekend getaway for me and my wife. We usually stay at the Gaslamp Marriott, but we were looking for a change of scenery. A little confusing with the Springhill and Residence Inn being in the same building, but, nothing to difficult to figure out. Check in was a breeze, and Vanessa was extremely helpful and friendly. As a Platinum premier member I was offered the standard choice of a market item or points. I chose points as I always do. About 1/2 hour after check in a bottle of wine and 2 glasses showed up at my room compliments of Vanessa. What a great surprise! Rooms were clean and modern, if not a little small from an older Springhill suites. The only issue we really had was with the breakfast buffet. I know it is complimentary, but, the eggs and sausage were pretty much inedible. Other then that, I would recommend this location anyone looking for a hotel in a great location between the water front and Little Italy.",Good
We had my sisters baby shower in their air conditioned outside tent and it was so nice. It was the perfect size for 30-50 people and it was nice and cool and the lights were very charming. We were treated so nice from the staff and they were very accommodating. Thank you for a nice day!,Good
"We stayed for seven nights total, broken up by trips out to Mt Rainier and the peninsula, and we were happy to return to Springhill Suites. This hotel looks like a city block with no curb appeal but don't be dissuaded--all the charms start with the valets and continue inside! The sleek lobby with fireplace is spacious and provides several areas for conversation and an adjacent lobby bar is a busy spot to watch a game on TV or get a bite to eat. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful especially when we wanted to mail packages home. The efficient valets were on the ball every minute to store/retrieve your car (22.00/night), flag a cab, or arrange a shuttle to the downtown areas. Luggage carts are available at the point of entry. The engineer of the hotel offered to fix our luggage handle which was broken by the airline and it was done in minutes, cheerfully! The rooms are very spacious, the desk is roomy and has a good work light and even the desk chair was comfortable on rolling castors. Earth tones of grey and soft green walls were subdued and restful. Comfortable bed, above average linens and lots of great pillows. Sitting area had two floor lamps and was very ample with a nice firm sofa and two chairs. Everything was clean and updated, spotless sink area and toilet/bath room. Despite its location near the interstate our room was quiet. The daily breakfasts in the dining room were a full-service hot buffet for an additional nominal fee, efficient, welcoming staff, and no waiting. The Springhill Suites staff seems genuinely happy to serve patrons and we are appreciative for their helpfulness and suggestions, making this hotel feel like a home away from home.Reviews like this absolutely make my day -- there's nothing better than to hear we could be a bright spot and a comfort while someone was on the road.

"Our family of 4 stayed here overnight before our cruise. Hotel: from the exterior and lobby, the hotel looks nice. Rooms: a bit small, our room had a mini fridge. The room and bathroom are a bit outdated. The bathroom was also not as clean as the other hilton's I've stayed at. Rate: we were a hilton gold and received free breakfast so for what we paid then it was ok. Breakfast: buffet breakfast was really good. There is also a omlette bar and juice bar. The hotel was average. We don't normally stay by the airport when we visit Orlando. I felt the rooms were outdated but if you're only staying for a night and you get a good rate then it's ok.

"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel for four days during September 2012. A home away from home! Service and customer focused staff in all areas of the hotel looked after customers with genuine care. Every evening from 5.30pm they have the Manager's reception, which entails a free drink of your choice and extensive snacks. both hot and cold food. The breakfast is very adequate (cereals. eggs. waffles, juices, toast etc) .. and there are number of dishes. Perhaps some cut up fruit would have been good but there was bananas and apples available. There is coffee, juice, soda. Iced water available any time of the day in the reception area.The pool on the rooftop is excellent with strangely enough few guests using it....which suited us very well. always sparkling clean and fresh towels available. The small gym got a little hot and stuffy after 8am as the sun streamed in through a number of windows. We walked an easy walk to the riverfront where you can catch the street car. There usually is a street car operating outside the hotel but maintenance work was in progress when we stayed and only buses were available. The hotel has just commenced the building of a new wing and originally was due for completion in June 2013 but now completion is expected December 2013. We stayed in room 821 and had a small balcony overlooking the early stages of the construction sight. Didn't experience any inconvenience or noise. In fact had a lovely view at night as there was nothing obstructing our view, but this will change as the new hotel wing progresses. You will be fine for several months until this occurs. There is a small fridge and microwave in the cupboard which is adequate but go down to Frenchmen's Street for some great cafes and restaurants. Go to Coups Place for great Cajun food and cheap too! There is no doorman opening and closing doors. but who cares with all the other advantages one has in staying in this delightful hotel. So nice to know that management staff care about you and your stay at their hotel! Would recommend this hotel without any concern. When you book in 2013 to stay just first ask about the construction progress so you can enjoy your stay free of any inconvenience.",Good

"Booked one night on priceline since my usual hotels were full and didn't feel like using Hilton points. Will never make that mistake again. Pulled into hotel lot on a Saturday night about 10:00 p.m. Lot was COMPLETELY full even at that fairly early hour, lot spaces are very inadequate to the number of rooms. Finally managed to find a place after circling four times. Just as I was only pulling my bags out, three cars in the lot, all vehicles carrying gangbanger types drove by (looking to park at the hotel, not leaving), looking at me and scoping out my car. Similar type patrons in the lobby and around the exterior corridors of the hotel. I am not shy about travel, I have walked and worked in rough downtown areas, but I do expect to feel at least a modicum of safety for my person and belongings/vehicle. As I was walking to the lobby, two police cruisers came into the lot, one to circle, the other to park for awhile. At that point, I had it -- I informed the management that I would rather waste my priceline bid and go stay somewhere else, which I did. I am very disappointed that a Best Western would allow this activity on its property. The police did not seem to act like this was an isolated incident, but rather one of their regular patrols. I do not leave a negative review unless I feel it really warrants it, and this one wins first prize for me. I will never book this property again, let alone stay here. It is unsafe-feeling, and I would never take a family here.On behalf of myself and the entire staff here at the Best Western Inn Miramar, we are saddened to hear that a guest was displeased with his recent experience at the hotel. We pride ourselves on excellent guest service, beautiful and comfortable accommodations, and a safe and pleasant experience. The location of this hotel is in close proximity to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and is a very safe location. One of our most respected accounts is one that is with a Marine Division on this base. During the evening this guest checked in with us we had a large group of this Marine Division staying with us. We feel privileged to have the Marine Division stay at the Best Western Inn Miramar. They are the very men and women who protect our country and we are honored to have them at the hotel. They are often times not in military uniform during their stay at the hotel but are by no means gangbangers. They are polite, quiet, and very respectable guests. We have a very close relationship with their command and have never had any problems with them in the many years they have used us as their preferred hotel. To ensure the safety of all of our guests we have area officers occasionally do courtesy visits to the hotel as they do other hotels in the surrounding area. The Best Western Inn Miramar is in a very safe area and is located in a county with a dedicated and very courteous police force. There was no activity going on at the hotel and we thank the police for being kind enough to check up on us once in awhile, stop in for a cup of coffee and say hello. We appreciate their service.We are sorry that the guests experienced anything but absolute satisfaction during his visit as it is our goal to provide nothing but the best for each and every one of our guests whether they are business men, military soldiers, sports teams, or family vacationers. Each and every guest is important to us!Manu PatelGeneral Manager",Bad
"This was my first stay at this Seattle SpingHill Suites and it was amazing from the moment I arrived. The staff was friendly and eager to help me find my way around the city and get to and from the Seattle Convention Center for my convention including their free hourly shuttle to various sites. The morning breakfast buffet offered plenty of popular hot food choices and there is also plenty of sitting areas for just sitting back and relaxing with your morning cup of Java or tea. Having the self service laundry on-site was a real time and money saver! The hotel even provides dryer laundry sheets for you if requested. The restaurant and bar were worth staying on property for, well at least for some of your nights. Obviously you want to explore as much of Seattle dining and wining as you can while in the city.

"We saw the review of The Pearl in Sunset Magazine and thought it would be a great place to stay in San Diego. We stayed at The Grant last visit and loved it, but wanted a different local and experience. We were very happy with our choice. The atmosphere is fun and the dcor makes you feel like you are on a beach weekend from the 60's. Sparkling clean and comfortable. Excellent front desk personnel...the women could not have been more friendly, welcoming always with a smile. They know everything from the local restaurants and even directions to the stadium. (I asked for their names, but misplaced the card.) We stayed 11/21, 22. 23 and celebrated our anniversary with a drink on the house.It is 10 a night to park on the property which worked for us. Everything is centered around the pool. You can hear the bar restaurant noise, but everything gets quiet around 11:00. We liked hearing the laughter and vitality. Give it a try. We now Love The Pearl...thanks for the pins.On behalf of the entire Pearl crew management team, THANK YOU for your fantastic review. First off, Happy Anniversary! We truly appreciate you and are honored that you chose to stay with us. The vitality you felt is so true - a combination of great guests like yourselves and an awesome staff. We'll pass along your kind words to the front desk team. Please come again and tell a friend. Make it an amazing day!",Good
We recently stayed at the Chablis Inn. It was very affordable and clean! Everything we needed for a comfortable night stay. We left some valuables behind and didn't realize it until a week later when we were already home. We called and asked the staff to check the room we were staying in. She checked our room that we stayed in and called us back immediately that she had found our valuable. True honesty! It meant a lot to us and I would highly recommend the Chablis Inn if your planning to stay in Napa!,Good
"The Allstate Inn located in historic Seymour Indiana (Home to John Couger Mellancamp) is a two star establishment independently owned and operated, right off of I-65 and right next to a Waffle House.

"From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone was friendly and helpful. The property (especially the lobby area) is reflective of scene out of a classic 40's/50's movie...really cool! You enter through the street level, but you take the stairs or elevator up to the first floor where the lobby, check-in desk, bar and restaurants are located. There are 3 elevators, pretty busy during the 'rush' like check-in and check-out times, but most of the time we never had to wait too long to get into one. It helped that our room was on the 4th floor. Our room was nice, but anticipate it to be a little smaller than most, particularly the bathroom. This wasn't an issue for my husband and I, but had we brought our kid it'd have been tight. Bed was comfortable, and most of the usual amenities that you'd expect are available in the room. We LOVE the bath products...smelled marvelous! Had to request for a few more so we could take them back to Dallas with us, lol! Our room was located close to the elevator and in front of the ice machine room, but surprisingly we were never bothered by noise (and I'm a light sleeper). The rooms seemed sound-proof because we hardly heard the outside traffic noise or even from the loop train nearby. Also have to note that this hotel's location is on point. It is located in the financial/business area so keep in mind that most restaurants have limited hours during weekdays and are closed on the weekends. But we practically walked everywhere--fairly short distances to both Millennium Park area and the Magnificent Mile where you can find everything else. Also, we took the Blue line directly from O'Hare airport, and the Clark/Lake station where you'd get off is a short walk couple of blocks away from the hotel. So convenient!!Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay. We love Chicago, and hope to return to this hotel to stay due to the lovely service we've received and how greatly located it is to everything. Wouldn't have done it any other way.Friendly and comfortable is what we aim for and we're so proud of our team! The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Come back soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager",Good
"Our stay was great and for 84 a night(AAA rate) it was even better. The beds were comfortable, rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly. One thing that will mention, if you're expecting the room to be dark so you can get a good night's sleep, you might want to try somewhere else. The blackout curtains don't close the entire way, so instead they have some kind of plastic shade that you pull down that does nothing. A little bit after 6am it was extremely bright in the room so we were unable to sleep. Oh and the barn door for the bathroom is really noisy in the middle night so if you have an infant/toddler, go somewhere else. This hotel is close to Publix, right off the I-4 exit, you can walk to Bonefish Grill 7-Eleven and they have a free shuttle that takes you to Seaworld and Pointe Orlando.",Good

"First the bad - you get what you pay for, the building old and the lifts are rickety - one of those lifts where your not sure if you will make it up to your floor or not! The safe isn't electronic so you need to go to the reception pay 5 and get a key. Slightly worryingly the receptionist told me they only have a certain number of keys for the safes. As mentioned the streets close by are full of homeless, drunks and junkies. That said, there isn't too much the hotel can do about that.The rooms are not too bad, enough space and have a walk-in wardrobe to hang your clobber. Despite my earlier comments the hotel is central enough to get around the main attractions in a short taxi journey. A good place to stay if you aren't planning on spending much time in the hotel.Thank you for taking the time to provide a review of your stay. We are glad that you enjoyed our central location, and found our hotel so convenient for exploring the city. We are sorry that there were some elements of your stay which you did not enjoy. Please rest assured that although our lift is old, it is quite safe. We are sorry that you felt some areas of the hotel need updating but we do appreciate your feedback on this and will take your comments into consideration. Best wishes, Hotel Management",Neutral

"We had a long layover in San Francisco and chose to stay in Union Square. The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF. However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment. It is definitely geared toward the business traveler.Dear Globaltattler,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your most recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We apologize that you experienced increased traffic over the Pride weekend, and that our Butler service did not meet your expectations. Here at the St. Regis San Francisco we truly strive to surprise and delight all of our guests, and we are always grateful for any feedback that will allow us to do that better.Please do reach out to me personally should your travels bring you back to San Francisco.Warm Regards,Andre BroseHotel Manager",Good
"Set 2 mins walk from Union Square, this hotel is central to everywhere... parking can be a little difficult however we found an easily accessible garage just around the corner for approx 30 for 24hrs. The staff were friendly, the hotel was clean and well maintained, the rooms were of a good size and the pillows were gorgeously plush!! Very comfortable!",Good
"We have stayed at the Estancia several times we always have a good time enjoy the ambiance of the property. This time, weekend before Christmas was exceptionally quiet we took advantage of that because we've been there w/ one or two weddings or a jazz concert on their large main courtyard it gets very busy, crowded noisy!The grounds are very pretty, the large pool area very inviting heated! w/ a decent sized spa adjacent plus facilities. The resort sits on 9 plus acres, so you can manage to find manicured nooks, some w/ fireplaces to enjoy that quiet time. . Adjacent to the resort on a nice walk is the Salk Institute next to that the Gliderport. Something to see if u enjoy watching gliders along the beautiful coastline! Keep in mind this resort is not in the busy w/ tight parking La Jolla downtown area, its more of a relax get away stay put kinda place at least for us:)If you want right on the coast but in downtown La Jolla I would also consider the Pantai Inn.The rooms we have had are the standard w/ King although not very large they are comfortable well decorated. Small fridge available (used to be the locked booze bar). The bathrooms are also spacious w/ tub shower all amenities. There is a security safe for your valuables good coffee tea by a nook in the entryway available. On this outing we had a balcony but it only had room for one seat to enjoy the smaller court yard below.The But comes with our experience w/ Mustangs Burros their restaurant/bar w/ a beautiful large stone/brick fireplace seating area. Since TripAdvisor doesn't want reviewers to talk about restaurants on the Hotel review portion I will cover that on my separate review.Suffice it to say one gripe that ties in to the Resort policy is that we called to make reservations asked if we can bring our wine bottle provided by the resort (included in your resort fee).The answer was of course, yet when we got there the first thing the hostess said was you cant drink your bottle here! It went south from there:(The staff did a good job to be polite attentive I expected that on a very slow weekend.Be aware that there is a separate Valet only parking fee besides the Resort fee, but expectthat all along the CA coast resorts. In light of our issue w/ the MB restaurant/bar I would recommend visiting the Estancia, and I hope they review/revise their policy on that!Its such a pleasure to read such a positive review from a recurring quest! We are so happy that you enjoyed the resorts ambience, pool area, and most importantly the service. We are so appreciative that we have the opportunity to apologize for the miscommunication at Mustangs Burros and will be certain to look into the matter to prevent a mix-up such as this from happening in the future. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We hope we are able to welcome you back again soon!",Good
This hotel is great!!!! The staff are friendly and helpful. Great cocktail hour and a pretty good breakfast. The rooms are nice and a good size. Great parking rate! You get some great extras with your stay which is nice. The hotel is next to a trolley car stop which is nice. FYI if you have never been to the city buy an all day pass for the trolley. Its 3 per person for all day on and off stops. best deal around. It includes the buses in that pass as well. I have only two minor complaints and one is that the food during cocktail hour did not have healthy options for those that are watching their diet. The other was that we were next to the housekeeping closet and they were kindof loud early in the morning. Overall great experience and will book this hotel again!!!!,Good

"First, after reading previous reviews, I was prepared for a small quaint room. We had a King patio and it was quite large. It had 2 areas with a second TV, sofa and coffee table besides the comfortable bedroom area. Yes, the bathroom was small, but larger than a lot of the baths in other Historical hotels we've visited. The lush patio was really sweet and the courtyard around the pool reminiscent of European boutique hotels. The included breakfast is strictly coffee and pastries, but be sure to bypass the bagels for the croissants and sweet breads. The balcony rooms looked charming and faced the courtyard. In all, a great experience.Hello,We sincerely appreciate your positive feedback regarding your time joining us in March. We'd love to have you back for another luxurious stay at Bienville House!Sincerely,Bienville House",Good
"I was here for a business conference. While the conference was held at the Sheraton, I always like to stay at Hilton properties. This was a great choice. The hotel, an older building remodeled into a Hampton Inn, was very nice. The staff were very helpful and courteous. The rooms, though a bit small, were still very nice. They were clean and well maintained. The only way from inside the room you could tell you were in an older building were from the window sills. They were old. The mattresses were not quite was I am used to at other Hampton properties (not quite at plush), but the bedding was clean and nice. The tub/shower seemed a little older, but the bathroom overall was very clean and modern. I was on the 8th floor and had NO issues with outside noise. I found this to be a great stay.Dear Mike007D,Thank you for taking the time to post a great review about your recent stay here at the Hampton Inn Suites Atlanta Downtown.

"Recently had an enjoyable 3 night stay at the Westin. It is definitely a business meeting destination, but is well located in downtown San Diego. I do not recommend it for family vacations. The service from all was very good as were the meals. The rooms have different shapes, but are comfortable. The shower has a rain forest shower head plus a wand on a hose. The lighting in the bathroom is excellent. So if you are on a business trip you will enjoy.Dear Jim F,We are a great choice for business and leisure. Our location makes it easy to get to all of downtown San Diegos attractions. The Midway, Childrens Museum and the World Famous San Diego Zoo are only minutes from the hotel.

"Beautiful Hotel situated in a great location. Only 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street or tram right outside the door.Staff were all very courteous and helpful. Room was absolutely beautiful. King Size Bed in a huge room, big bathroom. Rooms were immaculate and very, very comfortable.Drury Inn serve free drinks and nibblies late afternoon. We enjoyed this at the end of our day.Our highlight of New Orleans was doing the Katrina Bus Tour. It was 3 hours very well spent and would recommend this to anyone visiting as staying in Downtown you wouldn't realise that anything had happened.",Good
"We have stayed in many of the downtown Seattle hotels from the hip to the old school and this is by far the best hotel - great service, airy and well appointed rooms - everything works like it should in this price range. We especially liked the location - you can walk everywhere and the neighborhood around this hotel feels safer than some other downtown areas... the hotel is especially convenient to the light rail network so an easy trio in from the airport and a short walk.Our only minor quibble (and this is minor in the big scheme of things, but an area Hyatt may want to look at) is charging a 1/bottle of drinking water - in a 300+/night hotel the water should be free and plentiful!",Good
"We just spent the weekend at The Pearl. The best thing about this place was the service. The entire staff was friendly and Our room was clean and basic, and our pet goldfish Betty was fun touch.We had drinks and small plates at Eat at The Pearl's happy hour when we initially arrived. The food was fine, and the drinks were good.The concept of The Pearl is great, but it is starting to look shabby, especially around the pool area. Also, it's obvious this place is a hangout for locals that are not staying in the hotel. It didn't seem like a vacation friendly pool for those staying, but more like a locals only party pool. Now I'm all for a fun party vibe, I've stayed at Ace hotels many times, but it did seem to us that local peeps took over the place, and because of that, we didn't feel like hanging out. This was a little disappointing, as our Strand room was not exactly inexpensive.Thank you for taking the time to leave a review and for all of your feedback! Since we pack a lot into our little gem, our restaurant and bar surround our pool, so when we have brunch guests (Hotel and local) join in the FUN! We apologize if you felt unwelcome in the pool, we would never want our guests to feel that way! Thanks again for your feedback and I'm happy to hear that our staff delivered on service.

The Negative: the mattress was extremely hard and uncomfortable, the bathroom sink didn't drain and overflowed while we were brushing our teeth, the bathroom light only worked when it felt like it, and the kicker was the complimentary breakfast was by far lacking. not allot of options for a BW Premier property and the items that were offered were either stale or expired, not to mention the breakfast room was so crowded we had to line up in the hall to get something to eat and bring it back to our room.

"I stayed at this motel from 7/11 - 7/16 2012 for Comic-Con. I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.",Good

"Arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Hotel Staff was nice upon greeting. Asked me to upgrade to a King with 2 bunk beds, but I kept the 2 double beds.The label of suite means an extra sitting room in the front with a sofa, small desk, TV, refrigerator, and microwave. The extra room made it nice for our little boy to play while we are resting in the bedroom.AC design is peculiar. Front room gets the main AC, then the room with beds is blocked by a glass sliding door. There is a fan which pulls the AC through to the bedroom. Bathroom was clean, but had a chemical smell. Carpet, wallpaper, and paint all look like they need remodel, which on the hotel website said was going to happen soon. Sliding door to bathroom does not have a lock. Nice to have 2 flat screen TVs. Bed was comfortable.We had a room in the back of the hotel, which made it quiet. The bathroom window faces a bunch of apartments, so you need to remember to close it for your privacy.Price was economical. I read the fine print about the 12 parking fee, I don't think is a big deal. However, they should create a line item in their billing before they quote the nightly price.Breakfast room was convenient and food was well stocked. I would consider going back to this hotel after the renovation. I hope they redo the AC system instead of relying on an old-fashioned fan to re-distribute the air.Dear Guest,We would like to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey.

We recently stayed at the Best Western Yacht Harbor Inn In San Diego. It is a great little hotel right down on the Harbor. The rooms could use a little updating . The bathrooms are starting to show their age. The staff was very nice. I asked to be moved to a harbor view room and they were very helpful in making that happen.The continental breakfast was really good. They had many wonderful choices of both hot and cold items.The yogurt parfaits and the pancake machine seemed to be very popular. Our room on the 5th floor had a spectacular view of the harbor. The hotel really does have a great location. It has a pool and hot tub. If you stay there take the time and go for a walk on the harbor. this property is located near the zoo and sea world. If you need to unload your luggage. Make sure and park out front and use the lobby doors. Otherwise you will be hauling your luggage up some stairs. The parking garage is located off the back of the lobby and you need to use the stairs.Thank you for sharing your experience with Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel. I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.,Good
I have never been to this hotel before and it was so great. The rooms were nice and the beds were very comfortable. We were pleasantly surprised and the staff was A+. Definitely going to go back and enjoy it again.Thank you for such a kind review! I would highly recommend signing up for our newsletter to receive news and specials for your next stay to Pacific Beach. We look forward to seeing you again.,Good
"I really enjoy Best Western Hotels and feel they are the best chain around. I appreciate the cleanliness of the rooms, friendliness and hard work of the staff and the heartiness of the breakfast. I recommend Best Western to anyone. I'm also grateful for the government rates and tax exemption forms for federal travel. Best Western Yacht Harbor is close to the bay and great dining opportunities. I will definitely stay there again.",Good

"Stayed in the Drury Inn and Suite for 2 nights over memorial day weekend and it was the best hotel i've stayed in for a long time. Our suite was huge with a large lounge, bathroom and huge floor to ceiling arced window which over looked the pool.The reception staff were always friendly and ready to help with suggestions of places to eat and really added a little extra to the stay. We were also allowed to check in at 11am without any additional cost which was really appreciated.The happy hour had a huge range and gave us the energy we needed after a day of walking NOLA's famous streets before heading out for dinner. Breakfast was also very good, with lots on offer and staff were always available to top up anything running empty.The location is great - with a street car stop right outside, altho we walked to and from the hotel to the french quartered repeatedly as it was a nice walk and only a few blocks.The rooftop pool and hot tub were perfect and always clean - the only problem was they only open them at 9am!Have only good things to say of this hotel - would book again in a second and would recommend to anyone visiting NOLA - it's a fantastic place!",Good

"Front Desk staff was very welcoming and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Parking area was well lit and safe. Breakfast was everything I needed to start my day. Stayed at this hotel previously and returned for a second time. Consistent both stays. Easy access and on and off the freeway.Dear Bill M, Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus San Diego/Miramar. We are thrilled to hear we are a clean comfortable hotel. We work hard in providing our guests with a well-maintained property and are touched you took notice. As you mentioned, we do offer complimentary breakfast and are delighted you were able to enjoy it during your stay. We look forward to your next night with us and appreciate your feedback regarding the Best Western Plus San Diego/Miramar.",Good
"The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself is a hit or miss.Upon arrival, the room was very small, crowded, outdated uncomfortable. Not what you would expect from a BW Plus hotel.We unpacked most of our stuff and went for dinner, only to come back to discover the bathroom had not been cleaned and there was urine and pubic hairs on the floor. I was extremely grossed out and could not use the bathroom.The TV box was also missing so we could not use the TV.I contacted the front desk girl and she was able to switch us to a different (and bigger) room that had been renovated, and was clean so that was a huge relief. She was able to do this even though it was close to midnight.The TV box was stolen from the new room as well (these must be popular in the USA...lol), but the great maintenance man was able to get one from another room and install it the next day for us.The hotel itself was very close to lots of activities, so the location is good, but if you want a nicer room, go with 2 queens or a king.",Neutral
Did an overnight from Tampa and wanted to finally try this place. Very nice views and the room was clean and big(we had a 1BR suite). Nice views of the bay also. Probably only downside is being a good distance from the beach and more of the restaurants but there are shuttles in the area. Overall we really liked it... More,Good
"Great location, close to where I need to go. Friendly staff, clean room! Got free upgrade to a suite. It will be very convenient for a family travel.

Hello huagiy,We are delighted to hear we were able to provide a complimentary upgrade to one of our suites and you were able to enjoy it! We strive for excellent service and cleanliness and it appears we hit the mark on your stay. Thanks for choosing to stay at Chicago River Hotel!",Good
This place was disgusting. The room smelled like molded carpet. The handle on the entry door was broken. The door jam on the entry door looked like it had bee recently kicked in. I'm not sure why this motel would be part of anything associated with Windom hotels. I would like a refund. The worst part is that it cost... More,Bad
"Our Agent booked us 5 nights at the Shoreline Waikiki at the end of February and it did not disappoint. Great boutique style hotel in very good location and lovely staff. Special mention to Josh and Venus who were so happy to help. Whilst the rooms (we had 721) are not luxurious they are very clean and comfortable with all the promised amenities including good Wifi. The complimentary grab and go muffins and health bars at breakfast were very convenient for early starts and very tasty. Infused waters and 24/7 coffee and tea in Reception also great. Used the roof top pool area on a couple of afternoons after sightseeing. Also borrowed the chairs from reception for the beach which is only a short walk away. For info there are self-service laundry facilities at the Coconut Waikiki, the sister hotel a short walk away, again very helpful reception if you need change for the wash machines. Breakfast wise we did use the Heavenly Restaurant next door which was very nice but also very busy. Most days we used the Dukes Lane Market Eatery around the corner on Kuhio Avenue which catered for all tastes. Certainly lived up to its good Trip reviews.",Good
"I stayed in this hotel for work the week of December 17th. The location is attached to Lennox Square mall so it was very convenient to get some last minute Christmas shopping in without having the hassle of driving to/from malls. The hotel is located across the street from Lennox MARTA station and couldn't be easier to get to from the Airport, however it's pretty much a car-kinda-town so unless you plan to be in one location . .I'd drive. The hotel itself was nice with good public rooms and the rooms themself were standard Marriott / Renaissance style. The bedding and bathrooms were good also -- always nice to have a freestanding shower in the bathroom. The only peeve I have really is to be charged for internet connection. In this day -- especially with lower category Marriott brands like Courtyard / Fairfield Inn / Residence Inn not only charging lower but offering free internet -- it's bothersome. Nearby and walkable are plenty of restaurants both inside the mall and along the perimeter so there's no want for eating. I didn't try the hotel restaurants as I'm Platinum and usually have breakfast in the lounge. The lounge itself was fine and served a variety of breakfast foods. The nighttime snacks were a bit scant -- but hey, it's free so can't complain on that!Lastly -- there is a Westin directly across the wide parking lot so if you need to stay in Buckhead and want to be walkable to the mall both will do just fine. JW Marriott though is the only of the two actually connected to the mall whereas the Westin is in the outside of the parking lot.",Good

"Pretty little lobby. We were kind of discouraged when we realized how far we would have to carry our bags on the winding upper floor, but it was worth it.Charming room which we fit 3 people in just fine. Window facing the river. Quiet except for street noise, but it was fun noise. Within walking distance of everything. Less expensive than most places.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your feedback.

"We had made a reservation for two couples on Sept 17 and had the confirmation thru Expedia/hotels.com. When we arrived...frazzled after being evacuated with my Boston sister and husband who were visiting us during this difficult time...we were told that they had no rooms due to some problem that occurs occasionally with this booking service!!! We were struggling for two hours to locate another hotel ..using both Expedia (who owed us big!) and our own efforts... and no one came thru. Just as we were going to give up, there was a shift change at Reception and our savior Lorenzo came on. Thru some magic, he was able to provide us with two lovely rooms for the night!! He is a truly charming and compassionate...an excellent employee and human being!!The rooms were nicely decorated with very comfortable beds. Old San Francisco feel! Would stay there again!Hi Alan, We were pleased to provide you with a safe refuge from the fires, and we are pleased to have provided you with suitable accommodation. If you are staying with us, or indeed any hotel, again, do consider booking directly with the hotel, and you will have much less likelihood of issues arising with your booking and with your check-in on future visits. We hope that you will visit us for a more pleasant reason in the future. Best wishes, Hotel Management",Good
"Frankly, I reserved this hotel because it was the cheapest decent property I could find in downtown Seattle. So I wasn't expecting much when we checked in. We were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are small and the building is old, but they've done a good job of making the best of it. I've seen it described as quaint and that's a fair description. It has the look and feel of an old classic place. It's clean and well-maintained, and they've done a good job of updating the necessary amenities. They also have a sister property across the street with which they share facilities (ie. laundry). It's nothing special, and yet it is. They have a good (albeit expensive) restaurant in the lobby, which means breakfast is pricey, but there's a decent place a block away called Corner Caf. The only thing I really missed is a fridge and microwave.Hello Traveler - Thank you for your review. We are please to hear that you were pleasantly surprised by your stay with us (we do that to our guests all the time!). We hope you'll stay with us again when your travels bring you back to the Emerald City!",Good
"When we fly into Orlando to visit family on the east coast we usually get in late and stay near the airport before driving over the next morning. My go to hotel is the Hilton Garden Inn MCO. The staff is very friendly, the service is always consistently good and the accommodations are clean and comfortable. Our most recent stays were during and then shortly after renovations and the new lobby looks modern and inviting.

"This was my first experience of a Hampton Inn. Check in was easy and efficient. Some of the staff were more easy going than others but overall they conducted themselves professionally and courteously. My room was a King studio. The bed was super comfortable for me. Space was adequate as a solo traveller attending a conference. The breakfast was good and varied over the 5 days I was there. Wifi was solid and quick. I had a car and was able to park underneath the hotel. Parking spaces were good. Parking was secured after 7pm. There is a local Taco Bell and petrol station nearby. There is a Vons and other shops down the road about 3 minutes. The views of the freeway was uninspiring but the noise was not intrusive. Overall, I had a good stay and if in the area again, I would be happy to stay here again.",Good

"We had spent 6 weeks travelling around America. This hotel was by far the worst and did not live up to the reviews. (So much so, that we suspected the owner's relatives had posted the positive reviews). The location wasn't as close to fisherman's wharf as was stated. True, it was in Lombard street but it was a 20 min walk to the wharf, and walking back uphill Forget it! It is only for the extremely fit.We bussed it there and back and that was ok but for my mind a little inconvenient. We had a room on the top floor, unfortunately their 2 person elevator stopped at the floor below so we had to lug 5 bags up and down flights of stairs- no fun. The room itself was horrendous. Decor was the fifties with chipped pieces out of the furniture, no room to store our luggage (except for an open alcove that wouldn't take our cases, a filthy bathroom that still had previous tenant's soaps and mess on top of the shower rail. Bathroom sinks were filthy. We were also attracted by the free contintental breakfast. What breakfast The lobby office was 10 feet by 10 feet with a small table with coffee and packets of danishes. You couldn't eat in there and in fact had to stand in line (Half outside the door) to grab a quick danish. Our overall impression Yuk! Spend the bucks and go closer to the wharf.",Bad
"I love old hotels when they have been impeccably preserved like this one. The rooms are comfortable, everything works in the marble bathrooms, the staff is helpful and friendly. The new owners seem to be trying to relax a little of the stuffiness without sacrificing the elegance, and they are doing a good job. The location on Pill Hill makes it convenient for doctor visits. Be sure to ask for their medical rate. The restaurant is good, but you can also go across the street to the Corner Cafe for breakfast or lunch, or down one block to the popular Vito's for dinner.This old dame is quite a charmer! I'm glad you appreciate all the work that has gone into keeping her as beautiful as the day she opened! Yes, we're definitely about being upscale, not uptight. Glad you felt that.

"Just stayed here Feb '12. Not a horrible place for the . I paid 85 for the room and it's right in downtown atlanta next to the marriot. Usually the location at lone would command 100 minimum per night. Parking was confusing. i don't like to pay for valet so I opted to park my car alone when I pulled up, and about 100ft down the street from the main entrance is a parking garage in the same bldg, so I parked there (15 a day). Upon walking to the desk to check in I was informed their parking garage is cheaper, but it's located caddy corner across the st to the hotel (weird). The desk clerk tried to convince me to go get my car from where it was parked and pull it into their garage - again, weird. I was put on the 9th floor (elevator is pretty shoddy - as soon as it stops at a floor the doors immediately open and shut to keep going, be careful). The room wasn't too bad. Decent size. Old tv, pretty visually unappealing. Bathroom was full of hairs, everywhere. Also there was a bucket under the sink to deal with a leaking pipe. I'm usually low maintenance and don't mind the occasional spot or hair, but this room just felt really dirty and gross. The bed was the worst part. Although it was a king, it was horribly uncomfortable. Worst back pain of my life in the morning. Fitness center is a joke. Although spacious, it has a treadmill and a bike, and a multi gym weight tower in the middle, that is in awful condition and all of the cables are broken. I didn't even bother working out there. Breakfast was modest. Literally ice cold pastries, watered down juices, do it yourself waffles, and reconstituted eggs. Breakfast starts at 6 and I got there at 6:30, and a kid that apparently worked there (no id/uniform) was scrambling to set everything up - I'm guessing he was late for work. Other people he was hanging out with and eating with (other employees or his friends) were also there chatting and having a good time. Very strange, I don't think they were guests, and I think it is inappropriate for the employees to be eating breakfast with guests.Again, for the price I'm really not complaining, you get what you pay for. Location isn't too bad either. Had I paid more of this was a more prestigious brand hotel, I'd be writing a letter to the CEO.shaunbsc,Thank you for your review. Since your stay, we have been actively working to improve our service level, responsiveness, and the functionality of our products to ensure things are operating as they should.

It is not the Luxury of other Mandarin Orientals but the price is different as well. The service was excellent and the concierge gave us excellent dining suggestions. Valet parking is very efficient and worth it. The hotel has a very good location for reaching other areas in Miami and we very much preferred down town that the noisy Miami beach. We did not dine in the hotel but the bar is excellent. There was life music and a very nice ambiance. The hotel was also much better when compared to other five stars ee stayed in Miami beach. The only minus is that they charged us 12 US a day for wifi ().,Good

"There were four couples of us meeting from several states to spend a few days in New Orleans...mainly to visit the WWII museum. We got a good rate on Hotel.com at the Bienville and decided to stay there. One thing that surprised us, was that they have quite a few rooms with no windows...and we all got one of these rooms. Other than that, everything at the hotel was good. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful...especially the husband and wife team that help with breakfast. (One warning here...there is not nearly enough seating to accommodate the number of rooms the hotel has if you get there any time after 8am.) The rooms are comfortable and very nicely furnished. The hotel itself is clean and beautifully decorated. The hotel is within walking distance of most everything...right off of the French Quarter. And...it is only a couple of blocks away from the bus or trolly stop if you are going further. The WWII museum is a little over a mile away (plan on spending the whole day there...it is amazing!!!). You can either walk or take the bus/trolly. One warning...parking is VERY expensive. With tax, it was 38 per day for our SUV.Overall...I would definitely stay there again!Hi BarDen, Thank you so much for the wonderful review!

"We got in late due to car trouble during our honeymoon road trip, and not only did Robert and the rest of the wonderful front desk staff save us a parking spot and greet us warmly, they upgraded us to a suite for our stay! The staff was nothing but exceptional the entire time, the room clean, comfortable and modern, and the breakfast the best I've ever had in a hotel. I would have liked a little more fresh fruit, but the market isn't far so that wasn't a huge deal. We actually added on another day and night because we were having such a wonderful time! It's location is perfect as well, just far enough away to be quiet but close enough that a short walk puts you right in the action of the French Quarter. The only drawback was that our car was hit in the parking lot, and we didn't notice until we had stopped on our way out, so perhaps next time we'll park elsewhere. One low point on an otherwise stellar experience!",Good

Lenox mall is next door with a covered walkway to it, wife LOVED that. Houston's restaurant across Lenox Rd was superb(see separate review). Room was quite nice and the bedding was fabulous. The negative was the AC was on 67, woke up hot, turned it down to 63, woke up in the am still hot and it wasn't one of those blistering days that you can experience in ATL. Otherwise the hotel was very good and modestly priced for ATL considering the quality.PS: The parking lot requires the room key to use to exit and there is a box to drop it in, if you have checked out. A strange set up and I wasn't informed about this when I checked out. Had to buzz the desk and get them to open the gate, which held up 4cars behind me wanting to leave.Thank you for your excellent comments and feedback. I am sorry that you were too warm in your guest room and had some challenges with your garage departure.

Just note that the beds we had were very firm. And the walls are very thin! You can hear your neighbors in the next room. I wear earplugs at any hotel/motel I stay at so this didn't bother me as much.

"The best part of this hotel is the location. It cannot be beat for that reason only I'd stay here again. Was greeted by a younger guy of Asian appearance in reception room wasn't ready but he guaranteed it would be bottom floor as needed, and there was a muck up with check out dates (del sol error) and he said it would be fixed up. I come back and not only did he not get a bottom floor room he didn't bother fixing the error either. Thankfully the new guy that served me did but don't bother tipping the other guy he won't do his job. Room itself was fine only problem was the noise. A toddler upstairs walking felt like Tyrannosaurus rex up there. Yes breakfast is average but I'm happy with cereal so I felt it was fine. I didn't like the fact the cleaners left your doors open for upto an hour whilst doing other rooms. I was in the pool and the ones near the pool were open. I'm glad I hide my expensive things in the safe. The Denny's in front isn't great food or service but I hop 2 doors down was great",Neutral
"Stayed here one night before a flight out of Sanford Airport - it looks big and pretty, but it's a huge pain to get in and out of this hotel.

"Was pleasantly surprised about the level of comfort I found at this place for this low price. Beautifully renovated property in great location. Bar/Lounge on the ground floor and courtyard are very inviting and give you a homey feeling. I loved the new design. Very well done transformation from drab Choice Hotel this used to be. Will sure come back! Staying in a newly renovated property so close from everything at this low price - can't beat that. Lastly, there's a great little Thai restaurant called Bahn Thai just one block away.",Good
"Last weekend I traveled to San Diego for a memorial service. From the time I made the reservation with Len Regan until I checked out early Monday morning, I was treated like a valued customer. Len upgraded me to a suite without any prompting on my part. He provided excellent, concise directions to public transportation as well as provided a coupon for a Trolley Tour of the city. The Lamplighter, while an older hotel, is very well maintained and super clean. It's third generation American family owned. The landscaping is lush, the breakfast is more than a continental and very tasty. The team spirit among the employees and staff was most noticeable. I observed an array of elderly folks who seem to be frequent guests and discovered many have been coming for two to three month stays for many years. There are good restaurants within walking distance. All in all, I would highly recommend this Best Western.",Good
"Stayed here for a week on a business trip, so got to know the hotel well. Very comfortable, well appointed with all you'd need (and expect) from a Grand Hyatt hotel. Convenient location in centre of downtown, close walking distance to office district, shopping, great selection of restaurants and 20 min walk from wonderful Pike Place Market. In-hotel restaurant is top end qualify, if slightly pricey, but good for breakfast. Service throughout the hotel is excellent, especially the guys out front who call you cabs.Tip for alternative breakfast option go to deli shop linked next door for great sausage muffins/ bagels coffee - delicious and served by lovely people.In summary, a great hotel from which to enjoy the city of Seattle!Thanks for your comments! It's wonderful that you felt happy and accommodated during your slightly longer stay our main goal is always to make sure that our guests feel valued and accommodated.

"It's a Marriott so you know the quality will be good. Attended a conference there in the fall so couldn't enjoy the courtyard pool as the weather was too cold. Kept too busy to really get the know the hotel but the standards you'd expect were there.Great breakfast buffet - but then again you pay big dullas for it... no different than any other 4 - 5 star. If you don't like planes, then stay away. The hotel is right under the final approach to one of O'Hare's runways. As one of the busiest airports worldwide, there's a big one on it's way down every few minutes. I sat on my balcony trying to have a conversation with a colleague eventually gave up went inside - the noise from the planes was just insane. The upside though is that you get a unique view of the belly of aircraft at low altitude. Interesting, even for that experience.Dear Swazimac - Thank you for taking the time to post a note regarding your recent stay at our hotel. We are delighted to hear that our recent 40 million investment of the hotel is being noticed as the hotel is a landmark in the area. Thank you also for the compliments in regards to food preparations. I am delighted to hear you enjoyed the breakfast buffet! But Im sorry to hear that your past stay was impacted by noise from air traffic. Unfortunately there is the occasional day when extreme weather conditions dictate that planes land at lower altitudes and I believe this may have had a big impact with regard to your stay. However, thermal pane windows in all of our guestrooms reduce noise factors. Should you find your travels back in Chicago and wish to stay with us again, please ask to be placed on a lower floor inside room. And fortunately, we are almost through the most severe rains Chicago has experienced in more than 50 years! Safe travels,",Good
"How lovely to finally find our hotel and discover the sign reads the NARCH HOTEL!, thankfully it didnt live up to its accidently given name! The reception staff were polite, if a little unapproachable, we had to discover all the facilities of the hotel by roaming around....only after 5 daysof braving the homeless people to use the phone in the street, did we discover the payphone and vending machines. They could really use a map of the hotel, or at least show you the facillities on arrival. Our room was comfy and clean, the bed was a brilliant size and so nice to crawl into after scaling the hills all day!! The maid service was excellent. The down sides were apparent straight away, our room was facing the corner of a busy junction, on the 6th floor....the constant traffic woke us up frequently as did the fire trucks which used their sirens freely and at least twice in the night, every night!!!!! The area is dodgy looking but actually not as bad as we anticipated, true there are homeless people everywhere and the street cleaners dont seem to venture that far, but we never had any trouble ( in fact i encountered more scary situations in the lift with non english speaking leery men who find it 'funny' to wedge you into a corner...) most homeless people were friendly or kept to themselves. Take a right as you come out the hotel, and you'll find a fantastic sandwhich shop QUIZNOS, right again and a cinema,diner and cocktail bar which are all really nice yet not mentioned in our guide. Lovely trip overall!!!",Good

We hope to have the honor of welcoming you back soon!",Good
It is close to the major attraction Seattle has to offer. If you enjoy walking the public market and the first Starbucks is close enough for a walk as well. The hotel is green and it very much reflects that the institution is responsible in terms of doing its part to protect our environment.

"This was my first trip to San Francisco, and this hotel was one of the cheaper ones I could find. What a surprise it was, probably the most high end hotel I've been to. Nim and Phil were amazing people to talk to and were very helpful in telling me how to get around the town. The room was amazing and the bed was better than the one I have at home. It's about 80ft from the entrance to China town and very close to union square. I couldn't imagine picking a better place to stay in San Francisco.Thank you very much for your comments. We are glad that you found us to exceed all of your expectations. Nim and Phil are great team members and you were in great hands with them during your stay. I am sure you will agree, but many of our guests comment about our beds and their comfort. Please make sure to visit us on your next trip to San Francisco.Best,Bruce PFront Office Manager",Good
"great comfy hotel, nice outdoor pool, friendly staff and amazing breakfast buffet. Only complaints are the lack of vegetarian dishes on the main menu and the only main course they have is inedible, and the pool would be better if there was a bar or coffee shop next to it where we could sunbathe and order a drink or a snack. apart from that my stay was epic and staff are so helpful!",Good

"I would recommend this hotel only for the young or quite thrifty or you just need a place to crash for the night. In that case, it is perfect and is inexpensive for a Queen room and the quads are even less expensive. A perfect place to stay cheaply for a music festival or weekend out on the town. Overall, I would not recommend staying here if you want to spend a lot of time in your room. Any time other than sleeping really. Although it is clean it is miniscule. We stayed in a Queen Room and the bed took up nearly the entire room. In fact you can only get in and out of one side of the bed as the bed is literally built into the wall and only one side is open so if you are sharing the bed be prepared to be disturbed or to wake up your partner when you need to get up during the night. I wasn't thrilled but that is my fault because I did not do my research. To be honest this hotel is really just a step up from a hostel. They have quad dorm rooms that are shared and either coed or female only. If I had seen that it probably would have deterred me from booking however our stay went well. The vibe was young, casual and welcoming and everything was spotless, clean and well cared for.My first impression of the hotel was a feeling of happiness to be off the street, it was cold and sleeting out, but the lobby was warm and cozy. I began to worry fairly quickly however, the desk clerk that checked us in obviously did not love his job. We chuckled to ourselves as we were greeted with a strong whiff of pot smoke as we waited for him to find our reservation. The good news is, the other clerk, a woman quickly began helping the next guests to arrive. Not only was it obvious that she liked her job, she was cheerful and efficient and she gave them pointers and information that our clerk didn't. Our clerk was virtually silent and that meant we were able to hear the other clerk's great tips about the hotel bar, restaurant and free wiFi. We were checked in and up to our room on the 11th floor in no time eager to get back down to the bar and have a drink. However, when I opened the door to our room I almost stepped back to head back down to the desk. It's my fault however, I had read that the rooms were small I just did not realize how small. This was the smallest room that I have ever stayed in. The room was literally only a couple of feet deeper than a queen sized bed which is 80 inches long. There is no closet only a tall locker that is built into the room and gives you room for the two robes and mini ironing board and not much more. There is a TV mounted above the foot end of the bed which was almost too close to watch for me, we left it off during our stay. There is a desk immediately across the room near the one small window and a small bathroom with a tiny shower and sink (very little counter space for anything. I had to put my curling iron on the toilet so it wouldn't fall from the tiny shelf that angled down towards the floor). The bathroom did have a nice feature however, a heater that you could turn on that quickly warmed the tiles up to make the bathroom nice and toasty when you got out of the shower. We checked out the bar but it was full. No where to sit and relax comfortably so we went next door to the Acme Hotel and had a drink in the bar there. The next morning we checked out and we were happy that we tried out the caf. The coffee was hand pressed and delicious and the croissant I had was fresh, flaky and so yummy.Hi Jacqueline, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am sorry to hear that the room size was disappointing during your visit. While our rooms are cozy in size, we try to make sure that is clear when describing to allow our potential guests to make the best choice to meet their needs. Although the rooms are cozy, we do have different lay outs where the bed is not built in the wall. We also encourage our guests to enjoy our large den space and guest kitchen as an alternative to being in your guest room. The Broken Shaker is amazing, so I am sorry you were not able to experience our cocktails as we were too full. I hope next time you are in town you can stop in and enjoy the Broken Shaker! If you would like to discuss your stay further please reach out to us at anytime. We hope to have you back in the future.Thank you,Jenna",Neutral
"This was my second five-night stay for business. My room this time was a tad bigger with more shelving in the bathroom to accommodate my toiletries. This was a HUGE plus. Traveling in the middle of winter, the rates are phenomenal for this beautiful hotel and loop location! I'm able to easily walk to and from place of business each day. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The accommodations are above average in every way. The bed is extremely comfortable with high quality sheets. My housekeeper was excellent (absolutely the best I've had) ANTICIPATING my needs. How often does that happenWhat a wonderful review!

We arrived in the mid afternoon at the motel without resrvation. It was Saturday and that did not help the situation. Young lady at the reception desk told us that there was no vacancy for non-smoking room. We did not have a choice so we took a smoking room. What a surprise. The room did not smell at all.,Good
"My son and came to Atlanta for our annual trip to see the Braves. We stayed at the JW a few years ago. Although the hotel was nice, the experience was just ok. The room was nice but had the old style TV. Room service was slow, staff ok. The only thing that was great was being next door to the Lenox Mall. Last year we stayed at at the Omni but decided this year to give the JW another try. I'm so glad I did. It was a completly different experience from our previous stay. The staff was genuinely helpful and concerned. After checking in (10am) I left the front desk thinking I remembered where to go to get to the room. I saw a security person and asked her. She was so helpful. She went on the elevator with us, took us to our room,made sure our keys worked and if the room met our standards. I have never received service like this. The security person's name is Gwen Rankin. She gave us her card and told us if we need anything to contact her. The room was very nice and had the flat screen TV that we come to expect from a high class hotel. My son and I had plans the next day and wanted room service. We thought we had to get up at 6am to place our order so that could get to our destiation on time. Well we woke up late and was going to change our plans. I called room service and they told me they will be there in 30 mins or less. I was pleasantly surprised. Our previous experience with room service, it took them almost 2 hrs to bring our food. Needless to say my son and I were able to keep our plans. After this trip it was decided that if I'm able to get the great Government rate as I did this trip, the JW will be our hotel whenever we visit Atlanta.",Good

"Great hotel, wonderful hospitality, staff funny and very helpful. Rooms nice and clean. Beds comfortable. We were in a suite, the living room was comfy, ample workspace for two people. We were there the week before Mardi Gras on a business trip. Check in evening, our toilet overflows, we use all the towels in the bathroom to mop after we disable the float. Call to front desk. Immediate response. Front desk guy has a plunger and a plastic bag, comes in an plunges the toilet. Clears the paper. Says he's not supposed to plunge toilets. Leaves us with wet towels (and used toilet water) behind the toilet. Fortunately, the room is not level, so all the water stays mostly behind the toilet. Housekeeping gone, so fortunately, we still had two clean towels for a.m. and the detritus is not near our feet. Next day, some towels replaced, and housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom and skimpy on towels. Second day, housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom. Third day I notice that a little piece of plastic wrapping that I had binding some brochures in my suitcase was still laying on the floor in the bedroom. Shower has not great water pressure but is nice and roomy too. Hair dryer was awful. One day we were still in the room when housekeeping came, and when we came back in the early evening our room was not done. A call to front desk and our room was cleaned (with the leftover spray bottle in the bathroom) by time we got back from dinner.So, it's clean but some staff are a little forgetful. I was not bothered by the issues, it's a quirky little hotel. With a quirky staff...very laid back and quite fun!What did bother me, though, was one day I went down for breakfast. A youth bus group had been there the night before and they devestated the free breakfast bar. By 7:30 a.m. (the breakfast is open until 9 or so), most of the hot food was gone, and the server said they were done for the day. Huh Otherwise, the breakfast bar was nice, all the usual stuff. The evening reception was really nice. The hotel is close to convention center, French Quarter, and all the fun places.Overall, I'd stay there again, I'm hoping that the housekeeping issues were quirks and next time I'm bringing my own hair dryer. It did have free internet in the rooms, a huge plus.",Good
"Room service was an added cost - never saw that before. Changes actual room rate, from what was advertised - deceptive. Shower controls not secured to wall. Toilet see not tightened down. One light had to be unplugged to turn off, because switch was missing. In general, facility maintenance appears to be absent.",Bad
"You will find the friendliest people in the business in the lobby of this hotel. They made my stay so wonderful and helped me, my husband and my 1yo daughter out with something everyday. Walk out your room and take 5 steps to the beach, quaint beachside restaurants, coffee shops, AMAZING TACOS, etc. I have stayed here twice now, and I think I will be booking every time my family visits San Diego. I am giving the Pacific View Inn a good review so they can get plenty of business and always be there, but I kinda don't want to so they're not booked up next time I try to get a room. Wow! Kind words from great guests. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience Sarah.

"This will be the third time we have stayed at this hotel. It is a very nice hotel with all the ammenities you would need but not all you might find in a five star hotel. But , considering the location to the airport, Amtrak Location, and Old Town ( a very nice array of restaurants,bars and gift shops in a revitalized set of buildings dating back to the late 1880's. You can walk and see a great deal. Legoland is about 45 minutes north of the hotel in Carlsbad. And, about 20 minutes from the San Diego Zoo. Both attractions are family related . You will spend the entire day at each location. Back at the hotel, you will find a parking fee of 10.00 a night. The restaurant located just at the back of the facility has a nice bar,with lots of t.v.s playing sporting events and a restaurant that offers a nice meal at a 10- 20 range . Here's the deal though ! If you are a AAA Automobile member, you can't get a better deal ,period! If you use your AAA card you pay up 20 off per night, 50 off the parking per night and 2 free buffet breakfasts each day of your stay. Use the card and you will return home filled with happy thoughts knowing you had a great time and won't have a huge credit card bill the following month.Thank you for your loyalty! Were honored to receive such a thoughtful recommendation. Indeed, our plethora of amenities plus an excellent location, make us a prime choice for San Diego tourists and business travelers alike. Dont hesitate to reach out to us if there is every anything we can do to make your stay even better.",Good
"Great centrally located hotel, but the highlight is the customer service. Shoutout to Caitlin from the concierge team, super helpful before my arrival. Every team member was super helpful and the room was well appointed. Clean and great bathroom amenities. There is construction happening, but did not experience any noise during my stay. They were proactive and placed a letter and ear plugs in the room to help. Great to see a hotel try to get ahead of an opportunity outside of their control. Another added bonus was the complimentary coffee station the lobby each morning, simple and nice touch. Very happy with this stay and will return again when heading back to Chicago. Thank you for taking the time to complete this review! The Allegro is fortunate to have such a friendly and helpful staff to accommodate guests. We really appreciate your comments about the construction, as well.

"When we arrived, the exterior of the hotel was very colorful and set the tone for a relaxing stay. Christian and Lyle at the front desk were very welcoming. They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.",Good

Nice indoor pool ( the outdoor pool wasn't open yet for the season. ) Two large weight rooms are available, too.We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and l loaded up on the wonderful fresh blueberries. Great hotel!Thank you for the review, come back soon!",Good
"While looking for a cheap place on the fly due to change of plans, I stopped by to ask if there were any rooms available for the night. I was addressed very rudely, and the woman at the desk was not helpful at all, saying that check out was at 11am and since it was already very late it wouldnt be a good idea, and that the only rooms available were very expensive incinuating that I couldn't afford it! And then told me that if I did stay there and wasn't out by 11am, they would call the police. I have never experienced such rude service and have been basically turned down, and it was very obvious it was based on race. Very sad and disappointing. Didn't stay at this motel, and never will.

"Most of the Harbor Boulevard hotels have come to a certain accommodation level somewhere between an Econolodge and a Holiday Inn Express, so there's not a lot to say about the style of the property except what distinguishes it from its sister hotels up and down the street.Google maps is a great way to see exactly how convenient a hotel is to the Disneyland Resort. You basically have two ways to get in - one from the west and one from the east. On the west side is the Disneyland family of hotels and Downtown Disney, so staying on that side you have to go through all that to get to the parks. On the east side, the pedestrian entrance is directly across from the IHOP at 1560 S Harbor Blvd, and when I say directly, you cross the street and you are walking into the front door of the IHOP.The absolute CLOSEST hotel is the Best Western Park Place, followed by the Desert Inn, then you have a tie with the Tropicana Inn and the Del Sol. It's actually closer to the park entrance from any of these hotels than staying at the Disneyland Hotel!I was at first skittish about the hotel for some of the reasons cited in other reviews. It's not a chain, the reviews are varied, and it just looks like it's in a weird place, set back from Harbor Boulevard behind Denny's.The good news is that my fears were unfounded. We had a quiet room with a well-maintained, satisfyingly consistently rumbling air conditioner. Microwave and Fridge in room, tube TV with good Dish network channel reception (SD, and oddly the locals were fuzzy.) Front desk was responsive. Bed was firm and comfortable. Iron and ironing board worked. Safe worked. Didn't use the in-room coffeemaker because we were right next to the breakfast room. Breakfast begins at 7, and is very limited, but serviceable.The big, big issue with the hotel is that they do not have enough parking. Which is *fine* if you plan ahead, and especially if you're spending your whole time at Disney. When they fill up, they start valeting cars. We were also in town for my cousin's wedding, and needed access to our vehicle more than a normal Disney vacationer would. You may want to plan ahead with extra tip money. The valets are available 24 hours, and if one's not visible, they'll call them. I needed my car at 5:00 a.m., and they were quick to respond and get it out... maybe a 15 minute wait.Oh, and for all you parking cost complainers, sorry - that's the price of business in southern California. The state park we went to for the rehearsal dinner had a 3 parking fee!We got our reservations to the Del Sol via Hotels.com on a special, and used one of our 1 free with 10 nights, so the four night stay was very reasonable in price. I would recommend it just as highly as the chain hotels, and would stay here again.",Good
"My husband and I, along with my bestie and her husband stayed at Hotel Nikko for a quick jaunt down to SF from Seattle. We enjoyed our stay, but there were a couple of things... 1. The rooms are MUCH smaller than you think they are going to be and (I know it's weird to mention this, but) the self cleaning toilet was loud and random. 2 The lounge which looks ah-mazing online LOOKS ah-mazing in person, but the hours are inconsistent. Okay, now for the pluses: The check in process and people at the front desk were wonderful! Not to mention the concierge, with whom we steadily checked in, were (there were multiples) VERY helpful. Overall, my husband said he would definitely stay here again, but I'm not 100 sure.Hi Sheryl B,What a great review. We always appreciate specific comments like the ones you left for us, and we have taken note! I'm so glad you found our front desk and concierge staff to be helpful, and enjoyed the hotel over all. Please let me know when you're headed to San Francisco again-- we would love the chance to impress you!Warmest regards,Danielle Ortega, Assistant Marketing Manager415-394-1175",Good
"I was very pleased with the room we stayed in. It was clean and updated. We had a microwave, fridge and table in our room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There are parrots right outside your door which are fun to watch. This hotel is located in close proximity to Sea World and several beaches. We had a blast and would definitely recommend. Dear Conniet,We are delighted your recent stay with us provided you with such a great experience and are appreciative of your 5-star rating! We take pride in providing our guests with friendly customer service, clean, comfortable accommodations, and special amenities to make their stay with us a memorable experience. We hope we will have the opportunity to have you and your family back as our guests again in the future!",Good
"We travel a lot and as SVO members, use a lot of Starwood properties. After only a day, my wife said this has to be her favorite. The people are friendly, there is a lot to experience, and the kids (3 ages 8 to 16) were never bored. The 2 younger ones found instant friends. We did so much that we were all wiped out every night by 8:30. The concierge staff was great at finding us the best deals. One of the things offered was a photography session with Blink. It wasnt on the top of my activity lists, but we hadnt done it in awhile and I knew we might get a holiday card out of it. Tiffany made it fun, quick, and easy. And the pictures came out great. The concierge also booked us a last minute helicopter trip with Sunshine Helicopters to Molokai at a rate that was well below the published rate. We chose them because the price listed didnt have any fuel surcharge* like the others. Snorkeling at Molokini was awesome. Overall, the resorts food, staff, facilities and location are all top-notch. The shuttle service between the Starwood properties and Lahaina is a huge plus. Aloha dencoderek,Thank you for your review. We are so happy to hear that you had a wonderful time and spent time enjoying our most precious gem, Kekaa Beach. Thank you for your kind words about our Concierge staff and Tiffany at Blinnk Photography. I will be sure to share your review with the leadership team. Thank you for grading different areas of the resort. We hope to welcome you back for another great stay. Mahalo, and Be Well.A hui hou! (until we meet again)",Good
"Visited NYC on June 19th with my 12 year old son (his first visit to NYC). Loved the location and proximity to Times Square but was extremely impressed by the service from Julie at the Front Desk. She went out of her way to ensure that we were not only comfortable in our surroundings but to make sure we had subway directions to every place we wanted to visit over a two day period. You are very blessed to have an employee like Julie!Dear Bob L,We ARE blessed to have Julie- she is an excellent employee and we're glad you noticed! We're so glad you loved our location and our proximity to Times Square! We look forward to your next trip to NYC!",Good
"I found this gem by chance on the internet. Yes it is an older motel and with that in mind I fell in love with it. The perfect place to literally get away from it all. Visited with a friend to see Suck Creek Valley, where she grew up and did all the tourist attractions. So this trip was strictly... More",Good
"The surrounding area does not appear safe. However, the actual street the hotel was on was pleasant and in the Garden district. Parking was gated, which was nice. It's also easy to catch a streetcar outside the hotel. It runs every 10 minutes. It was about a 25 minute street car ride. It took about 10 minutes to get to Canal and Burbon street area in our persona vehicle. The beds were comfortable, but were small (full size I believe). We were able fit 2 adults and 2 children in the room. The decor was nice and the lobby was average. We found clothes that were left behind in one of the drawers. The room was fairly clean. The whole hotel smelled like cleaning solution. We stayed one night and did not spend alot of time in our room. It was good for the price. There's also a simple restaurant and bar next door.Monica,Thank you for taking the time to write your review. Our rooms with two beds have two double beds in them. I'm glad you found them to be comfortable! It sounds like your family was able to do a lot in just one night in New Orleans. We are located in the Garden District, which is safe and quieter than other areas of the city. Luckily, the street car makes it easy to get to other parts of the city! It is great that our guests can take advantage of our free parking and use the streetcar. We hope you will come back and visit New Orleans and the St. Charles Inn.Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager",Neutral
"Located on a hillside overlooking Old Town San Diego, the Best Western Plus Hacienda has charm but has a rather quirky layout. It used to be a shopping center and has several levels and elevators that sometimes don't work. Be prepared to walk lots of stairs especially if you're in Building 6 like we were. I booked a room with a two queens and a sofa sleeper for our family of five but when we got to our room in Building 4 there was no sofa sleeper. We headed back down to the lobby and the front desk clerk asked, Are you sure We had to laugh at that. Another staff member offered to show us two other room choices. She walked us around to the rooms and was very courteous and professional. Our luggage was moved from the old room to the new room in Building 6 quickly and efficiently. The parking area for Building 6 is very small and fills up early in the evening. The parking spaces themselves are impossibly narrow and hard to get out of. The local channels on our TV were awfully static and hard to watch while the cable stations came in clear. But in spite of all that, our room was clean, comfortable and spacious enough for our family. Old Town is a great area to stay in with lots of restaurants, museums and things to explore. Plus it is centrally located...less than 10 - 15 minutes to Downtown, Balboa Park, La Jolla Cove and the Airport. Good stay, great location!Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to tell us what you thought! I apologize the room didnt have the sofa sleeper as expected, but Im very happy to hear one of our staff members went the extra mile to remedy the situation and get you into a room suited nicely for your family! Please come see us again the next time you are in the area, and until then-- happy travels!",Neutral
"I am so sad I did not see the ratings for this place before I made 2 nights reservation. My family and I rented 3 rooms and what a mistake! One room had dirty sheets and we had to ask twice before they came and changed them. The maids did not seem happy about the ekstra work and for them where sheets with stains are apprently clean sheets no matter what. They even started to argue about it with my husband!The cable tv was not working proberly and the channels we could recieve was not even the same in all 3 room even though they where located right next to each other. Many of the channels kept on freezeing both the picture and the sound.No airconditioner in any of the rooms. The surrounding area seem quite dodgy, particuly at the back of motel. The homepage promise free high speed internet in all the rooms, but ups! That only works in the lobby! The beds are exstreamly small even acording to european standard! There are no refrigeater in the rooms. The window in the bedroom are plainted over with white paint so people can't look in, but several spots are free of paint and there are no curtain.Buttom line: I'm NEVER comming back again to this place!",Bad
"The Outrigger Luana is awesome... clean, comfortable, quiet, spacious, and by far the most helpful, courteous, happy staff of anywhere we have ever stayed!!! Will recommend to all family and friends. We look forward to staying here again!!!",Good
"Our stay was made very memorable by the incredible view of the Chicago River this hotel provided as well as a very pleasant stay in the hotel itself. We stayed on the 16th floor with an amazing view of the river. We chose a small room, but it was still well designed and comfortable. Great artwork! We appreciated the free wi-fi and coffee in our room as well. Our room was clean and quiet at night. Jay was very friendly and helpful at check in. Everyone we met who worked at this hotel was very nice. Best of all, is the hotel location! The River Walk is right outside the hotel. It is a great place to run or walk if you want, or to just sit and watch all the boats going by. We walked everywhere from this hotel. Great nightlife, museums, Eataly and Millennium Park are all close by. The restaurant Bella Bacino, located in the hotel lobby, had an amazing kale salad and a lighter Italian pizza that was also very good. There's also an outside patio, too. Also, the Corner Bakery Cafe is just down the street. We definitely will be coming back! This is our new favorite location in Chicago.Thank you, travelbuff101, for your thoughtful review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you were able to enjoy the iconic views as well as our prime location in the heart of Chicago. I am especially pleased to hear your comments about the friendly and helpful service provided by Jay and the hotel staff. I will be sure they see your kind words. We are so glad to be your new favorite location in Chicago and look forward to seeing you in the future.",Good

"Decided to stay here on the spur of the moment. Not worth what we paid. It was cleanish, but extremely outdated. I think original dcor from 1967. The bathroom sink looked like an airplane sink. TV Stand, the drawers would not stay closed and there was a bottle cap and folded up paper under one leg to try to make it level. Bed not very comfortable. No windows in the room we where in. The room door barely opened and closed. If all you are looking for is a place to sleep off a hangover and don't care about anything else it would be ok. Not a romantic stay. I wont stay there again",Bad
"Booked a night here for a Staycation with my husband. While we got a good rate for room, I expected a lot more from a resort hotel. Standard room didn't differ much from a chain hotel room. The grounds are gorgeous, yes, but they have to be when surrounded by other properties (no ocean views, etc.) There were two weddings going on at the time, so very busy, and staff seemed focused on wedding parties. The bars restaurants on site on very good, pool is saline which was refreshing and jacuzzi needs to be bigger! Bartender in the Bodega bar had great customer service.",Good
"We stayed here pre and post cruise. The price was right, and it fitted our needs. Soft pillow to rest your head, filling breakfast in the morning, and friendly staff. It won't knock your socks off, but that wasn't what we were looking for! We would stay here again.",Good
"I took a group of Jr. High students for a day at Disney and we stayed at Towne Place Suites in Anaheim. If you're riding the train, the station is close to the hotel. There are several fast food places nearby and the Anaheim Resort Transit picks up here for Disneyland. The continental breakfast is good. Rooms are nice and clean and have a kitchenette if you want to save money on food.",Good
"We have stayed at several Extended Stay America properties in the past because we like the suite layout with the kitchen and it's reasonably priced. The big difference we have found at this location is the extremely friendly and helpful staff, on all of the shifts. We have family in San Diego and it's very pleasant to visit them but it's nice to be able to come back to a comfortable, clean and convenient 'place of own' in a nice centrally located area.The property and the rooms are well cared for. Looking forward to going back in April when our next granddaughter will arrive!Thank you for taking the time write a review of your stay.

Kimpton hotels can be hit and miss. This one was a hit. Great property and location. Comfy room. Awesome pillows. Fancy soaps. I got the accessible bathroom and it was huge.

"Stayed one night in this hotel recently. Excellent location (10 minutes to San Diego Zoo, 15 to Gaslamp). Very friendly gentleman working at the front desk upon check in. Provided lots of information and suggestions on where to visit in the area. For the price it is fine, but I would not recommend staying more than one night. The rooms were updated recently which is a plus.On the minus side, be sure to request a 2nd floor room. We were on the first floor, and heard every single step from the people above us. Nothing but booms and rumbling. Must not be a lot of insulation between the ceiling, and the floor in the above room.Glad to hear you enjoyed our convenient location to various attractions and entertainments in the San Diego area! It's always wonderful to hear that our of our team members were able to make your stay better by providing you with helpful and friendly service. Thank you for your kind words in regards to our recently renovated accommodations. We are very sorry to learn you experienced some noisy neighbors and we wish you would have let us know you were being disturbed. We appreciate your tip to future travelers. We would consider it a privilege to have you stay with us again and be able to provide you with another even better stay. Come back soon!",Neutral
"I have stayed at the property several times and both Ronda and Noelle Taylor make me feel at home when I arrive. I spend time in the lobby, the kitchen area and in the coffee bar and they have everything you need. I enjoy this property because the rooms are like apartments complete with living rooms and full kitchens!!!! I have stayed in the one bedroom King twice and the two bedroom Queen. I love them both but I have to say the two bedroom beats them all because it has two full bathroom and 3 TV's with a desk in one of the rooms. This is the perfect room for the business traveler like me because you can work and not disturb anyone else that may be staying with you in your suite. In addition the sofa in the living room folds out so you can bring the whole family for a weekend. This is an ideal location because it sits between Midtown and Buckhead, so there are restaurants, shopping in at least 2 major malls, The Marta which is the public transit system and rental car locations complete with exotic cars all within walking distance. I can't say enough great things about this property.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online review regarding your recent stay at our hotel.We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. Your review will serve as encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services to provide an exceptional experience for our guests.

Rooms are clean. Beds pretty comfortable. Bathroom counter needs updating as it was peeling apart. We've stayed in many hotels/motels and know not to put the card keys near electronics and other cards in pockets. The room keys only worked for one day. Had to go down each day to have the cards reactivated. Front desk has no idea why this happens. Found it a huge inconvenience.,Neutral

"This room was not clean. There was some red, bloody looking prints on the bathroom door. Also, the dressing and bathroom area was very un-suitable! The bathroom had a sink with no counter around it. So, all my stuff had to be some place other than where I needed them (like my contact lense items, make-up, etc. Then, when you got into the actual bathroom, there was no surface to place anything on, or any hooks to hold your towel. The room was for a handicapped person, but, even a handicapped person needs a surface to hold their towel and clothes. Even the toilet did not have a lid. So, you went in there and where was your towel and clothes to be This room was a disaster. Then, we stayed there on New Years Eve and left on New years day. We left at around 10 am. There was no breakfast. When I asked, they said that breakfast ended at 9:30 am because it was a weekday. I told them it was a National Holiday and they said that they do not celebrate or acknowledge the National Holiday of New Years day. So that was that! We were not pleased!! And will never stay there!!",Bad
