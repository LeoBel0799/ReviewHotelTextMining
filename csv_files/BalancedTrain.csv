"We stayed here recently on our first trip to San Francisco, and I was a little apprehensive to stay at a boutique hotel to begin with, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff at this hotel are great, very friendly and helpful! They gave us a free upgrade, and also offer free wine tasting each night to allow you to mingle with the other guests.Its located in a great spot, within walking distance of Union Square, Chinatown, shops etc.My only piece of constructive criticism, it would be great if the hotel offered breakfast, it currently only offers complimentary tea and coffee. Other than that, a great stay, and I would recommend it!Dear evelyn466,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We are elated to hear the time was able to ensure a great stay and that you enjoyed our unbeatable location, and daily wine hour. We hope to welcome you back in the not too distant future!Warm wishes,Jeffrey Rosenkrantz",Good
"Located just a few blocks from the bus station and Reading Terminal Market, the location is great for tourists! The pool and jacuzzi were small but great amenity, and the room was huge and quiet with a fabulous view, and they provided us with a nice and clean pack 'n play. Breakfast was pricey so we ate daily at Reading Terminal Market's Down Home Diner which was cheap and delish!Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown and for your review and excellent rating. We are delighted our location was perfect for your needs and that you were impressed with your accommodation along with the great view it provided. We are also happy that our on-site amenities were to your liking. However, we are sorry for any inconvenience caused. We enjoyed having you as our guest and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future.Thank you, David KiddAssistant General Manager",Good
Great hotel. The vibe of the hotel makes you feel like you are in another time. Location is great a lot of good bars and eats in the area. Only downside would be wait staff in Supper was very slow and not very attentive. The...More,Good
"We arrived late at night after delayed Virgin flight, it was dark and we missed hotel entrance on first try as the sign is not lit up. The rooms are very generous size, 2 double beds, lovely comfortable mattress pillows, all new, the maid service was good, clean towels daily and room cleaned well. We were on the 4th floor, one room looking over the front of hotel the other room facing the pool, the pool view room was a little noisy at night but not a big problem as once it closed all was quiet again.Breakfast was fine, cereals, fruit (oranges, bananas, apples), bread toasters, bagels, scrambled eggs daily, sausages every other day alternating with some sort of porridge with scone like cakes (Americans call them biscuits), packets of porridge to mix yourself, hard boiled cold eggs, cream cheese, jams, muffins cinnamon rolls, orange juice (usual watered down cheap stuff) apple juice water, was ok but the breakfast area was very crowded with tables so when you went to get food drink you always had to squeeze past other people, coffee available all day. The hotel was still undergoing some renovation work on 3rd floor, 4th floor completed amd 5th floor I think was finished, we had a full size fridge in our rooms which was an unexpected bonus, there was also hairdrier iron + ironing board I didnt use them!) Laundry room on ground floor, 1.50 to wash and same to dry, only 2 machines though, not a problem when we were there but it was fairly quiet. The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful, seemed a safe area although we were in a car so didnt walk in the area at all, TGI restaurant nearby Golden Corral, cheapish buffet restaurant. Was concerned as hotel had changed names 3 times since we booked and had gone down the ratings chart but would certainly go to this hotel again. Very handy for Universal, just a few minutes drive and away from I Drive.Thank you for your kind review. Sorry that you had trouble finding us, our entrance sign is now illuminated. Our renovations have been completed and we hope to welcome you back on your next trip to Orlando!",Good
"Great surprise! Better than expected, we had a nice suite with 2 very comfortable queen beds and a sofa.Our room was clean and without any smell as mentioned in another reviews. It is a very good option for the price in this area close to Universal and walking distance to International drive. Nice staff.We will be back soon!Thank you for taking the time to write such a nice review about your stay with us. We hope you will be back soon!",Good
"I had my wedding here in August. The staff was extra nice throughout the planning process and the wedding went better than expected. The rooms were clean, the staff was helpful, and they accommodated all of my special requests I would highly recommend this hotel to a friend!Thank you for a terrific review! We are so thrilled that we could make your special day flawless. We hope that you and your new wife visit us again for many anniversaries to come!",Good
"The hotel staff was very friendly helpful. Breakfast was nice. Hotel was located close to everything. I would definitely consider staying here again for future visit to Dallas. PL (Third Party Booking) booked me for a King Smoking room, I did not need that the Manager helped me switch to something more accommodating.",Good
We stayed there during the packers game last week. The Morning lady was very friendly. We found out later that she the manager.Quick Check In and the restaurant was great.The hotel is little old but Hey you get what you pay for.Very Nice customer service. I would definitely be back.,Good

"I stayed for 1 night as part of a business trip. It actually looked to be a relatively new hotel or maybe there upkeep is very good. Check in was quick. I noticed when walking to my room the hallway decor was a bit darker than a typical hotel. Brown carpet, dark room doors, I actually liked it better than... More",Good
"This hotel has it all... free WiFi, comfortable beds, free coffee, and ideal location. It's in the heart of it all. The staff (particularly Neil) are so super sweet, nice, and friendly. Everything was great. Yes, if you have a room that faces Bourbon, it can be loud. On the flip side, it is also fun. I got to watch street performers from the comfort of my room or join a friend on a balcony. LOVE.Dear ManayunkMichelle,Were pleased you loved your stay with us and enjoyed our comfortable beds, free amenities, and great location. Thank you for writing us a review, and we look forward to hopefully hosting you again in the future. Take care.",Good
"We picked this hotel based on location and price. San Francisco is very expensive and our son was here with his family for a conference. We liked the location-very close to small markets and restaurants and cable car stops, as well as shopping nearby in Union Square.The staff is very helpful and friendly and check in was fast and easy. The rooms are an average size and the bed was comfortable. There is a mini-fridge in the room as well as a small coffee maker. For some reason our frig kept freezing everything!There are plenty of outlets to charge devices.I only have a few negatives. The bathroom is so small!! You can't stand in front of the sink unless you close the bathroom door! There is really nowhere to hang a towel, except a hand towel. There is very little counter space to put anything. Lighting could be better. There is no light in the entry way where the closet is-so it is very dark to find clothes. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Free wi-fi is always appreciated. It was extremely hot during our visit, so the air conditioner was a big help!",Good
"This hotel is very easy to find, right off the freeway. But wait to you are greeted by the amazing staff and Breakfast gals. They truly make you feel at home and comfortable. I will definitely be staying here again. This will be my go to hotel when I travel to San Diego!",Good
"We wanted to be close to public transportation, the wharf, and attractions. The room was nicely done and we could watch the sunset from our window. We had asked for early check-in but even though they told us we could get in at 2pm they did not have our room ready until the normal 4.00pm check-in. But they did give... More",Good
"The location was perfect for us. Away from the Bourbon St noise and convenient to pick up the tours we had booked from home. Always within walking distance of where we needed to be. I loved hearing the calliope on the steamship in the evening. The staff was always friendly, courteous and greeted us by name. The room was very comfortable. We had a king sundeck room. But our outdoor table and chairs were missing so we didn't get the chance to sit outdoor and just chill. The other 3 sundeck rooms had the table and chairs. Breakfast was average but at least it was there and available in the morning. I wish we had more time to spend in New Orleans. Now, at least I know where to book our room next time we visit. I would definitely book Bienville House again.We are so glad you enjoyed your stay at Bienville House and took the time to share your great experience with TripAdvisor. It sounds like the perfect trip! Please return soon to Bienville House for another great trip!",Good
"It is very close to the medical center and the UIC medical center. I walked from the hotel to the Greek neighborhood and it was just 25 minute walk. It is located close to the metro station.Rooms are spacious, clean, and the mattress was excellent. My only concern is the price, a little bit pricey.Marisa,Thank you for taking the time to give us feedback about your recent stay. We are delighted to know that the location was good for you and your guest room was clean and comfortable. I have shared your comments in regards to the price with the appropriate hotel staff. It was a pleasure having you as our guest. We look forward to accommodating you again, should your future travels bring you back this way.Have a great week!Stephanye",Good
"We stay at this hotel due to the great rooms, service and the year round ability to use the pool/spa. It's also has quick access to Hwy 84 and is only a short time to get to the airport. We'll be staying here again in a few weeks due to this convenience.",Good
"Wish I could rate it at 4.5. This was a clean, quiet, comfortable hotel. The price was what one can expect given the area in the middle of the summer. We were actually right next to the fitness room and close to the lobby but we were never disturbed. It is a short drive to the beach so the savings... More",Good
"My wife had a 4 year old child in Scottish Rite's ICU following a palette repair surgery. This hotel is in very close proximity to the hospital. We walked into the hotel around 10:30pm after a long day of surgery. We were met by a wonderful staff that had our room keys ready, 2 bottles of water, and we didn't have to fill anything out. We were in our rooms within a few minutes of pulling in the parking lot. The hotel was very clean and we were always met by friendly staff members as we came and went over the 2 days we were in the hotel.Dear CP171717,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center. We appreciate your time and comments concerning your recent stay with us. We are happy to know that our location worked out for you and your family.

"I needed a hotel near a conference center in Orlando and had a hard time finding a decent one at a price that wasn't an arm and a leg. This one was about 2 miles from my conference location and was priced better than any around it. The lower price had me concerned but I searched the neighborhood and other reviews until satisfied. Glad I stayed here. It was clean, staff was polite and I felt safe (single woman traveler on this trip).",Good

This hotel staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable and satisfied with your stay there. We've come here many times and will continue to because they make us feel welcome. We could have stayed nearby at other hotels but we prefer how this hotel is r4un by the management.,Good
Located on a private beach area in the middle of two restaurants that are in walking distance. We had a wonderful time. Each room has a outside sitting area. The small kitchen supplied with everything we need all we had to bring was food and drinks.,Good
"Just got back from a great stay at the Historic French Market Inn. It's location in the heart of the French Quarter puts you in walking distance of all the major attractions and if you don't plan on leaving the city, don't bother renting a car since you won't need it. If you're looking for a modern high rise hotel with loads of brand new bells and whistles, go somewhere else!! If you're someone who appreciates the true flavor of New Orleans, then this is the place for you!! The French Market Inn maintains the historic charm of the city with authentic furnishings, high ceilings, and an adorable central courtyard containing a small in-ground pool that doesn't compromise the historic feel of the property. The mattresses were comfortable, the linens were clean, and the large showers had amazing water pressure. The desk and bell staff were polite and very helpful, and I recommend this hotel to visitors of all ages.Hi Christopher, thank you for choosing our historic hotel and taking the time to share your experience. We're glad you enjoyed your stay in New Orleans and we look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back soon.",Good

"Stayed here for a week with my husband and two teenage sons, I choose this hotel because of the reviews and location.Check in and out was very efficient carried out by friendly and helpful staff, Concierge Staff were equally as helpful and professional through out the week.Our room, and indeed the whole hotel, was very clean and tastefully decorated.There was enough space for all of us and we each found the beds to be very soft and comfortable. Only downside was, although it was great to have a small coffee machine, it wasn't big enough nor did we have enough tea or coffee, or even cups for four people. I did ask on several occasions for more, but I did get fed up asking. This also went for the towels, having asked, again on several occasions, we only received three bath towels! We were there 7 days and I had paid for four adults so I am a bit of a loss why this kept happening. It was a bit irritating and slightly lacking on such a good hotel. I hope this will be rectified for future patrons.There is a small gym and a business centre with two computers and a printer, very handy for checking in to your airline and printing out boarding passes.The terrace garden is small but it was lovely to have a picnic alfresco in the city.I can't comment on the food here as we ate out all the time as there are loads of places to choose from locally. Walgreens Supermarket just up the street and left on Powell. Union Square just a little further down.In my book a clean hotel and location is key for me and the location of this hotel was spot on, easy access to all forms of transport, BART from the airport, trams, buses, muni metro and streetcar. Right next to the Chinatown Gate and easy access to all the tourist spots.We all really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and in San Francisco in general, lots to see and do and the people are really friendly and welcoming where ever we went, and to cap it all off the Giants won the World Series and we were treated to a Homecoming Parade in their honour.....awesome.This hotel has good Eco friendly practices and will plant a tree for every review posted.Thank you for your great review, and as promised, we will definitely plant a tree for you for leaving a review on TripAdvisor! As you know we do this for all reviews, but are happier when it is done for a positive review. I'm so sorry to hear that your requests for tea, coffee and towels were never appropriately met. Although it sounds like you enjoyed your stay overall, I will make sure to work with the team so that going forward they can improve their performance. I'm happy that you were able to take full advantage of the public transportation and enjoyed all the sights this beautiful city has to offer! If you ever find yourself traveling back, we would certainly love to host you again!And we agree a clean hotel and location are vital to a great staySincerely,Bruce P.Front Office Manager",Good

We aim to make each guest feel at home when they walk through our front doors!,Good
"We stayed in two rooms for one week. The hotel IS IN the convention center. Had I know this, I would have booked at a smaller place. As a result, it was very crowded and there was no real personal attention. The rooms were clean and offered lovely views. Club level was worth it. Sadly, my young son lost his treasured baby blanket at the hotel. (we think in the laundry). And there were many many tears over that. I think more from me! We asked several times with several people, but it was never found. We are still heart broken.",Good
"1950's bone redone quite recently in an area that is being rejuvenated. Not much available within walking distance yet. Comfy motel-type room, dingy key, on-site restaurant. Great breakfast if heavy on carb side.Close enough to tourist attraction to serve as a base for your visit.Weekend starts on Thu with music by the really nice pool. Don't know how loud it is since I left before weekend. A factor to consider.Thank you for staying with us. Yes we totally renovated the entire hotel in 2014 - mid century modern architecture and design. We are centrally located as w are only 15 minutes away from the airport, 10 minutes away from Wynwood and the Design District, and 20 minutes away from South Beach. We have live entertainment on the pool deck Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights but our policy is to turn down the music at 11 pm and turn it off at midnight. We hope to see you back at the Vagabond very soon !",Good
"We stayed as part of a group. Price was very affordable and a good value for the stay. The entire hotel was very clean. I remember the bathroom being slightly aged but it was nothing to ruin our stay. Our room was a king bed, a nice size with view facing window. The window curtain was just long enough to cover the AC which would have otherwise directly blown on us, and allowing the room to cool to the right temp. The lobby is very charming, with amenities such as snacks and drinks to purchase immediately adjacent to the front desk, and a little cafe and lots of seating. The pool and hot tub are nice, very clean, and a decent size. The lounge chairs are a little overcrowded but there's plenty of seating. It's in walking distance to many shopping centers, delis, coffee shops, and grocery.You'll need your room key to get anywhere within the hotel, including back inside from the pool area.Only complaint is that the advertised check-in time is 4PM which is late. Thankfully we asked if we could get in earlier and a room was ready.The staff - everyone we saw - was wonderful, kind, and professional. We would have loved to have stayed another night.Great for families, couples, and groups.",Good

"This location is a wonderful quite little hidden spot in the Rancho Bernardo area. Check-in- was very quick and easy, and I was even able to check-in two hours before regular check-in(a Super Thumbs-up). All the staff members were very professional and courteous. There were several restaurants within a five to ten minute walk. There was even a Soupplantation across from the hotel, and the pool was excellent. The personal landuary room was great and very helpful. Hilton Garden Inn in San Diego/Rancho Bernardo gets a four and half out of five in my book.

"Our family stayed for 8 nights from May 21-29 at this beautiful property. We stayed in a 1room suite (2 queen beds). On the 5th floor with a pool view. Very spacious,comfortable and clean room.

Always replenishing food with a smile. Never had any issues getting room service (extra towels etc..) Many thanks to Ebony for making our trip a memorable one. The kids loved the resort style pool and basketball. Both a hit with the kids. Visited the parks during days and enjoyed the lovely pool area in evenings. We enjoyed the dinner (M-Th) and order for the Hilton Garden once. Much preferred takeout from Chevy's MexIcan and Fruddruckers and enjoy a nice dinner in the pavillion lounge. The location is close to many restaurants (Chili's, Uno's, TGIF, Fruddrukers, Olive garden and lots more! There is a Walmart Supercenter about 5-10 minutes away if you drive along Turkey Lake road. Nice guest laundry available on 1st floor. Just minutes away are the Orlando Premium Outlets (Vineland Road) and Premium Oulets International is about 20 minutes away. Preferred international ones better. Best family resort in Orlando with everything you need and more. Disney is about 10 min away and everything else isn't too far either.

"I enjoyed a 2 night stay here recently and will surely make this my choice to stay in the Atlanta area in the future. First and foremost, our room was clean and comfortable. The location, being attached to the mall next door, is very convenient. However, the the highlight of my stay was the service of the front desk, concierge and valet/shuttle team. Im sure this was a very busy weekend but all of these individuals were the most proactive service oriented hospitality professionals. They truly seem to want to do everything they can to make your stay top notch. Other members of our party were staying at a different hotel down the road and wished they had stayed here.PS.

"The staff were great. Christian at the front desk was terrific and truly offered a luxury experience. Housekeeping staff did a great job and were nice enough to run my wife's bath prior to returning to the hotel (several times, sorry). Private dining breakfast was not the best but again the attendant was very accommodating. We didn't have a chance to experience the spa and pool. Only negative feedback would be that the windows were not soundproof. Overall a very pleasant stay and would return.",Good

"My husband and I travel to New Orleans often, but the St. James is one hotel that we definitely adore. The location is perfect only three blocks from the French Quarter and a short streetcar ride to the Garden District. The staff is phenomenal! Danielle, Amy, and Tori are the definition of southern hospitality! They were so knowledgeable of the area and gave us great recommendations on where to eat, drink, and where to enjoy a taste of the local perspective. The room was fantastic! We were upgraded to a suite at check-in, and it was definitely one of the highlights of our stay. Needless to say, we will definitely be staying here from now on and we will be telling all of our friends and family about the St. James!Thank you for the glowing review! My staff will be delighted to know we gave you that touch of southern hospitality that we strive for everyday. We sincerely appreciate the recommendation to friends and family and can't wait to provide them with excellent customer service as well! We hope to see you again soon!Warm Regards,",Good

"We had a great stay at the W. The vibe was Seattle cool with live music in Friday night in the lobby. Rooms were modern and clean. Great location to all the attractions, including the light rail from the airport Hello Caryn S, many thanks for your response on your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay and the late night atmosphere! We agree with you, that the location of the hotel is perfect, so close to almost all of Seattle's hotspots. We looking forward to seeing you again!",Good
"This is the largest Hilton Garden Inn I've ever stayed in, 8 floors. Not far from Love Field, so quite convenient. Hotel shuttle driver picked me up at the airport and was very nice and accommodating. Front desk checking in seemed a little inexperienced, but got the job done. Restaurant was very good, server was outstanding. Only a few of the TV channels are in HD, I was quite surprised they haven't upgraded to better reception. Upon checkout, front desk was incredibly helpful in assisting me to get an UBER ride. I'd stay here again just for the outstanding staff.We would like to thank you for your review we have recently hired new guest agents to our staff who are still in their training period but still I would like to apologize for the less than great experience. We would love to service you again.Thanks,",Good
"This place is so well located, you can take the blue line from the airport straight here and its a 4 min walk, with no changes.You are also so close to the river and next door to Les Miserables show at the moment, its easy to get around by walking or on the bus from here.Rooms are nice and free prosseco goes down well every day at 5pm.Great Art Deco feelHighly recommendedHello!

"I spent one night here. Location was great. Check-in wasn't until 3p so we parked across the street for the same price as valet and got our party started early! The room was nice and cool as well!

"This is long overdue. However, my family and I had a wonderful trip from cape cod to this hotel. We drove here, we stayed over Christmas, which we have never not been home before. My family surprised us and showed up too and the front desk helped arrange for them to be right near us! The staff here were friendly, accommodating and the rooms were very clean! This property is a suites property and worked out very well for our family. Hotel was close to restaurants and a short drive to Disney and all the amusements parks which were very fun!",Good
"Great location to stay pre-cruise if you want to visit Seattle. It is directly across the street from the Space Needle, Science Museum, EMP, and an easy walk to Pikes Market, as well as parks along the water for running or walking (to get some exercise we actually walked to Pier 91 which was our cruise terminal). We had a spacious 1 Bedroom Unit (with bedroom door that closes versus the smaller suite that just has a dividing wall and is a bit cramped) w/pullout couch, 2 queens, large well lit bathroom, full kitchen with stove, full size fridge, and microwave. The large unit also has a full living room and a kitchen table that doubles as a desk with plenty of outlets. The beds were comfortable and the suite had 3 TVs (bedroom, living room, kitchen). The small suite (which we did not have but my sister did) has a much smaller kitchen with mini fridge in the kitchen table and only 1 TV that swivels between the bedroom and living room. The beds were comfortable. Good security in that you need your room key to access any of the floors with rooms. A breakfast buffet is included with a pretty good selection. My favorite part was the Omelette station. As soon as you enter the breakfast area, fill out the order sheet indicating what you want on your omelette, and the cook will make it up exactly as ordered. I had this two days in a row and they were delicious. The omelettes are a bit small, but really the perfect size. They also had a great selection of name brand cereal and fresh fruit (among other items). The hotel also arranged car service for us (it is with Ace Transportation...which is not the same as the one online). It was 70 plus tip. The service call you when the plane lands and tell you to call them when you get your luggage. We then waited about 15 minutes for the driver to pick us up. I'm not sure what the taxi's are like, but that option may be easier without the wait. We arranged for the car service in advance since we had 5 people and 5 suitcases...and it was nice having a large clean SUV. The hotel also arranged for us to have Ace shuttle us to Pier 91 for 8 per person. We thought this would be the same type of service but it wasn't. This was an actual shuttle van that we shared with another family. When we checked out at 12:00 we were expecting it to be there waiting for us (due to our prior arrangement) but the front desk had to call and check on it. We probably waited about 15 minutes for them to show up...but the pier is close (2-3 miles) so not a big deal. Due to all the intersections it took about 15-20 minutes to get there. The Hyatt also has a free shuttle within a mile (to and from) of the hotel. They will come when you request it - be sure to tip if you use that service.Other nice items: all staff were very friendly, Walgreens is close-by for snacks and sodas and any forgotten items, monorail is close by, coin operated washer / dryer, free wifi, neighborhood has lots of small restaurants around.Minor items that would be nice if they had (but they don't): More hooks in the bathroom to hang towels in so that you can more easily reuse them, a makeup mirror, a safe for locking up laptops, ipads, etc. (if you need a safe you have to go to the front desk).Dear Brenda S,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories and made the most of our amenities in our beautiful hotel and city. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will be so happy to know they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on retuning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sincerely, Sarah Junge",Good
The hotel was themed around seaworld! They had a shuttle to the park saving the 30.00 parking fee! And you get free fast pass and in park discounts just for staying at this hotel! My family and I couldn't be happier with all the accommodations and the friendliness of the staff!,Good
"We stayed at this hotel after a recent renovation. Outside of new carpeting, I'm not sure what has been renovated. Still, at 60/night on Priceline it was a great value. Our room was a king suite with a separate sitting room that included a widescreen LCD TV, small refrigerator, coffee maker (with Starbucks coffee packets) and sofa. The bedroom also had a TV, but it was not a flat screen.My main complaint with this hotel is that there is no free internet access in the room (it is 9.99/day). There is free internet access in the business center (which is actually 2 computer terminals near the lobby), but they can be hard to get on in the afternoon.Parking is free, and the hotel is very convenient to the airport with a free shuttle.All in all, not a bad place as long as you don't overpay.",Good

We stayed over fall break to take advantage of San Diego's pay for an adult/ child in free. They had remodeled the rooms since we were last there. The bathroom was very nice and so was the bedroom. It came with a mini fridge and microwave plus table to allow us to eat breakfast daily in our room. I hope that they will eventually have a breakfast for their guests because that would make it a perfect location with it walking distance to the beach. We are very pleased that you came back to stay with us. I hope you will come back again soon!,Good
I used to live in San Diego and remember this area as filled with street walkers. I'm glad to report that the area has been cleaned up. The motel is very nice and comfortable. I like the tile floors.

"Three of us stayed in the hotel during the recent AARP convention. It is difficult to find a room to hold 3 who want individual beds. We had 2 queens and a roll away and the room was not crowded. This has huge rooms and we never felt tight. Anytime we called to ask questions of the front desk, out concern was taken care of within minutes and questions answered immediately. The trolley in front was out of service, but the trolley on Canal street and buses are minutes away. You can get every where on these modes of transportation or on foot. Everyone in this city is so friendly and willing to aid tourists. If I ever visited New Orleans again, I would not stay anywhere else.This hotel does not have a pool or spa. It also does not have a restaurant, however there are 100s aroundThank you so much for staying with us during your AARP convention I am so pleased you guys enjoyed your stay!

We stayed at this Fairfield inn in Feb. 2016 with a 2.5 year old. It was perfect for a family. We had a room overlooking the pool which I loved. The pool gets a lot of sun in the morning which is nice for sipping coffee by or if it is warm enough a dip. The pool was heated where we didn't mind swimming in it even when the temp didn't get above 70. Breakfast was better than I expected. The eggs were actually scrambled not like the weird omelet I had before at a budget motel. We always had enough at breakfast to carry us through at least the next cuban sandwich shop. I used the gym there which was ok a few cardio machines including an elliptical and free weights and exercise balls. The nice thing was I was the only one in there both times I used it. The hotel isn't walking distance to much but we were able to find parking every time we went downtown. I think it was quieter because we weren't around any partying.,Good

"After much research on TripAdvisor I plumped for the Galleria Park hotel and I'm glad I did. Only 30 minutes on the train from the airport (a subway platform is only 2 minutes away), this hotel is in a great central location with the trolleys only 4 or 5 blocks away by Union Square and Chinatown or ATT Park short train or cab rides (both easily walkable).The hotel rooms are small but I do not know if that is standard in San Francisco. My brother booked the Deluxe rather than standard, however, and that room was massive!Beds were hard (a little uncomfortable for me) but the room was quiet, the shower was of good quality, TV large and they offered a free wine at the start of the evening.

"We had planned to stay at a different property but hurricane Matthew changed our plans (the fine folks at Hilton were amazing to wave all cancellation fees during this time) and we were able to find this hotel that worked out better.Pros: quick checkin, clean rooms, WALKING distance to Seaworld (saves 20 bucks!), shuttle to Seaworld if you don't want to walk, FAST PASS for major rides (only use them once though - not an all day pass just one per ride), really large room for the type. Speaking of the room - the use of a sliding barn door for the bathroom is a stroke of genius for all the room it adds to the configuration due to the fact they they don't have to deal with a swinging radius. Cons: breakfast wasn't really a con but it was lackluster. Not enough to plummet the stay by any stretch of the imagination. The eggs were super powdery. But there was enough to find sustenance. All in all - great experience.",Good

"This is a typical Marriott SpringHill Suite property -- meaning that it is modern, clean, comfortable, well appointed, served by a friendly, efficient staff -- and affordable. Can't comment on the breakfast because we missed it (came down too late and when they say that breakfast ends at 9 a.m., they mean it. The food is whisked away, so don't be late! The hotel bar is comfortable has a TV screen that may not be huge, but it is big enough that you and a few friends can gather there to watch the playoff games. It may not be right in the heart of downtown Seattle, but it is within walking distance to the top attractions (Pike's Place, Space Needle, the big department stores, etc. -- and most of that is downhill from the hotel.) Plus, the hotel offers a shuttle that runs to and from the downtown area. Bottom line -- we would stay there again.Sounds perfect -- glad you got to enjoy just about everything here and around us! Hope to see you again for breakfast next time you're in the area. Keep in touch! Best, Frank F., General Manager",Good

The room was clean and nicely appointed. No breakfast is included but there is a great little cafe next door for coffee and croissants. Parking was valet only but we found a cheaper rate a block or two away in another lot. I deducted one star because we paid for a room with 2 queen beds (assigned room had double beds), and there was a surprise 20 resort fee added. We didnt get much value out of the items in this mandatory package and were unaware when booking the room. We questioned the bed situation twice and they insisted the beds were queens.

The location was superb as it is situated right in the down town area...MoreThank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers. I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as much as you enjoyed your stay. Take care!,Good
"You walk back into the 60's decor. From the moment we arrived the clerk was helpful. The room was very clean and it was nice to be greeted by Pluto, the bedroom mascot. I do not hesitate to recommend.First and foremost Pluto sends his love! Thank you for taking the time to leave a great review. Glad to hear you got the Pearl service you deserve! Hope to have you back soon!",Good
"This hotel is on it's second or third owner. Hotel Zephyr, known for their trendy hotels, is the current owner and at the time of this review is still in the process of doing some renovations. There is no restaurant, some of the elevator buttons still say Raddison on them, and the elevators may or may not work the entirety of your stay.Overall, though, if you get in on a discount (I suggest shopping online for a good deal, they are always better than what the hotel website offers) then you'll get your money's worth.The service is excellent, the rooms themselves, are magnificent, and your location is perfect. The rooms are unique and several steps beyond your normal chain hotels. The beds are extremely comfortable. We got the standard king room with a view of the city and it was superb. Spacious rooms, excellent bathrooms, and comfortable beds.I highly recommend this hotel. There are three great breakfast places within easy walking distance include Mama's (get their EARLY!), Beach Street Grill, and Hollywood Cafe. All are worth it. The latter two have a shorter wait time typically, but still, get their before you get hungry.",Good
My husband was taken seriously ill whilst we were on holiday in Florida (From the UK) and admitted to the Florida Hospital Orlando right next door to this hotel. I stayed for 13 nights and my husband was with me for 9 nights following his surgery. I had no car (My husband did all the driving) so was relieved that there is a free shuttle which runs between the hotel and the hospital and is available upon request. Wendy's was right next to the car park and there is a 7 Eleven petrol station on the corner so I was able to get everything I needed. Having the fridge in the room and micowave was also very useful. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff whether it was getting extra pillows or faxing my insurance documents to the UK. What I needed most was kindness and I certainly got that from everybody we had dealings with. The rooms are a good size and I had a sofa for my husband to sit on and a desk where I could work. The showers are really good and the bath was most useful for my husband. The large King beds are out of this world -the best beds ever! The breakfast is more than adequate and we appreciated coffee being available all the time. Whilst a number of people stay because of the close proximity of the hotel to the hospital this hotel is a happy safe place and we had lots of fun around the pool whilst my husband was recovering.Yes there are no doubt better hotels in Orlando but not at this price and I doubt whether the beds will be any more comfortable. If you want excellent value for money in a safe friendly environment then book this hotel.,Good
Hampton Inns are always very nice. Convenient parking is limited at this hotel. Nice amenities at the hotel. Close to waterfront park and nice eating establishments. Close to shipyard for government business travelers.,Good
Love this hotel. Nice to have suite and they are dog friendly. Dog rooms are very clean and you don't hear other pets all the time unlike most properties that allow animals. Everyone is friendly and helpful.,Good
"Great hotel with wonderful rooms. The room service was amazing. The lobby offers a quick shop for drinks and snacks. There is also a restaurant/bar in the lobby. My room had both a tub/shower and a stand alone shower which I must say I have never seen in a hotel room. It was kinda cool. I utilized the shuttle transportation twice during my stay and both times the driver was quick and courteous. Excellent experience.Thank you on behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team for your kind comments on our performance. Its so nice to read you loved your well-appointed room and that our shuttle service was convenient for your needs. Ill be sure to share your compliments with my shuttle team. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest, and we hope to see you again soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport",Good
"A beautiful lobby greets you as you enter the St James. Coffee and cool water are available for self service. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I don't think I would use the valet service again, they were very slow. There is an overnight lot across Magazine St. I would use that in the future. The hotel staff said this lot gets full so they recommended the valet service. They did refund the cost for this service after we complained about how slow they were. Overall it was a pleasant experience. The location is ideal, just a couple blocks from Canal St and the French Quarter. Check out the Ruby Slipper for breakfast but go early or there will be a long line.",Good
The hotel is clean and the staff was excellent. There is no shuttle service but you can Uber for pretty cheap. The airport is only about 10 minutes away. The 18 a night for parking is absolutely ridiculous!! The hotel is close to most of the San Diego attractions including old town San Diego.,Good
"Very convenient location--took the Link in from SEA, and the stop was just a couple blocks away. Check in was quick and painless, and they gave me an upgrade per my Globalist (ugh, it pains me each time I type that) status to a corner suite. It was on the back side of the hotel (away from the Sound view), but it was a spacious room with the necessary accoutrements. The bed was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The club had a better spread than some other locations, and ample seating. Otherwise as far as restaurant outlets in the hotel, they had a Ruth's Chris (didn't go) and a deli/convenience store. There's a bunch of places within walking distance though, covering all types of cuisine, and it's very easy to get to the tourist attractions not too much of a jaunt to Safeco Field either.Would definitely recommend.",Good
"Stayed in room 1207 for 8 nights in town for event at Kimmel Center which is a very easy walk away. Room was lovely , spacious with large sitting area, had couch and 2 chairs, coffee table, and dining type table also with chairs. Room was quiet . Restaurant for lunch was very nice great service and food. Nice to have the shops and food court below the hotel.Internet 5.95 a day via T mobile also worked in the Starbucks etc, cheaper than I have payed in many hotels.Would definitly stay again, even my teenagers loved it",Good
"My husband and I stayed for a long weekend and really enjoyed the hotel. Great friendly service, close walking distance to Chinatown and shopping. We enjoyed the decor and the quiet inner courtyard room. Nice and clean too.Wine hour was a great treat too before heading out on the town.",Good
"This was a beautiful boutique hotel with lovely rooms. We had a fabulous stay. it was positioned well for Bourbon Street, Frenchmen Street, French Market, The Paddle steamer and the Trolley. All around a lovely place to stay. The staff were lovely. Breakfast was ok. You need to get there early as once they run out of things they don't seem to have any more eg certain cereals, muffins, pastries etc. It was however a lovely place to stay.We are so pleased to hear you've enjoyed your stay with us! Thank you so much for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor we greatly appreciate your feedback. Please do come see us again soon!",Good
We live in San Francisco and had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights just to act like tourists. Room was great and very clean. Bar scene is fun. All personnel were excellent. Close to Union Square so walking distance of city center.,Good
"Stayed here on business and it was the perfect hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. They booked me reservations at different restaurants and they have a shuttle that will take you anywhere within two miles, and pick you up! They have a good fitness center, a nice lobby bar, and a caf in the lobby. It's the perfect place to stay for business because they have everything you need right there.It was a little pricy but I think there was a conference going on while I was there.Thank you for post. I am happy you found our staff helpful and attentive. We strive to anticipate our guests needs so it is reassuring to learn when we accomplish our aspirations. You mentioned you were here on business and it was perfect for your needs. We have some great weekend rates and packages and might find it a perfect hotel for that weekend getaway too. We are so convenient to many of the restaurants and attractions, not to mention connected to Lenox Square Mall which makes us a perfect destination to unwind. Hope to see you soon for business or pleasure!",Good
"We missed our connection at PHL airport, and the fist thing we did was to find nearest hotel and were so glad that Hampton is just around the area.

"My Adult son and I stayed at the vagabond for 2 nights. I am a huge fan of MCM decor and architecture. This place transported me back to my childhood and family vacas at Florida motels. It is very updated with all of the modern conveniences. Great rooms comfortable and well appointed. There was a pool party on Saturday form 1-7:30pm where music was played quit loud all day. However we were gone most of the day and this didn't bother us too much. Also, we were informed via email prior to our arrival about it. All in all a wonderful place. Continental breakfast is free to guest. The hotel restaurant is great! A little pricey but there are many places near by to eat.The hotel is located in the historic Mid Century Modern district and it was fully renovated less than 4 years ago - we stayed true to the architecture and design of the 1950s era.We do have pool parties only during the summer season (3 a month) for our hotel guests and local residents to enjoy. We try to manage the noise level as best as we can and adhere to noise ordinances. We hope you return for a visit soon!",Good
This hotel has a style to it and I like that aspect given the sameness of so many places. The rooms are fairly narrow and laid out like a loft space which won't agree with many business travelers expectations. The location is OK but anyone who lives or travels here knows the freeway miles will be logged in the Big... More,Good

We spent the week of March 11 at the hotel and had a very nice stay. We had 2 suites (one bedroom suite for my husband and I and a two bedroom suite for son and his wife and 4 children). The 2 bedroom suite was a generous size for the family of six. The one bedroom suite was very nice with a door separating the bedroom from the living/kitchen space. The rooms were neat and clean. We never experienced any problems with housekeeping. The kitchen was fully stocked and had a full size fridge. Plently of room for snacks and drinks. The weather was a little chilly while we were there so the pool was only used one afternoon. But it was well maintained. The staff was very pleasant. The breakfast was fine. We did not partake in the evening menu so we cannot comment. But it was nice to have that option. The location was close to the Disney Parks and other attractions. We would return to this hotel again.,Good
"Clean, new and great location. Right next to the interstate for easy on and off. Close to shopping (Atlantic Station), resturaunts and you can jog to Piedmont Park.

"Overall a very nice experience at the Comfort Suites. Positives: The staff were ALL incredibly nice and helpful. Rooms were clean at check in. Washer and dryer in the room was a terrific perk, and came in handy with a week long stay. Nice breakfast - simple, but always had fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal and then the usual cooked items. Location could not be better, lots to see and do in the area, and lots of dining options.Not such positives:Daily housekeeping could do a better job - cleaning off kitchen counter, throwing away used coffee cups, etc. Rooms are a bit dated, and the sofa bed is in serious need of a new mattress (could feel every spring). Air conditioning was not great - especially in the hallway near our room. Only 2 elevators (tall, narrow hotel) so sometimes had to wait quite a while to get back to our room (or down to the lobby). we were on the 20th floor, so walking down stairs was not a great option.Dear TravlinGal1959,Thank you so much for your recent 4 star review. Thank you so much for your great positive comments on the team members, room being clean at check in and our amenities. Next month all of our sofa's will be replaced with memory foam mattresses and new sofa's. I do applogize for this experience but we are working on replacing them. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",Good
"We had a wonderful stay at the St. James between 5/19-5/22, while visiting Nola to prepare for our upcoming move there. Our room was lovely, clean, small but comfortable. The bed was luxurious, lots of pillows and I think a mattres topper, in addition to being huge! The staff was great, from checkin, where Amy was as nice as can be, chatting and giving us tips, throughout our stay. Housekeeping changed our towels and replaced the complementary toiletries daily. This isn't a big chain hotel, its a historic building and it does have it charms/quirks, but to us that's what Nola is about. We will certainly be using the St James again whenever family comes to visit.Thanks for choosing to stay with us at the St James Hotel in New Orleans. We know when you are traveling you have many options to choose from when it comes to a place to stay. We are absolutely honored that you gave us a chance and took your time to write a review on Tripadvisor!!!

"This is our second year that we have stayed some nights in this downtown location. For a tour coach that comes in with 50 people, having three elevators is a huge bonus. Located within reasonable walking distance to many businesses, tourist attractions, and about a 20 minute easy walk to the French Quarter. The new addition to this complex will certainly enhance the appeal once it opens later on this year.",Good

"My teenage daughter had a dance across the EMP and this was literally across the street ! The view is amazing and the place was very chill and for a hotel chain, it felt like a local neighborhood place as everyone at the front desk were so friendly and helpful particularly a shout out to the shy and very sweet Matthew. They do have things you can borrow from weight scale to clothes steamer, but only a handful so it's usually checked out. Parking downstairs but they have a 24 hour shuttle that can take you around town.petitejetsetter,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review!

The huge bathroom and super deep bathtub was awesome. Special shout out for Tina who was our room attendant who left us personal notes each day after servicing our room. Loved the proximity in the gas lamp, we could walk to so many things. We would stay here again when visiting SD again.I cant thank you enough jadoc for your glowing review! We have an incredible team here that genuinely cares about every guest that walks through our doors and I am beyond thrilled that you experienced it firsthand with Tina.

"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the St. James for two nights. The hotel room was clean and cozy. Extremely comfortable bed. The staff could not do enough to make our stay more perfect. It was our first visit to New Orleans and they helped make it wonderful. Amy, Toshiba, James, Tori, Ashley, and Danielle were so helpful with directions and suggestions. Amy told us exactly where to get on and off the street car so that we would have a seat. When we would come into the lobby we were greeted by name and asked how we were doing, where we had been, like we were family. James is the nicest bell hop, he suggested we go to Mother's restaurant our first night, it was so good. We will be back to stay at the St. James again and see all of our friends there.

"We spent seven full days here, Tuesday to Tuesday. It was the perfect spot for Southern Decadence. Not in the middle of it all in terms gay-world (that would be St. Ann and Bourbon) but only three blocks off. It was crazy-noisy from the balcony we had on Bourbon Street, so I wore earplugs to sleep (even though we rarely wen to bed before 3:30 or 4am, it was still loud!) But that was to be expected and part of the fun. Great staff, very respectful. They check room keys after dark, which I really appreciated. And we hung out on our balcony in just our underwears and threw beads to the men who earned it, and never got any grief. Very open to all types, very gay friendly. It was clean, too. And no smell of smoke. We would go back in a heartbeat.",Good
"We stayed here for a few nights on our trip to Disneyland. We have four kids and it fit everyone comfortably without having to get creative. I liked the bunk bed option, which was a nice change of pace from the sometimes-dubious sofa bed. The room was very large and clean. The bathroom was nicely configured with toilet and shower in a separate room from the sink and fridge/microwave area. We did have an issue with a clogged sink late one night, but management was able to send someone out the next morning. And like everyone says, you can't beat the location! When you have young kids it's so nice to be able to hop back from the parks for afternoon naps and weird potty training issues. Breakfast is basic, but the kids sure loved the mini-donuts. I'd stay here again when we come back to the parks.Dear meisum,Thank you for your great review. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We strive to offer the best for all of our guests. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with other travelers and look forward to your next visit!",Good
"I'll start by saying if you're looking for over the top, extraordinary, then this is not the hotel for you. But, if you're looking for something that is clean, has a great art deco fitout, and in a TERRIFIC location, then keep reading. Location - in the Theatre District which means that all the major theatres are easy to walk to. Millenium Park is about a 7 minute walk. The Magnificent Mile is about 15 mins walk (could probably walk faster if people didn't walk 3 abreast the path).Rooms - we had a room on the 5th floor. It was fine, bathroom a bit small with very little counterspace. Beware - the bottles of water left out on the desk are NOT free. Bed was very comfortable. Pillows were awful - either little more than some cotton wool bunched together or a huge bag of cement. Rooms were quiet. There was evidence in the hallway of someone's big night out a couple of rooms down but we didn't hear a thing. Staff - polite enough, but nothing special. Great to let us have the room a bit earlier than regulation checkin. The late checkout is very handy. They can keep your bags for you while you wander the city. Concierge were particularly helpful but no one else could help with directions to theatres, bars etc. Disappointing. Valet car parking - at 63/night, it's definitely not cheap, but they will hold your car until 6pm which is great if you're catching a matinee show somewhere. There are plenty of self park lots nearby. Would we stay here again Probably!Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of our excellent downtown location! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!",Good

"We stayed here for 5 days. We were a family of 10, with 3 reserved rooms. I chose this Hampton Inn because of the reviews here. We like the Hilton/Hampton brand very much because of its quality of service and cleanliness.This is a newer hotel (aprox 1yr ). It is beautifully decorated. Check in was easy. Rooms were super clean and well appointed. Yes, there is construction on both sides of the hotel but we were never bothered with noise. Beds are so comfortable that you fall asleep in no time. Room had a microwave and refrigerator. Breakfast was good and included eggs, ham or sausage, breads , pastries, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea, waffles, juice and cereal. Everything you need to start your day with a full belly. The employees in the breakfast area were very very nice and acomodating.Hotel includes wifi and free parking. It is at walking distance to Sea World, CVS, 7 Eleven and a seafood restaurant. Also, they have a shuttle to the parks. Easy access to the highway and International Drive. Highly recommended!!",Good

"This hotel is centrally located close to the many attractions that San Diego has to offer. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I was traveling with a group of just over 20 people and upon our arrival they had all our rooms ready for check in. But, not only that, they also had all our keys labeled with our names and room numbers already on them. That made for such a smooth registration and check in (as well as check out). Our stay was for 4 days and 3 nights. Another convenience the hotel provided was a shuttle ride to and from the SD Zoo. Eliminating the chore of fighting through traffic, driving (in an unfamiliar area), and parking. The rooms were well maintained, clean and had small refrigerators in each room. The hotel also has a pool (which we didn't have time to use) and a restaurant serving home cooked meals on site. I also liked that it was quiet.Dear MariaLC60: Thank you for your nice remarks in regard to your recent stay. It is certainly appreciated! We are so glad that you enjoyed our friendly and efficient Staff, as well as our complimentary shuttle service that offers transportation to many local area attractions. It is a delight knowing you also appreciated our well maintained guestrooms, quiet property, and the convenience of a pool. Perhaps, you will have the chance to utilize it on your next visit. We are happy that you loved our onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner from 6am-10pm for our guests convenience. Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your hotel accommodations and for being our guest! Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff",Good

"Renaissance Atlanta Waverly Hotel Convention CenterI had the occasion to attend the Revolution Chiropractic Convention in Atlanta. The convention was held at the Renaissance Waverly Hotel, this is a Marriott Property.The Hotel was up to the Marriott Standard, the young lady that checked me in, I think her name was Leah, she was delightful as well as very helpful. The room was spacious and clean, and the convention rate made it reasonable for a Marriott property. The bed in the room was amazing, it was like sleeping on a cloud, wow! So comfortable! For one who likes to sleep in a very cold room, I was a little disappointed that the lowest the thermostat would go was 65! I dont know if thats normal, in most hotels the first thing I do is to turn the air down to 62.I tried the breakfast buffet the first morning I was there, a little steep at about 22, can anyone eat 22 worth of food for breakfast It was awesome, they had EVERYTHING imaginable on the table. I ordered room service one evening, the burger was good, the service was fast and courteous. I was a little surprised, I ordered soup and was not given any crackers! I tried to call down, but they were so busy the phone was not answered.Overall a very good stay, I would certainly visit this place again.It is wonderful to hear about your fantastic stay with us and we appreciate the great comments. We hope that your travels bring you back to stay with us again. Thank you!",Good

Ocean Park Inn is right on the beach. There is access that exits to the boardwalk and from there is beach access. Our room was ocean front. Our 3rd floor room had a balcony that looked down on the boardwalk and beach. We sat in the room because it was chilly out and watched the sunset. How great to open the door and hear the roar of the waves. Our room was nice. A little old but clean and quiet. The one negative is that the room was dark when the sun went down. There is breakfast daily. Underground parking that cost 15 a day. There are plenty restaurants with walking distance.,Good
"We moved to this hotel from two doors down and were extremely pleased. The rooms have been renovated in the past 2 months and were clean and fresh, albeit small. I recommend buildings 1,2, or 3. The grounds were lovely and calming and the pool was clean. Downsides: No continental breakfast, slow internet connection, a microwave didn't come with our room and the shuttle times weren't great for young children. Also, the TV channels were extremely limited, and there's no DVD player, but you can pay for Disney shows or Curious George at 4 each episode. We walked over to Bunz for food which was better than the restaurant. Great location, close to everything, but you need a car.",Good
"Stayed here for business - the room was large and there was plenty of storage. My room had a mini-fridge that I gleefully utilized for the 3 nights I was there. The most memorable thing about this place was the bed, and the mattress specifically. Hands down the MOST COMFORTABLE mattress I have ever slept on. Plenty of power outlets to charge all my gear, and lots of room to store my clothes. This room could easily accommodate 2 guests. Limo service was onsite for a trip to Hartsfield when I left. Nice place, beautiful inside, large clean rooms, and the upgrade breakfast was excellent. Would definitely stay here again.Thank you for the feedback, come back soon!",Good

"This hotel was perfectly located for our Chicago/Hamilton mini vacation. I went here with my parents and we were delighted with the size of the suite. The living area was spacious and had a small pull out sofa, a chair and desk area. Plenty of room to rest or visit when not seeing the sights. The location was great for seeing Millennium Park, boat tours, theater for Hamilton and the Mag Mile. It was easy to stop in to our room to have a short rest, or somewhere to put up your feet for 30 minutes while out seeing Chicago. The breakfast area was slightly cramped, but we always found a table. It offered pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, cereals, yogurts, breads and fruit. My only downfall would be the pull out bed-it had the bar, like majority of pull out sofas do. But it definitely was not the worst that Ive slept on. I slept fine all 3 nights we stayed there. If you are taking the train in, get off at the State Lake stop. It was an easy 5 minute walk from there. I would definitely come back to this hotel. Dear Carriehep,Thank you so much for your recent 5 star review. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed our prime location on Michigan Avenue.

"We took a detour from North Louisiana on our anniversary weekend-forgetting that it was also St. Patrick's Day! We ended up in New Orleans and enjoyed touring many familiar and favorite neighborhoods. We made our way slowing down Magazine Street close to where we onced lived and realized that a St. Patrick's Day parade was wrapping up! Desperate to find accommodations my husband walked into the Drury Inn on Poydras St. and booked the last room of the hotel.The lobby was lively with happy hour and we enjoyed a quick glass of wine before going to our room on the first floor! We were amazed at the quality and comfort considering the low price we were offered! ( Ask for those military and senior discounts.) The staff was courteous and friendly, the room quiet and comfortable! The inn is close to the quarter and cost a mere 6 for a friendly cab ride! We were dropped off right at the start of the parade on Bourbon St and enjoyed a after-parade drink in another hotel on Canal. We were fortunate to meet the Grand Marshall's family and enjoy their story of life in and around New Orleans!

"I stayed a total of ten nights while in town on business.I would consider this more of a motel than a hotel. The price is too good to pass up for a place with very good reviews when compared to the other options in the vicinity of downtown. Each night the bar/restaurant on the ground floor draws an eclectic mix. The food and drinks are outstanding and the movies shown in the courtyard each Wednesday night make for a fun atmosphere.The rooms are very simple, but nice. The main issue I had was with the noise level in the room. Even with a room at the back of the building, the early morning traffic noise from the busy street on which the Pearl is located easily was enough to wake a person and keep them up. Facility parking is not free, but there is ample street parking a block away.Don't check out before trying the Brussels sprouts at the restaurant.Appreciate you taking time to leave us a review. truly appreciate your support and comments.

This hotel was very new and modern. Very clean. Staff friendly. It was clean and is located near the airport. We had a nice water view. There was no shuttle or room service.

"We called the hotel directly and were told we would have a walk-in shower, and that handicapped parking was directly outside of the handicapped rooms. We were given a non-handicapped room the first night, and parking was not close. They provided cones to block-off a space to allow for close parking and moved us to a handicapped room. The staff was very professional (other than one who swore in Spanish). We would probably stay again if they decide to create more accessible parking.Good Morning,I appreciate you taking time to review your stay with us here through TripAdvisor.

"This location is less than 10 minutes from the rental car area. The room was clean and everything we needed was present. We called for additional towels and they were brought to our room immediately. The breakfast was nice, but if you go at a busy time, there is a high probability that you will have to take your meal back to the room due to the limited seating during peak times. The pool was nice and my kids enjoyed it. There was no deep end which was nice for young children.

Not only did they provide great service, but we also had a killer view of Pike's Place and the Space Needle from our room.

We will be back to stay here again.",Good

"Check in at this beautiful hotel was effortless, professional and helpful. I asked for two restaurant recommendations and both were winners! We stayed four nights in room 804 which at first glance appeared smaller than expected, but, as it turned out, was just the right size for our two overhead sized suitcases to place on the luggage racks. The room includes a desk with chair, a refrigerator, a small three drawer chest, two night tables, a nice sized closet with lots of hangers, room safe, and a most comfortable bed. Water pressure in the shower was not so good. Wake-up call service did not happen on one of the two mornings that we had requested. Our room was immaculate, linens were great, lighting, both natural and artificial was really good and the location was absolutely perfect!! Within walking distance to many attractions and less than a two minute walk to China Town! Breakfast was included with our room. The restaurant is beautiful and relaxing and the server, Worem, is exceptionally welcoming, warm, and most attentive. Breakfast was a hit and miss, one day perfect and the remaining days, sadly, off. Highly recommend visiting Alcatraz, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory at 56 Ross Alley in China Town and of course, walking around China Town.It's fantastic to hear you had an effortless stay! We're always so happy to give any recommendations, and we're glad they ended up working out for you. Please keep us in mind the next time you're in San Francisco. It would be great to see you back.

"This is the 3rd time staying at the hotel, so obviously we like it. The location is not too far from L.A. for a quick getaway. I think the price can be a bit high, we only stay if we get a good deal and so try to book early and with a AAA discount.The grounds are beautiful, it feels like a Hacienda. The pool is fairly large as is the jacuzzi. There's nice lounge chairs and it never seems too crowded. A good mix of young, old, families, business people having conferences, etc...No one will feel out of place. It is on the quite/reserved side though so I'm not sure how much kids would like it. We usually stay here with our teenagers when we're doing something in San Diego or La Jolla (water skiing, snorkeling, etc...) otherwise I think they would be a bit bored too.Food is fairly expensive, we usually try to do the Mustang's happy hour and then eat out other meals. I don't think I would recommend the food if we paid the full price vs. happy hour prices. The lengua tacos were fabulous as were the chicken wings. Moscow Mule was delicious, but it was strange they ran out of copper mugs. The bar/restaurant was very empty but they had to take our mugs from us at the table and refill for the second round. Service was friendly and fast.Rooms are comfortable, this time we stayed in basic room and didn't have a balcony which I missed. It's pretty to sit out and view their landscaping/fountains, etc..It feels very secluded. They provide you with a bottle of wine in the room which is a nice touch.Gym isn't large but has what you need- about 7 or 8 cardio machines, a few weight machines and free weights. It got a little full, but we were able to do our full routines both days with no issues.There were just a couple of negatives: self parking is so expensive at 25.00 a day. I really wish hotels would just add that in to the nightly room fee along with the resort fees. Each night ends up being 50 more when you add in extras like being able to park your car. Also they offered free coffee/tea service in the mornings but from like 5-6:30 a.m. in the morning which is insane. Who wakes up at 5 in the morning on vacation Either offer the coffee/tea at a normal time which is a minimal cost to the hotel and garners good will to guests or take it away.Dear bakeshop,Thank you for being a frequent and loyal guest at Estancia we're thrilled to be your hotel of choice when visiting the San Diego area. It's wonderful to hear how much you enjoy the peacefulness and beauty of our award-winning grounds, along with the comfortable luxury of our guest rooms, and the friendly hospitality of our staff. We appreciate you, once again, taking the time to share such a detailed review of your experience at our resort and we are looking forward to welcoming you back to Estancia again soon.",Good
"For those who require wheelchair accessible rooms, you will find this Marriott a very good option. The bathroom size was excellent but the room was somewhat hard to manoeuvre as the furniture is quite bulky and did not provide much room for turnaround.Also, this Marriott has a wheelchair accessible van (brand new) and will drive visitors within a 1-mile radius which includes UIC, Rush, John Stroger (Cook County) and to Little Italy and Greek town - they also pick up!Restaurant food was excellent and very generous",Good

"Ok, let me start by saying I do not care for hotels so it's rare that I'm impressed by one. I recently visited the New Orleans for the first time the weekend after Mardi Gras. We decided to walk around before checking in and it became late in the day. I received a call from the hotel manager who called to let me know they would still hold our room for us. I thought that was very nice. We arrived at the hotel and I was skeptical when I saw the outside of the building. My boyfriend reassured me that inside was probably much nicer and most buildings in New Orleans look like that on the outside. I was amazed from the moment we stepped foot in the lobby!!! The staff were courteous and the room was more than clean. I always inspect the bed and the shower upon entering my room and I couldn't find ONE thing to complain about, which is very rare lol. We also went down to the 5:30 Kickback where the hotel provided free food and and drinks. Overall, our stay was well worth every penny spent!! I have to say this will be my hotel of choice from now on whenever I visit.",Good
"I had the chance to stay at this hotel during my first visit to LA. The rooms were nice, the beds were comfy, and the food was good. Within walking distance of many great places to eat and just a few blocks from the trolly to the French Quarter, I couldnt have asked for a better place to stay.

"In March 2013, I spent a long weekend at Estancia and really, really, really enjoyed it. The food, in particular, was delicious at every meal. Everything appeared and tasted fresh, whole, and real. The spa was lovely and all employees were true professionals and excellent at their craft. Also, notable was the valet staff who always took good care of us coming and going. We also enjoyed the hot tub, especially on cool March evenings. I used a Romance Rendezvous Package that, upon checkout, I was please to discover was truly an excellent value -- the bill could have been much higher, but it wasn't. I highly recommend Estancia to anyone looking for a lovely, romantic getaway at a fair value.Thank you for writing a review about your stay last March.

"My friends and I stayed here for three nights for a very reasonable price during the month of May. The room was very warm and welcoming with extremely comfortable beds.

"Quick one night stay in Nov 2017. Staff was very courteous and I was upgraded to a large room on the executive floor. Decor is a bit dated but overall well maintained.Location is excellent - the hotel is co-located inside the Lenox Square Mall complex so you're a short drive / walk away from many stores and restaurants.The breakfast experience in the executive lounge is typical of these large chain hotels selection of food isn't anything to write home about and the space isn't large (see pic) but you have very nice views of downtown Atlanta.Overall, it was a positive experience but I might consider staying at the Ritz Carlton next time I'm in Buckhead.Joe M - so happy you decided to stay with us and glad you enjoyed the hotel and location.

"It's hard to review a hotel located in a place like the French Quarter as it is not going to be your typical hotel - it will be crowded, space will be at a premium and it can invite a crowd that will not be for everyone. I was traveling for the first time to New Orleans and brought the family (which includes two teenage boys) so I was a bit nervous about what I was getting myself into. I was very pleasantly surprised by my choice of the Four Points for many reasons.First, the property couldn't be more centrally located - its right in the middle of Bourbon St. Second, the hotel, despite its location and the type of crowd the French Quarter attracts, is extremely clean and well maintained. The rooms, while a bit on the small side, were modern (while maintaining some of the French Quarter character), and clean. Couldn't have asked for more. Third, the place was reasonably quiet - it may have been the time we went (middle of the week in July) but we never lost sleep. Fourth, the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Only a few negatives - Parking is expensive (30/day) and the house keeping a bit slow - they didn't clean our room until the early evening.A couple of tips - if you want a Bourbon St. view but not the noise, request a 5th floor room. You won't have a balcony but you will have a view of the action with less of the crowd noise. Also, if driving be sure to enter via Toulouse St. - French Quarter can be very confusing with all the one way streets and parking is not available on Bourbon St.Dear whisox,Were happy to hear you loved your NOLA experience with our hotel and enjoyed our great location convenient to all of the excitement on Bourbon Street. Thank you for your raving review and sharing your tips to future guests! We cant wait to see you again. Take care.",Good

That said, the hotel was a great place to come back to at the end of the day.We had a one-bedroom suite. Our room was maintained well, very clean. One 2 occasions we asked for more towels, which were brought promptly. It was nice having the extra space when kids needed to nap and the well stocked kitchenette to keep snacks.Free breakfast was a plus. Nothing super fancy, but all the basics. We typically ate first thing in the AM. This was a high volume time and there was usually a line for the delicious Mickey waffles. Staff in the breakfast area was attentive and kept the area clean and well stocked.We enjoyed the evening reception once. I was surprised to find a fresh salad bar!The area around the hotel is very busy, expect to wait at restaurants and be stuck in traffic if you come during busy season. It does take a fair amount of time to get to the outlet mall, which is visible from the hotel, so give yourself enough time. If you are dining, take advantage of call ahead seating.It was freezing, so we didn't get to enjoy the pool but it looked nice. Also, our room faced the interstate and I was ASTONISHED that I could hear NOTHING at night. It was soundproofed extremely well! Ample free parking as well. Cool radio activated keys.We would definitely recommend this hotel for travelers!",Good
"Friendly, clean and very well appointed. Could not ask for more. Although we did not dine there, the food looked excellent as well. Great coffee in the morning. Will definetly return and recommend to friends!",Good
"Stayed here during June of this year, the staff was very friendly. The front desk people are hilarious and kind. The rooms are nice, honestly for the low prices I expected it to be like a super 8 with blankets that looked like my grandma's curtains but it was a very nice room! Anything I needed they were happy to... More",Good
"This Courtyard is somewhat a hidden jewel, a very quiet property, newly renovated, and only 10-15 minutes from the Kentucky Horse Park. A nicer pool and spa area than most properties. Plus the convenience of the Bistro if you want to stay in during the evening.",Good
"Came here for Disneyland. Joy was a great front desk agent, super nice. I had book two different types of rooms for each night and she was able to just let me stay in the same room. She was very accommodating and remembered my name. The room was big enough for two people and they had a kitchen, which was nice. Would stay here again. Great job Joy!We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It wastruly a pleasure to serve you.We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback.

"After spending a previous spring break at the Hilton Resort on Mission Bay, we decided to find a place on the ocean. The Ocean Park Inn was the perfect place for our family to stay. Based on reading other's reviews, we requested an upper floor ocean front room. The view from our room was fantastic and we even found enough space on the small balcony to enjoy a cold drink and watch the sunset. The best part is the location. Being right on the boardwalk meant we barely used our rental car the entire trip. We walked north on the beach and explored the tide pools, we walked to lunch, we walked to dinner and were never bored walking south from the hotel.If we are ever in San Diego again, Pacific Beach and the OPI is where we will stay.We're happy to hear you and the family enjoyed spring break with us! You're absolutely right about our location - there is so much to do within walking distance, but at the end of the day it's also nice just to enjoy the breeze and sunset from your balcony! Thanks for uploading some great pics as well - we'll see you next time.",Good
"i love staying in hiltons, they are always great. Only complaint the computer had some log on issues and the front desk computer was very very slow, 20 minutes to check out, otherwise the hotel is in a great great location in french quarter, food, service everything was great (just couldnt pull up my emails in business center) otherwise it was great great.Thanks for staying with us while you were visiting New Orleans. I'm glad that for the most part, you enjoyed your stay. Although our front desk computers are due for a hardware upgrade, I find it hard to believe that the computers were the cause for it taking 20 minutes to check out. Perhaps it was operator error The staff at the desk is fairly new, but they shouldn't really have many problems checking somebody out. I will get with the staff to see if they remember any specific issues with guests checking out over the past few days. Thanks for your feedback, and we hope to see you again real soon.",Good
"Very nice hotel- spacious clean room- nice free crossaint breakfast- friendly staff- cute courtyard- pool is more the size of a hot tub though. Walking distance to all downtown sites yet not in a crazy area that is loud and partying all night Dear Christie R., Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback on your stay here at the St. James Hotel. I truly appreciate your comments about our rooms, breakfast, staff, and courtyard. We also love our great location in the city! It is so nice to be so centrally located, but just far enough away from the nightlife to be able to sleep through the night! I do hope that you consider staying with us the next time that you visit New Orleans!Sincerely, Burton HimbertAssistant General ManagerSt. James Hotel",Good
"Hotel was super nice, room was big and very comfy. Everything was super clean and well presented. Staff at check in were very accommodated. Breakfast was good, we had the room plus breakfast package which was a great deal. The price per night was a little over our budget but it was worth it! Great hotel",Good
"The hotel was great and the staff were very accommodating. The pool and room were very well maintained. They had put us though in a room right near the pool and was a bit loud at times, especially on Sundays at the pool party. Would recommend requesting a more secluded room if you are looking for a more chill time. Overall, I would recommend this place. The pool has a nice bar and the restaurant at the hotel is delicious.Thank you for your review and I am sorry that your room was a bit loud. Some of our guest like to be in the middle of it all. Please be sure to request a more private/quiet room on your next visit.",Good
The check-in staff were helpful and friendly when we arrived at 10:30pm. There was a small kitchenette that was perfect for a late night cup of tea while settling in. Parking was convenient and the property seemed safe and clean.Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for your comments about our staff and rooms. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and it was of value to you. We hope to see you again in the future.,Good
"Hotel a few blocks away from the French Quarter. It is also convenient to transit. The room we received was a good size and comfortable. The hotel offers a good continental breakfast in the morning, popcorn and fountain drinks in the afternoon, and kickbacks starting at 5.30pm. There was some good munchies especially for teenagers. There offer free wi fi, which was added bonus. We would stay here again,",Good
"We have just stayed here for 3 weeks and had a fab time! Hotel room clean and comfortable. Everything we needed there inc a fridge, iron, hairdryer, decent tv channels. Breakfast was great! A healthy choice available. Hotel staff really helpful. Pool area was nice and quiet. Would definately recommend this hotel and would stay here again if back in orlando.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about our hotel. We are delighted that you enjoyed your time with us and hope you will visit us again soon.",Good
"We stayed her for a night while visiting New Orleans and was very pleased with our choice of hotel.The hotel was very well located to walk around the city and a good location for driving into.The hotel room itself was an average size and big enough for our needs. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The room had a fridge and coffee making facilities but did not have a safe. The bathroom was a bit on the small side with a toilet and bath with shower over and a sink outside the bathroom. The bathroom again was very clean. The room was very quiet we never heard a noise all night.There was valet parking available for 30 per night.The complimentary breakfast was good, there was plenty of choice and it was well organised with a clean breakfast area and helpful staff.The night reception was excellent. There was unlimited soft drinks available, 3 alcoholic drinks per person and food. The food was best we have ever seen at an evening reception this included hot dogs, nachos, baked potatoes, salad, chilli.There was also popcorn available late afternoon into the night time available in the lobby area along with coffee and soft drinks. I think soft drinks were also available for a few hours inthe morning. The staff at the hotel reception were very friendly and helpful.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New Orleans and if we ever return I would stay here. I will also look out for Drury Inns now when our travels.",Good
"We were in Philadelphia so our daughter and friend could attend the Taylor Swift concert. We searched online for days looking for a good rate for a one night stay. Just two days before our trip we came across the Fairfield Inn at a very good price. The front desk personnel made the reservation process a breeze. Upon arrival the hotel staff were friendly and courteous and made us feel welcome from the minute we entered the lobby. It was easy to tell they enjoyed working there. Everyone greeted us with a smile and friendly 'hello'. The newly renovated rooms were clean and comfortable. The pool was refreshing and breakfast was delicious. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great hotel experience and a convenient location.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. That was an extremely busy weekend. We had a hotel full of Taylor Swift fans! It was awesome! Feel free to give me a call if you are ever in the Philadelphia area again so that I may be able to personally assist you!Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.",Good
"This had a nice location, near transportation options and also near a lot of restaurants. However it's most outstanding deals was the (relatively) reasonably priced hotel, and as a bonus it has parking if you are driving through the area.The room was spacious enough and clean. No breakfast offering, but it was near plenty of dining options.",Good

We're glad you and the entire family were able to take advantage of the amenities on the property too. We look forward to seeing you next time.",Good
"I enjoyed our stay here. The staff is accommodating and pleasant. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The sheets, pillows are luxe. We didn't even have to share an elevator ride. I was impressed with our stay. Didn't have to sign in to the wifi each day of our stay. It was the little things at the Conrad that made for a memorable visit in Chicago.Dear 6tribes, Thank you for your recent Conrad Chicago stay and taking time to write about your experience. I'm glad you were able to enjoy the little amenities and service perks that we offer to our guests to ensure that they have a comfortable stay. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back. Sincerely, Tod Chambers",Good
"We stayed at this hotel to be closer to the punta gorda airport for an early morning flight. Hotel lobby wasn't impressive, elevator was missing buttons, but the rooms were clean and nice.

"We stayed in the Hyatt House for one night just before Xmas. Easy to get to via the Link and then one stop on the monorail, we had asked for an early check in, and our room was ready on arrival at noon. The room itself was stunning, immaculately clean (as was the rest of the hotel) and well appointed. Location was sensational (50 yards from the Space Needle and Glass Museum) and a 7 Uber down to Pike St Market. Breakfast was fine and checkout easy we left having had an excellent stay.",Good

There is a parking lot outside and inside, but beware of the inside lot if you have an SUV. The vehicle I rented was an Ford Expedition,...MoreAloha elisem980, Thank you for your review!

"Clean, spacious and comfortable. Checking in and out is a breeze. Cute part of Manhattan. Still top notch. We got the King suite. It was worth the extra 10 to have more room. The linens are high quality, too.Thanks for the review Tammy! We're glad you enjoyed our hotel and the newly developed downtown. Between the bakery, local restaurants, and new IMAX theater within walking distance, it's the best place to get a taste of Manhattan. We hope to have you back soon.",Good
"My husband and I stayed at the Beach Retreat during the Christmas holidays in 2015.

Our rooftop terrace is a pleasant retreat after exploring the city, so Im glad you were able to advantage with a bottle of wine.

"Don't let the outside looks fool you! This might be a motel kinda of place but the owners did a fantastic job renovating it to today's standards. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. As we got there late evening, they helped me locate a parking spot within the property. (review of parking to follow so keep reading)We got a 2 queen room and it was much bigger than I expected. There was plenty of room to roam around without feeling cramped. Everything was clean and well appointed: big flat screen TV, microwave and fridge, coffee maker, iron, closet. Beds and pillows were very comfy. There were also TONS of outlets (including usb) to charge all your electronics. Bathroom was just the the best. It is an open tiled bathroom with the most amazing water pressure ever. It felt like getting a massage in the shower! They offered a light breakfast but we didn't try it. Plenty of really good restaurants less than 5 min walk away with a lot of choices (italian, japanese, brunch, veg/vegan, chinese, mexican, you name it.) Although parking is free at this hotel, the parking lot is limited and a bit tight which can be unnerving if you drive a big truck. We were lucky to get the last parking spot on our first night (it looked like they were sold out and parking lot was full) But did I say it was free :) Just park the car and take the bus. There is a bus stop less than 5 minute walk away. It was a 20 min ride to the Wharf and also 15 mins to Golden Gate Bridge Visitor Center.On the down side, it can get noisy as it is just off the street and you can hear cars pass by. It didn't bother us too much though and we still got a good night sleep. If you are light sleeper, just be aware. What a lovely review! Thank you for taking the time to go into so much detail to demonstrate how happy you were. You had the experience that we want to provide for each and every one of our guests! We are delighted that our property was such a wonderful match for your accommodation requirements, and we hope to welcome you back again soon! Best wishes, Hotel Management",Good
"The rooms were good and clean, and so were the bathroom. I wished if they had any refrigerator in the room. Staff was very helpful. The breakfast options were disappointing. No omelettes and they charged 1 for every addition to scrabbled eggs. I had to pay 3 extra to get onions, peppers and tomatoes added to my scrabbled eggs. Except this, the experience was great. I loved the fireplace opposite the reception.Thank you for your kind comments about our great rooms and hotel staff. I am sorry about your experience in the restaurant options. We hope it wont keep you from coming back the next time you are in Seattle!",Good
"Newly refurbished 2 room condo was immaculate and very well appointed. Great view of the snowy mountains and Big Thompson river. The fireplace was terrific after a blustery snowy day, and the bed was super. We will stay here again.",Good
"Even though I've worked for a W property in the past, I had never stayed in one as a guest so I was super excited when we had enough points saved up for a 2 night stay at the W Seattle for our 1st anniversary. Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance. WOW, thank you for sharing about your recent visit 882triciam, we appreciate the opportunity to be part of such a special event! It sounds like you were able to take advantage of our location to check-out everything Seattle has to offer, including some live local music in the Living Room. The team works hard to make sure our guests every need is met and I'll be sure to share this with them.",Good
"The lobby here is on the 20th floor so the views from the bar there are great. We ate dinner here when we stayed and the wait staff was fun, the Amish chicken was heavenly and the wine selection top notch. The only drawback of having the rooms below the lobby and being so close to the Mile, is that it was a little noisy and the window soundproofing wasnt as good as some places Ive stayed, but overall really fun night! Dear Claire, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago and taking your time to write a review of your stay. I am so glad you had a wonderful stay with us, dinner was great and the team took great care of you during your stay. We hope to welcome you back soon.",Good
"My husband and I took our first trip to New Orleans to celebrate our 23rd Wedding Anniversary and we stayed at this hotel. I will not stay anywhere else when I go back to New Orleans.

"This is a well priced hostel, only a couple blocks off Michigan Avenue, The Magnificent Mile, the main shopping district of the city. The Hostel is very modern, feels safe, is clean, with lockers in your room for your stuff, free wi-fi and the beds are comfortable. The bar on the main floor has a great selection of drinks and is very welcoming. The staff are all very friendly, and are willing to help with any questions you may have. A great hub for exploring the major city sites, and restaurants, and is considerably cheaper than getting a single room in any of the major hotels nearby.If you're good with hostels, and their atmosphere, I really cannot recommend anywhere better to stay in Chicago!Hi MattSRob, Thank you for staying with us and for reviewing your stay. I am so glad to hear you loved your Freehand experienced and found our location and value to be excellent.

"I come to San Diego several times a year. This time wanted to try 2 different hotels. Stayed June 21, 2016, Room 319. The check in and check out was a breeze. Everyone I came in contact was very professional and helpful. This stay was a partial ocean view, 2 QN room. I highly recommend if you could afford it, stay in a full ocean view. The partial ocean view means you will be assigned a room on either side of the hotel. From the patio you do get a slight view if you turn one of the chairs and put it right in the corner. If sitting on the other chair you will not be able to see the ocean. Again, did I say it is just a slight ocean view. Being on the side of the hotel it was harder to hear the ocean waves. I would bet that the full ocean view rooms you would definitely hear the waves as these rooms face the boardwalk and beyond that the beach. The patio has 2 chairs and a small end table. It is nice to be able to hang up wet clothes. You can leave your patio door open to feel the nice ocean breeze. I would highly recommend the higher floors so that you can leave your patio door open all night and be secure. As others have commented, this facility is no resort but it is not a motel either. It is perfect for a get away to the beach. The room is modern enough, the beds were comfortable, and a really nice big tiled bathroom. The vanity is inside the bathroom. The shower didn't have the best pressure but it was decent. The shower is big and enclosed in glass. The bathroom has huge thick beach towels to use. Yes the decor in the hallways and the carpet is very outdated but not old or shaggy. The carpet in the room was ok. There is a small fridge to put drinks in. All in all, the room is very comfortable. There is a continental breakfast. (Standard waffle making, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, danishes, yogurts, fruit, hard boiled eggs, and drinks.) There is plenty of room to sit at a table. It was great for us, all the food constantly being restocked. The pool and hot tub were heated and great. Nice relaxing area with lots of pool chairs. What I liked as well is that you can go out the back of the hotel straight to the beach access. In fact, it's just across the boardwalk. There is a life guard station right there. After you day on the sand you can wash off at an outside shower at the hotel. This is so perfectly convenient to wash off the sand from your feet, clothes, and beach toys. Having a room/hotel so close is so convenient for potty breaks if you have kids. You don't have to walk a long distance to find a bathroom. It's just right up to your room. The underground parking was nice as this whole area is always crowded and parking hard to find. There is a price for the parking which all San Diego hotels seem to charge. It is underground and didn't have any problems finding space. You are close to the elevator and can lug all your suitcases easily. There is a Ralph's grocery store and lots of restaurants (fast food and fine dining) within walking distance. So everything is close by. You will need a car if going to Balboa Park, Old Town, etc. I love how practical this place was to bring kids and just had a good time. I will be coning again. Just wished it wasn't so expensive.We really appreciate you taking the time to provide us with this all of this feedback. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the view and overall had a good time with your stay. Thank you for letting us know some areas of opportunity for us to work on, we are always striving to do better and we will take these suggestions very seriously. We hope to welcome you back again soon!",Good
"My husband had a conference and my daughter and I tagged along. We liked it here. They have free freshly baked cookies everyday. Their breakfast is also free and goooood! We really enjoyed our stay here. Plus, it was so very convenient.",Good
"I cannot express enough how much I love this place. I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews, but the price point was perfect so I figured I didn't have anything to lose.As soon as I walked in, I knew I had made the right choice. Sleek and modern decor combined with incredibly friendly service made me feel immediately at ease. I booked the Executive King sized room and requested a room NOT facing Geary so that I could enjoy some quiet time. It's 312 sq feet, which was plenty of space. Yes, the bathroom is small, but I don't require much room. Surprisingly, in spite of others saying the dark grey paint made the rooms dim, my room was incredibly bright (I arrived at 3:00 pm). The bed is quite possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I've been in and the bedding was so soft and luxurious. I felt like I could lay in bed all day.You have to remember that this is a boutique hotel that was beautifully sprung from an old apartment building. So yes, the floors creak, and you can hear people outside your door. If your style lends itself to a traditionally upscale hotel, this may not be the place for you. If you like hip, modern, eccentric styles, Hotel Diva is perfect.Hello Pamcakes1979,Thank you for sharing your experience at Hotel Diva with Trip Advisor. We truly appreciate your kind words. I hope you had the chance to enjoy the complimentary amenities we offer: wifi, busines center, fitness center, tea lounge, Perrier lobby water service and our sake hour from 5 to 7pm.

"It has been awhile since we last stayed a this hotel. We found many upgrades and re-designed spaces. It was stylish, comfortable, with thoughtful touches like power outlets at lobby tables for keeping laptops and cell phones charged. I loved the breakfast burritos! Our room was attractive, spacious, and comfortable. I would prefer softer pillows, but I may be unique (neck issues). We will stay here again!",Good
"The staff was the other best thing about this hotel. They were very friendly and efficient, getting our keys replaced (twice), killing the ants eating my birthday cake and clearing the stopped up toilet.This is an older hotel, but the price is reasonable, it was clean and it has a great location near downtown and a mega shopping center. The rooms have some wear, but were roomy with a bedroom and sitting room. There was also free wi-fi, breakfast, computer room, refrigerator, micro and pool. Parking was 12. per night.Nice place if you're not too picky and can keep a sense of humor.Dear guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your resent stay with us. We are so glad to hear we were able to meet your needs and expectations. looking forward to seeing you back again soon. thank you again for your wonderful comments. )Kind regards,Laura Benson",Good

This Inn had been renovated and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly! Great location in the French Quarters close to everything . I would not book with a booking agency again however! The rooms could have better lighting. Safe in your room for valuables which is always nice.,Good
"Nothing bad to say about this hotel . We were greeted and helped by a very nice receptionist who made us feel welcome. The room was lovely, and the bed were so good! We loved that we got to have our breakfast in the room every day. Location is great, everything is close, but it's just outside the bustle, so it's nice and quiet. Definitely would go here again!",Good
"We stayed for 2 nights. Only issue, the TV was over 20 feet away from place to sit and watch. As two women traveling alone we felt very safe here. The hotel is one block from Old Town and looks out over most of the area. Nicely decorated and landscaped. Pool and hot tub were nice but I would make sure your room was not over that area. Will stay again.",Good
"We rolled into San Fran without pre-booking anything and found this gem. It's not the Hilton, but it was clean, friendly staff and, well, it was clean! Another big plus besides the awesome price was that there was no parking fee, which can be pretty costly. All in all, it's awesome overall value for where you are. Also worth mentioning, not sure if they are supposed to but they let us keep our vehicle in the parking garage for about an extra 5 hours after checkout, very cool!Thank you for staying with us and for your review.",Good

"We stayed 2 nights here in July 2004 and would definitely come back. The price was right, the room was clean and spacious, the breakfast was well above the average we had been having in other motels, it was quiet and the best part was that it was so close to Disneyland. This was an absolute positive for us as we were able to walk to and fro and come back easily for a quick swim to cool off. On our last day our taxi failed to show up, and knowing we would miss our train, one of the staff drove us to the train station himself - excellent service!",Good

Arrangements had been made for us by the wedding party.Check-in was a pleasure....our room was ready early, the staff was so friendly and helpful. Everytime we came downstairs to the lobby someone greeted us...very often by name, asked what we had planned for the day...made suggestions. We felt really comfortable and very welcome. Our room was lovely and the hotel was so centrally located that we were able to walk to the metro and bart or to pick up a local bus. We look forward to returning to this gem of a hotel.",Good

"Comfort Suites Downtown is great. Writing this from the room before checking out.It's in an easy to get to location just off i4. There's a Panera Wendy's only a few steps away for food. Continental breakfast included omelets, corned beef hash, potatoes, blueberry or regular waffles, plus all the fruit, cereal, breads, etc.Room is great. Comfy, clean and roomy. Great bed and pillow. Love all the plugs for laptop and cell phone. Alarm clock radio even plugged into my iPhone and acted as a speaker.There's an outdoor pool and jacuzzi too. I didn't use it, but many people were enjoying it.No complaints here. Would stay here again for sure.Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your stay at our Comfort Suites.

"This hotel is in the middle of all the Bourbon Street , very convenient. Our room was huge and comfortable. It did however need more lighting in the room. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The in house restaurant served very good food. Breakfast were standard fare, basically buffet of scrambledeggs, meat, fruit, cereal and sometimes oatmeal. It was great just to walk out the hotel door and be right in the middle of all the activity!",Good
"We stayed here for the 4th of July weekend and loved the location. We walked everywhere from nearby Chinatown, to Pier 1 all the way to Pier 39 to watch the fireworks. Everything is close by and we recommend Bread and Cocoa next door for breakfast and great coffee. So many restaurants and shops nearby, you will not be disappointed. Also, Bart Montgomery stop is only about two blocks away so transportation from the airport round trip was only about 18 per person. Dear JeremiahP,Thank you for sharing your feedback with us! We are thrilled to hear that you found our location to be convenient for your visit to San Francisco. Our location provides a number of transportation options for our guests to get about our city without having to get in a car. Guests are also within walking distance of a number of highly rated restaurants and bars for all tastes.

"The hotel is very nice. People are very willing to help with whatever you need. Restaurant on the main floor is actually food in the bar. Expensive and nothing to write home about. The breakfast buffet is now 26/person which is exorbitant, in my opinion. At 200+ per night they should include breakfast.Thank you for your visit and input. I am delighted you found the hotel nice and our staff very willing to assist. We pride ourselves on our service levels so I am happy we did not disappoint.

The loveliest thing about this hotel is the very helpful guys who work at the door of the hotel. They know the area so well. Our room was lovely large clean and quiet. Very close to chinatown restaurants and shops. Hop on hop off bus is just around the corner also. Booking in and out was very efficient and desk staff great.,Good
"This hotel was clean, quiet, and very comfortable. Room was spacious, beds comfortable. Staff very friendly and helpful. A little farther from the freeway road noise than the other options, and price was better, too. Good location, near shops and services, WalMart. Very good breakfast. Will return and choose this hotel again.",Good
"We stayed at the Hyatt House for five days at the end of June, a scant two weeks after the hotel opened. It is located on Fifth street and fronts Seattle Center.Room: The room was well designed. It is designed for longer stays and thus has some basic utensils, cook top and dishwasher. We didn't do any cooking but it was convenient to have a freezer compartment that actually worked. We availed ourselves of some ice cream from downstairs and kept the remainder in the freezer for the next night. The bed was very comfortable, better than most hotels. The shower was large. We saw some electronic controls on the wall that simply said My. It turned out that they were for the electric blind controls on the windows. It seemed to us that travelers shouldn't have to guess what controls in a room do. They should be labeled. This is a small complaint for a room that otherwise was well designed and quiet. We slept well here.Internet: I tested the up and download speeds and got 33 megs down and almost the same speed for upload. Very good internet function and was easy to logon.Housekeeping: We did not get any housekeeping one night and on another a harried housekeeper who was supposed to get off at 4 PM knocked on our door at 830 PM and asked if we needed service. They seem to be short of housekeepers and it struck us that they are asking the housekeepers to do too much. I suspect that they are not paid enough either. Morning Breakfast: The breakfast was quite good. We often stay at the Hampton Inn down the street and the food here was much better quality. You even get real scrambled eggs here versus egg food. The juices were good and cold. They have an innovative cooling table that all of the juices sit on and it worked well. The design of the eating area could be improved. Sadly, now that this hotel is open it will be unlikely that changes will be made. They store the plates overhead in the middle of the buffet line. It is an awkward place to have them and would be difficult to access for shorter customers. The buffet line area is too narrow. When people are on the omelet side they often bump into the people on the other side. This seems like an odd oversight. You would think architects for Hyatt would have this down by now. Overall though, the food was quite good and included in the price of the room.Hotel design: The main lobby area is quite pleasing to look at and use. There are ample chairs with modern design and were quite comfortable. The check in desk was ok but I often wonder why they make their staff stand all day. Hyatt could take a cue from Hilton hotels in this regard. The snack kiosk next to the check in desk was well stocked and we used it several times. The hotel elevators are inadequate. They only have two elevators. There often were lengthy waits, particularly on the weekend when the hotel was fully booked. This is another flaw that can't be remedied and it is a surprise again that the architect failed so badly on this item. There is only one elevator that goes to the parking garage, the one on the left, again a miss. The garage is oddly designed, probably because the hotel is on a triangularly shaped lot. Even though we had a compact car, the parking spaces are far too narrow making it difficult for parking and getting in and out of your vehicle. You also have to make a 90 degree turn to either enter or exit the garage, This is after you descend the steep entry. There are some large bolts protruding from the card reader mount at the bottom of the garage entrance. Since you have to make a sharp turn on leaving I can see that someone with a larger vehicle may run over one of these and puncture a tire. Fortunately for Seattle, it snows infrequently, but I could see where some blowing snow could drift down into the very steep parking garage entrance. Someone entering could then slide all the way to the bottom where they would hit the roll up door.Staff: The staff were pleasant and helpful. They looked fatigued and understaffed. I suspect this will improve as the bring more employees on board. We saw one manager who was on duty all day and was there at least until 10 PM when we walked through the lobby. He was there again the next morning when I left the hotel at 0800.Miscellaneous: They accept dogs here. There is a 75 charge per stay. This seems steep if you only stay for one night. We had no problems with our golden retriever and it was conveniently close to the Seattle Center for dog bathroom breaks. Pickup bags are available on the street. Summary: We would likely stay here again when we visit Seattle. I suspect the start up problems will be resolved soon. The morning breakfast was quite good but they need to resort things so that access is better. The rooms overall were great, well designed and comfortable. The staff are harried, hopefully they will have an adequate number of employees soon. The hotels in Seattle seem very highly priced. Our room was 254 and I see now that the rate has risen to 400 per night. Enjoy your stay in Seattle, this is a hotel you would be very comfortable staying at!Dear Thomas K,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your visit on TripAdvisor.

"I do quite a bit of travelling and this has to be one of the best value one can get for Seattle. Perfect for families or extended business travel. An excellent staff that aims to please, a downtown location, extra large rooms, and the better than average breakfast....you can't go wrong.Staff. Each and everyone sent their best with a greeting: all the valets, each and every front desk clerk, 2 house persons, and the breakfast staff. Service is top notch and this means management is doing a great job.Large Rooms. The suite had an extra large living room with a sofa that can seat four. A small kitchenette was equipped with a frig and a microwave oven. The bathroom set up was convenient as the sink is outside the bath for functionality. The queen bed was firm and I had the best sleep of the entire week. It is downtown so you have the usual downtown noise but I did not find it bothersome.Downtown location. Convenient freeway access. It is literally a turn and a stop light away from the on ramp to I-5. Across the street was a Subway restaurant and 24 Hour Fitness. Across the corner was a good size Starbucks. Within 5 to 10 minute walk are your downtown selection of cafes, thai food, pizza places and more.Breakfast. I think this property offered just little bit more than the competition when it came to selection. You have 2 types of scrambled eggs, 3 types of meat (Canadian bacon, sausage, and ham), a wider selection of pastries, a few types of breads, oatmeal and cereal, multi juice dispenser, jams/jellies. I was also able to build a cold sandwich with ham and 2 different kinds of cheese. You can also make your peanut butter or nutella sandwich. The staff also bused and cleaned the table after each patron.Fitness facility. There was a pool but I didn't see anyone using it. I saw the staff maintained it daily. The gym was smallish but adequate. It had 2 treadmills, one elliptical, good selection of weights, a weight bench, towels, exercise mat, and a water fountain.Other amenities. Bath amenities were Paul Mitchell. WiFi was strong in the room, lobby and restaurant. You had 2 desktops for internet or printing boarding passes. I appreciated the lobby offerings of coffee, tea, and infused water dispenser.Cons. Some nuances: it is a bit dated but still well maintained. The WiFi seemed to drop off while I was at the Gym. I did not see an exercise ball. I can see where some folks may have issues with the noise being close to the freeway and downtown. I didn't have this issue but perhaps one can ask for earplugs. I was in Astoria, Oregon where the seals nearby bothered some guests and the hotel offered earplugs.I think this Springhill Suite by Marriott is definitely the best value one can score in downtown Seattle. I would highly recommend and definitely will return given a chance.Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your visit! We're thrilled you enjoyed everything form the large suites to all of our many amenities. You can always count on us for friendly and attentive service -- our mission is to do whatever we can to ensure you have a comfortable stay.

"A friend and I stayed here for the first time over Labor Day weekend, and were impressed. We were running in the Disneyland Half Marathon early Sunday morning, and we requested a 2nd floor room away from the road so we could go to bed early without being disturbed, and that's exactly what we got at check in. The rooms were very nice and clean, and the beds were sooo comfortable. Additionally, they were very accommodating of our weird schedules. On the day we left, my friend had a late flight, and they not only permitted us to check out an hour late, but gave us new key cards with pool-only access so we could swim and sit by the pool until it was time to leave. We will definitely go back, as we've decided that this is the perfect race-weekend hotel.We are so pleased to read you enjoyed your stay. We hope that we see you again next year for the next marathon. We thank you for your patronage.",Good
"We love staying here as the location is fantastic. Very laid back with a good vibe. We stayed 7 nights and loved our room. The only issue that didn't make it a five star stay was that the WiFi was down for 3 days. This made it difficult to book restaurants, check our flights and generally keep in touch. The hotel seemed lost over the issue and didn't communicate the problem to their guests. The staff were efficient and friendly and we can't wait to go backThank you for taking the time to share your experience staying at the Outrigger Reef Waikiki Beach Resort and for the high recommendation. I am glad that you had a great stay. Please accept my sincere apology for the lack of service.

"Great location to stay pre-cruise if you want to visit Seattle. It is directly across the street from the Space Needle, Science Museum, EMP, and an easy walk to Pikes Market, as well as parks along the water for running or walking (to get some exercise we actually walked to Pier 91 which was our cruise terminal). We had a spacious 1 Bedroom Unit (with bedroom door that closes versus the smaller suite that just has a dividing wall and is a bit cramped) w/pullout couch, 2 queens, large well lit bathroom, full kitchen with stove, full size fridge, and microwave. The large unit also has a full living room and a kitchen table that doubles as a desk with plenty of outlets. The beds were comfortable and the suite had 3 TVs (bedroom, living room, kitchen). The small suite (which we did not have but my sister did) has a much smaller kitchen with mini fridge in the kitchen table and only 1 TV that swivels between the bedroom and living room. The beds were comfortable. Good security in that you need your room key to access any of the floors with rooms. A breakfast buffet is included with a pretty good selection. My favorite part was the Omelette station. As soon as you enter the breakfast area, fill out the order sheet indicating what you want on your omelette, and the cook will make it up exactly as ordered. I had this two days in a row and they were delicious. The omelettes are a bit small, but really the perfect size. They also had a great selection of name brand cereal and fresh fruit (among other items). The hotel also arranged car service for us (it is with Ace Transportation...which is not the same as the one online). It was 70 plus tip. The service call you when the plane lands and tell you to call them when you get your luggage. We then waited about 15 minutes for the driver to pick us up. I'm not sure what the taxi's are like, but that option may be easier without the wait. We arranged for the car service in advance since we had 5 people and 5 suitcases...and it was nice having a large clean SUV. The hotel also arranged for us to have Ace shuttle us to Pier 91 for 8 per person. We thought this would be the same type of service but it wasn't. This was an actual shuttle van that we shared with another family. When we checked out at 12:00 we were expecting it to be there waiting for us (due to our prior arrangement) but the front desk had to call and check on it. We probably waited about 15 minutes for them to show up...but the pier is close (2-3 miles) so not a big deal. Due to all the intersections it took about 15-20 minutes to get there. The Hyatt also has a free shuttle within a mile (to and from) of the hotel. They will come when you request it - be sure to tip if you use that service.Other nice items: all staff were very friendly, Walgreens is close-by for snacks and sodas and any forgotten items, monorail is close by, coin operated washer / dryer, free wifi, neighborhood has lots of small restaurants around.Minor items that would be nice if they had (but they don't): More hooks in the bathroom to hang towels in so that you can more easily reuse them, a makeup mirror, a safe for locking up laptops, ipads, etc. (if you need a safe you have to go to the front desk).Dear Brenda S,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories and made the most of our amenities in our beautiful hotel and city.

This is my first stay in Chicago. the location was within walking distance to most things I wanted to visit. The front desk staff is great and willing to answer any questions.

We stopped at this comfort inn because it was convenient to our route to get back home to Florida. We were puzzled why there was so many hotels in this town. It is in the middle of nowhere.

"I visited with my husband and 16 yr old daughter and best friend and her family. We each got suites with a view before an Alaska cruise. The rooms are clean, large and well decorated-exceeded all expectations. The breakfast is good. Not fantastic but a nice way to start the day. The super bar is friendly and reasonable-we did not try the food. The location is excellent-Seattle is such a good walking city (this was our first time)- its walking distance from most places and still in a pretty quiet spot. Our room had a view of the Space Needle. What makes this hotel exceptional is the staff. The people were simply fantastic-truly customer focused and just plain kind. We had booked the rooms nine months in advance at a 40 discount from the current rate . We were meeting other friends (mom and two teens) that had booked air bnb. By 11 pm they still had not been able to reach their host and were threatening sleeping in their car. Because we had a suite that sleeps six, I asked them to stay in our room. I went to the front desk to explain the situation, ask for bedding -credit card in hand. They were wonderful. They saw how desperate we were, chuckled and smiled and asked what kind of bedding we needed and waved away my card (hope I am not getting anyone in trouble). The bedding was there in 10 min. Ive never experienced such warm hospitality and I am truly grateful. Thanks for a memorable and wonderful visit!",Good
"Great location and price. Walking distance to the casino, cafe du monde, the oyster festival, etc. it was extremely hot outside w real feel of 104 but our room was always cool and comfortable.

"I stayed here for 2 nights before a conference in San Diego while I explored the city on my own. Location is perfection, right in the heart of the Gaslamp district.

"I used this hotel for an event we were having and Heather Gordon was amazing! She helped me coordinate 30 rooms and make sure that everybody had what they needed. The location was perfect since it was close enough to Gaslamp and Petco Park. Everyone enjoyed their stay and I enjoyed how easy it was to coordinate accommodations for 30 people.

"My girlfriend and I decided to go to San Francisco, and after some investigation into the matter, we settled upon the Kensington Park. We tend to stay at hotels that are fairly priced for their location, such as Bill's in Vegas. I'm not a fan of super splurging on hotels, but then again, I'm not going to save a few bucks if it puts us in a rather unpleasant area. After our stay, I have to say it is 99.9 positive with only a few minor issues.Located just off the main intersection of Powell and Post, Kensington Park is in a great location. If you're a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, as my girlfriend is, you will absolutely adore this area of town, as the restaurant is on top of a Macy's building no more than 5 minutes walk away. There are many other restaurants within that area, and there is little doubt that if you do not find anything within the immediate area, you can find something just a few blocks away. The hotel is also a few minutes walk from many posh boutiques, Chinatown, the Financial District, as well as the famous Cable Cars. Public transit is also very accessible from this location, with Geary and Market St within walking distance as well, and was a very good base of operations for the time we spent in San Francisco, as we were mainly focusing on the Northern areas of the city (Bay/Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Chinatown, Japantown, Legion of Honor, Fisherman's Wharf, and Alcatraz).Getting to the hotel was a breeze. We simply (well, simply after finding the station) hopped on the BART, got off at Powell, and headed North to Post St. Due to the popularity of the area however, actually navigating Powell and making it up the hill with luggage in tow can be a bit of a challenge. I can't even begin to imagine the difficulties one would encounter should they have children along with them as well. It should also be noted that there are several homeless people along this route. However, they do not do anything that would cause a nuisance or disturb the peace.Once we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a very luxurious, old school classy, dark coloured lobby, completed with a piano, and several comfortable couches. Once check in was completed, we went to our room which was furnished with your typical hotel items, minus a fridge and cooking implements. Most important of all, the room was clean, which is something that is of importance to most people. In terms of the bed, it's difficult to quantify the level of comfort, as this is a person to person thing. I will say that the bed is a bit on the soft side, which may or may not be to your liking.Naturally, being in such a great city, we didn't spend much time in the hotel room, other than to sleep at night. Each time we came back, the rooms were tidied professionally, with any minor messes we made taken care of. The front desk staff were equally friendly and approachable, and were accommodating to the strange requests that I made of them. One final item of note is that light sleepers may want a room away from Post St, or perhaps consider a hotel not in this area at all. As luck would have it, Post is a one-way street, and just up the street is a San Francisco Fire Department depot, and because of our room, we could hear/see the trucks whiz by every single night. Despite being 7 floors up, there is still quite a lot of noise. Similarly, I'm guessing there is a Police Department or something in the area, as we heard those noises every night as well.All this boils down to the bottom line: would I stay here againIf the rating didn't quite spell it out for you, the answer is yes, assuming I'm doing stuff in this part of town, and I don't want to rent a car. Given the prices of all the other hotels in this area, Kensington Park offers one of the best combinations of location and price around.",Good

I went to this hotel for Father's Day weekend and I will definitely be back. It's away from the Duval action for some peace and quiet but close enough to get back and forth easily. Front desk staff were very hospitable and check in quick. The room I had was a king and quite small but served its purpose. Best of all if you're traveling with children there's a nice fridge and microwave. The room cleanliness was a B+ if you're extra picky. The breakfast was very good and had a nice variety. Nice pool too with free cabanas and a bar. There's free WiFi and covered parking. Overall you won't find better value than this.Thanks for your comments. I am glad you will be back. We love return guests. There is so much to explore and enjoy on the Island you can never see it all. Thanks for staying with us.,Good
"This is really a combination business and couples review. I was in SF for a business conference, accompanied by my husband and another couple. The Galleria Park was a few blocks from my conference, but the rooms cost less than half of what the cost would have been at the conference hotel, plus we had free wireless internet access. Each couple had a king bed room size was urban but ample, with an easy chair and a nice bathroom. We loved the unique decor and especially enjoyed the roof garden terrace. Location near Union Square was perfect for where I needed to be and for accessing public transportation to anywhere else in the city. The wine receptions were a nice touch. Breakfast on premises was expensive, but a good coffee shop is right next door. The staff was great. Highly recommend and would definitely return!",Good

"The Hampton Inn in downtown New Orleans far exceeded my expectations. My friends and I stayed for 4 nights. The front desk staff were all friendly and helpful. Free bottles of water and snacks were given to us upon arrival. Our luggage was held until our room was ready. The rooms we were in on the 12th floor, 1203 and 1204 were spacious, clean and quiet. There was a fridge, microwave and coffeemaker in the rooms and free Wi-Fi. We did not hear street noise or other guests in the rooms next to us. There isn't much of a view except buildings, but we were out and about most of the time anyway. The breakfast buffet on the 4th floor was very good with more than enough hot and cold food choices. You can also get a breakfast to go bag if you're in a hurry. Free bottles of water and cookies were available daily from the front desk. The hotel is an easy 2 block walk to Bourbon St. It's also very close to the street car stops. Overall, an excellent stay!!Thank you for staying with us and your great review on the hotel.

"While in San Diego for a water polo tournament, our son's club secured a block of rooms at the Springhill Suites for parents at 209 per night (including breakfast) + 20 per night parking. Normally we are not big fans of the hotels the club selects (because the choice is most often based solely on the lowest price available) this time, however, we were beyond pleased. The hotel is relatively new and exceptionally clean, and every staff member with whom we interacted was courteous and efficient, especially so at check in. Additionally, there were many large parking spaces in the hotel's parking structure that made it a ding-free experience for our car.Our room was modern and spacious (a very comfortable kingsize bed, a large sofa, a work desk, a large flatscreen TV, a dorm-size refrigerator, a microwave, and an air conditioner that, by choice, made the room meat locker cold......sooooo good). There was also free Wi-Fi that was relatively fast and many easily accessible electrical outlets to charge our phones, and other devices. Another plus for the hotel lies in the fact that it is located within easy walking distance of many very good restaurants and the train station. Plus, for those who would like to leave the car at home and Amtrak in from Orange or LA Counties, it would be easy to do.Over all, we were very please with our experience at the Springhill Suites San Diego Bayfront.",Good

"We stayed at this hotel since the convention we were going to was taking place at the hotel.All of the staff were extremely nice. The rooms were fine and the beds very comfortable.They have a small indoor pool, which I enjoyed early in the morning when it was empty. Though I didn't use the rest of the spa, it seemed to be clean and well equipped.The only thing that really bothered me is how they nickle and dimed you. 14.95 for internet (which we were lucky to get free as part of the convention rate) and 5 for a bottle of water that is out on the table with an invitation to refresh yourself... That said, when I checked in, the front desk offered me a cold drink, which was a nice touch.I am glad you enjoyed your visit at the Waverly and appreciate the feedback. We continue to monitor the pricing of amenities such as internet and water to ensure we remain competitve and will adjust as necessary. Thank you again for sharing your experience with us!",Good
"We spent 3 nights (24.10.11 to 26.10.11) at this hotel as part of a whirlwind city break. It was difficult to find a hotel in New York that could accomodate 2 families of 4 in 2 rooms within our tight budget, but this place fitted the bill. The rooms were not huge but there was space sufficient for 4 individuals per room and the beds were very comfortable.The service from all members of staff was first class at all times and the General manager (Frank Cortese) was exceptionally helpful beforehand, giving us advice by email of the best way to see the city.The location is ideal for Times Square and other places of interest and we'd definitely use this hotel again. Breakfast was included although the eating area is small. There being only 2 lifts to cater for 30-odd floors is a bit of a drawback if you happen to be above the 6th floor, but we only experienced a problem on 1 occasion and it wasn't the end of the world.",Good

"The hotel grounds were beautiful, they seemed to have quite a Mexican/ Spanish influence. The room itself was a bit tired but we were expecting this having seen photos. The air con was powerful but noisy. The pool was small but good for a city hotel and never too busy (we used it a fair amount). The hotel is huge though so I feel they were not at full occupancy. Location was excellent- just across the road from the old town. It was also a 10 minute walk from the trolley/ tram system which easily could take you to the centre of town, 5 for a day pass. We arrived at 10am and they were able to give us a room at midday which was nice. We were in block 8 which was just above the carpark. While convenient, most of the other blocks were in much nicer locations, some rooms with views. I dont know if they were different price as Im sure we had the cheapest option. At check in we were given some 20 off vouchers for the hotel restaurant and a free drink voucher which we used once and was quite nice.Thank you for taking the time to sharing your experience with us!Sounds like you had a great summer getaway.

"The hotel is 2miles from the airport, and as as stop over hotel it is excellent. There are 6 floors and we were give a harbour view room. The room was very clean, spacious with a small balcony that you could sit out on and watch the activity in the harbour. When we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful, and there were free freshly cooked cookies and coffee in the foyer . There were 2 restaurants virtually opposite the hotel, however, they were pricey, probably due to their location. There were several cheap and cheerful restaurants that were within a very short distance at the back of the hotel, which we walked to. The only downside is it was quite noisy from the road. On our last night there were road repairs going on all night, which were particularly noisy as they were using a pneumatic drill.

"This hotel is a great value if you're looking for somewhere to stay near Union Square without breaking the bank. It's a quick walk to the Square, 10-15 minutes to Chinatown or Market Street, and another 25-30 minutes to the Piers. The rooms were comfortable and well furnished. The lobby also provided ice water and tea 24 hours a day, which is a nice touch when you're coming in from a day of sightseeing and need a quick refreshment.The complaints I had:1. The valet service took longer than expected - expect about 30 minutes for your car to arrive from when you request it.2. We stayed in a room that was directly adjacent to another room, and the doors can slam quite loudly. Late at night/early morning this was a disturbance.",Good

Stayed the night recently and enjoyed the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. The room was very quiet despite being on the I-4 side of the building. I was very impressed that I couldn't hear the cars/trucks going by at any time while in my room. Had a problem with the TV which turned out to be an old battery which the staff dealt in a timely manner. The staff was very friendly. The one negative was the free breakfast. This is more an indictment on the the guests than the hotel as the meal was simply mayhem. The staff couldn't keep up with the number of people eating. It always bothers me when people don't clean up after themselves. I would definitely stay here again but will most likely eat else where,Good

"We visited new york for 5 nights in December, Holiday Inn was the perfect place to stay. Convenient for Times Square, shopping etc It was my birthday during our visit and when we got to our room there was a birthday card, chocolates and a cup with sweets (very nice touch). The room was spacious and comfortable, plenty of wardrobe, cupboard space, decent size bathroom with bath and shower, constant hot water. The room was cleaned every day and they replenished our stock of hair shampoo, conditioner, body cream and soap, left fresh towels and if we wanted they would have changed our bedding every day. Coffee machine in room. Breakfast every morning, omlette, sausage, bacon, hard boiled eggs, pastries, fresh pancakes, fruit, cereals, yoghurts, toast, juices, tea and coffee.Staff were very helpful, breakfast room opened at 6.30am (weekdays) and because we had an early start one day (going on a trip) they let us in to eat our breakfast before 6.30am. There was also hot chocolate available in the foyer, after a long day out in the cold, with aching feet, this was very enjoyable. The staff are very helpful and friendly. On our first morning, after a shower, we realised the hairdryer didn't work, i rang reception and within 15 mins there was a man fitting a new one. We were on the 27th floor with a a city view which included Empire State Building. Very quiet hotel, never heard our neighbours. There is an irish pub a few doors away which is worth a visit on your way back to the hotel.I read the reviews prior to staying at this hotel, when we were there it wasn't noisy, there didn't seem to be groups of young singles, if there was they weren't noisy. It seems a very family friendly hotel. We will be returning to NY and would definately stay at this hotel again.Dear Pat B,Wow! Thank you for this fantastic review.

"On a recent business trip to New Orleans, I was able to extend my stay for an evening and in doing so, I chose to stay closer to the French Quarter (the host hotel was near the Superdome, about 1 mile away). The hotel structure itself dates to the 1800's as the very knowledgeable front desk clear explained when I inquired. She knew all the details and was very proud to share her knowledge. It certainly made for a very nice welcome at check-in (which was efficient and quick).After quickly settling in, I was off to explore the French Quarter and the hotel location on the edge of the historic district makes walking to everything quite easy, yet it's just far enough away from the nightlife to keep things quiet at night. Shops, restaurants, bars and historic sites are all around and across the street Louis Armstrong Park can be accessed a few blocks away.My room on the 2nd floor overlooked the lovely courtyard with trees, chairs to relax and an out door pool. The room was fresh and clean with comfortable beds, a pleasant bathroom with ample lighting, free Wi-Fi (easy to connect and fast speed), a refrigerator, HDTV and safe (large enough for my 14 laptop). The only item needing attention in my room was the grout in the shower, which must be a challenge in such a humid climate.Considering this is such a historic property, they have done a nice job connecting all the buildings and keeping the guest room modern yet with old world charm. Rooms face the courtyard, nearby buildings, the street - so be sure to request the view / area that most suits your needs.Although I did not take advantage of the pool, I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast in the morning. A nice mix of hot and cold options, including waffles, eggs, yogurt, cereal, etc. The staff were ever present and helpful to guests, a very positive experience. My only complaint was the oatmeal was only available using the instant packets, which is never as good as a nice hot crock often found at hotels today.In the evening, the hotel also opens the breakfast area for food and drinks, but I explored the area instead. The hotel lends itself to a relaxing escape, and I ended up meeting a couple who are regulars to the hotel and New Orleans! The best guest is a repeat one and that certainly speaks to the quality experience.While the focus appears to be leisure travelers, the hotel has everything required for a business traveler as well. If returning to New Orleans, I would certainly return again and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, affordable hotel with nice amenities. For meeting all my needs and the expectations of a Best Western Plus hotel, I would certainly rate my experience 5 stars.We are glad that we were able to be a nice break from your business trip and hope to see you again the next time you are in New Orleans.Thank You, Bryant Faul - General Manager",Good
This hotel appears to be pretty new. My room was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with everything I needed to make food for the 4 days I was at Disneyland. The only problem I had was with the palm tree outside...More,Good
"I have consulted TripAdvisor many times but this is the first time I have written a review. That tells you how amazing this place is. I have been to La Jolla many times and it was such a delight to discover this gem. In fact, I had booked at the Grand Mar, but had checked both properties out when I arrived in San Diego and decided to cancel reservations at the much pricier Grand Mar to stay here. In addition to the charm and intimate setting, the valet, Chris, sealed the deal. He was the epitome of the California surfer dude - blond, easygoing and down-to-earth yet professional and efficient. He kindly offered to park my car temporarily while I checked out the property and was so friendly and welcoming whereas the valet at the Grand Del Mar just motioned me to the guest parking which was at considerable distance.Loved the room, property, dining and the pool/hot tub. It was hard to leave the resort which is quite the endorsement as I LOVE La Jolla village. The only slight snag is that the lovely outdoor restaurant there, Mustangs, was suddenly closed when a pre-booked conference had to move indoors due to bad weather. It was frustrating because we decided to have another romantic meal there on our last evening only to discover when we arrived that it was not open to hotel guests. The other restaurant, Adobe, was open. And while that is equally good and has a lovely indoor ambiance, we really wanted the charm of the outdoor fireplace at Mustangs. The front desk did what they could to see if they would serve us and when they found out that they still couldn't accommodate us booked a last minute reservation for us at my all-time favorite restaurant in La Jolla, George's at the Cove. The only glitch with that was the front desk informed us that the outdoor terrace (which was our preference) was closed but when we arrived we learned it was open. So it all worked out in the end.Again, that was a small disappointment in an otherwise impeccable stay at Estancia. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's quite simply the loveliest place to stay in the San Diego area and incredible value for this type of property. More than that, it is now one of my favorite all-time hotels (and I've stayed at several beautiful Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton resorts).",Good
"The best part about staying in the hotel is that you are made to feel welcomed by the staff. From the reservation experience to checking in, to asking random questions, the staff made me feel immediately like I was part of the family . The hotel has the basic amenities of Fairfield Marriott. However, I would choose to come here and recommend others come here because of the quality of service given!",Good
"What an awesome place to stay. The location was fantastic. The staff were incredibly friendly. The place was so rustic and authentic. I loved it. It was everything I hoped for in a hotel in the French quarter. The only downside was the little things that didn't work. In room 209 our TV didn't work, our coffee machine didn't work and our door was hanging off its hinges so hard to close. But too be honest, I enjoyed it either way. Thank so much for providing your feedback - we are happy to hear that our staff was accommodating during your visit! Sorry to learn of the difficulties you experienced. Please know that your comments have been shared with management and deficiencies will be remedied. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon!",Good
"We loved our stay at the Ocean Park Inn. We had an ocean front room, and the beach was a few short steps off the boardwalk that ran behind the Inn. Great views of the beach and the ocean. Many amazing restaurants were within walking distance on the boardwalk. We were a little hesitant about staying here based on some of the reviews, but could not have been happier. The staff was so helpful, giving many recommendations for great places to eat, and things to do while we were staying in San Diego. Pat was especially helpful at check-in and throughout our stay. The carpet was a little worn, but the hotel was very, very clean. The bathrooms have been remolded, and were great. Breakfast had a lot of options, and we never went away hungry. There were folks sleeping on the grounds and around the boardwalk, but not one of them approached us, or bothered us in any way. We felt completely safe out walking, even late at night. There is a bar/restaurant on the front side of the Inn, which was loud at night, but we could not hear any of that noise from our room. There was some noise at night from the boardwalk, (skateboarders, people talking) but the location outweighed any nighttime noise. Definitely request an ocean front room. We moved into the city for the last two days of our stay to be nearer the stadium. We missed the OPI and wished we had not moved to the other hotel (which was a great place, just not the OPI). When we return to San Diego, we will definitely stay at the OPI!Thank you so much for all of your wonderful feedback! We are so glad that you enjoyed breakfast and those wonderful ocean views. We also appreciate your kind recognition of our hard working employees. We are so glad to hear that you will be returning to stay with us, we look forward to welcoming you back!",Good

"the room was good, smelt very strongly of bleach when we first arrived, but I guess that means they were cleaning!! Loved the location, so convenient to the beach, a lovely walk along the oceanfront to the pier and lots of restaurants and supermarkets close by. Loads of parking,but didn't really need the car once we were there.Thank you, Michael. Your review was very nice and I'm really glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We are in the process of updating our first section of rooms again this fall, so everything should be very fresh. I hope you willl stay with us again.",Good

1st time in San Antonio. Wanted to be near the River Walk. Was a bit of a hike to the Convention Center but manageable.

"My husband and I stayed here in early June where I was attending a college reunion. Full disclosure...I lived next door for six years and am very partial to the neighborhood. That said, the location is near perfect, close to the Public Garden ,the upscale shops on Newbury Street and Copley Place, Trinity Church, Beacon Hill and an easy walk to the Arlington T Station which will get you almost anywhere easily. It is also very convenient to a host of outstanding restaurants. The Club itself is located in a historic Brownstone and therefore offers only a limited number of rooms. the doubles are very large with newly renovated baths the singles are small and share a bath. The rooms have no TV, but do have WiFi. The office staff is outstanding...knowledgeable about Boston and very friendly. They are present only during the day and after hours, guests enter with a code. Breakfast choices are limited, but sufficient and there is amazingly good coffee from a machine. If you are looking for luxury of the Four Seasons variety, this will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for quiet clean accommadations, a bit of Olde Boston and a fabulous residential location, you won't do any better than this. And did I mention that it is a bargain",Good
"The hotel look like a new contruction and is a very nice area. close to restaurants and my work location. Very quiet area in the night not close to any highway, no noise from cars or truck like in other hotels.",Good
"My three night stay was absolutely perfect. The check in process was so easy it seriously took 3 min . The girl that helped me checking in was so friendly and welcoming . I had a long flight and horrible cab ride and this young woman was so refreshing. My room was clean , modern and quiet. The room had a keurig coffee machine which was nice . They have free cold filtered water and bottles on ever floor. My room view was outstanding. Convenient location to all the downtown tourist spots. I will absolutely stay here again because the hotel was nice but Honestly the staff was incredible . Hello katfrog45,We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and found the staff to be friendly and welcoming.

"Very nice hotel and location is excellence for those going to the Disney Parks. My only concern was for the evening social the pasta was very dry. The salad was very good. The room was VERY clean and VERY comfortable! Overall, I had a great experience while staying at this hotel.",Good
"ServiceThe moment we pulled onto the drive of the Estancia, we were greeted in the most welcoming manner by the friendly valet. This set the bar high which every single employee met for our entire two evening stay. This is so rare but when I mean every single employee, I mean it! From housekeeping to front desk to restaurant servers to even the gardeners!SpaThe spa is great with especially lovely out door hot tub areas. My prenatal massage was great 9i dozed!) and my husband, who was apprehensive at first because he's only experienced a few of them, came out super relaxed and happy.PoolThe pool area is nice and saline water a major plus.FoodThe food was fine -- not exceptional like the service. We ate at Adobe and Mustangs and had room service. The one standout dish was a shrimp quesadilla appetizer from Mustangs - so delicious. Everything was was fine - seemed like standard hotel-y food.RoomOur room was nice but not luxurious - thin and surprisingly spartan walls. We had a veranda room which is a bit misleading. The veranda is just the landing area outside the door with a table and chair. It did open up to a very pretty grassy courtyard.LocationSituated in beautiful La Jolla in walking distance to the beach. We walked over to the glider launch area and down an amazing hike to Black's Beach! It's very steep and not for the faint of heart. The beach is popular in the nudist community so fair warning!Biggest ComplaintExtremely challenging to navigate the property. There did not seem to be an obvious simple or quick way to get to the pool/spa area and our parking spot. The different levels was confusing too. We ran into at least two other guests who were wandering around lost and trying to study the little property map at the same time. I think we even walked the perimeter through the parking lot once because it was just easier than trying to find our way through all the corridors. Recommend MORE DIRECTIONAL SIGNAGE. Maybe with accompanying maps that show context of where the guest is in relation to everything else like you are here arrow.All in all, I would definitely book this place and spa again. So relaxing -- wonderful getaway.Thank you for your review! We apologize if the property is confusing with 6 acres of land we can understand your frustration! We do, however, appreciate the time you took to provide your comments and feedback. Your attention to detail is truly outstanding! We hope to see you again soon, and look forward to your return. Congratulations on your little one on the way, and we hope to meet him or her some day too!",Good
"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a girls weekend. It was fabulous! The staff is extremely attentive, service was great and the spa was fantastic! My only criticism is the rooms with the bathroom open to the bedroom is a little strange - not sure if all of the rooms are like that but the two that we had were. It offered little privacy. There also wasn't too much counter space in the bathroom. However, we were there to enjoy each others company so didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room. La Mar restaurant is one of my faves (I frequented the one in San Francisco) - everything is good on that menu. We had dinner and two breakfasts there.And did I mention the spa I had a massage and a facial - the entire experience is wonderful and peaceful and my therapist was great.We also did a yoga class out on the lawn in the morning - if you are an active person, there is a beautiful walking trail/park right outside of the hotel.I would definitely go back to the Mandarin Oriental...at least for the spa!",Good
"Attractive old hotel about 10 minute walk from the French quarter. Lovely internal courtyard. Staff very helpful booking river cruise etc. Room on the small side, quite comfortable BUT no windows. I suppose we could have asked to move but as we didn't spend much time in the room we didn't bother. Parking a bit pricey.",Good

I am delighted you find the Nox Creek Lounge an enjoyable place to visit with friends. Thanks for your loyalty and we will see you again soon.",Good
Disappointed that the hotel charges guests for parking. Check in on the sixth floor. Desk on the first floor is for information to tell you to go to the sixth floor. Breakfast is consistent with the hotel chain. Drink cards in place of cookies is a nice perk.,Good

I stayed here with my wife for three nights and we really enjoyed this Inn. The people who work there are extremely helpful and friendly. Ask Lonnie for recommendations on where to eat.

"On Tuesday, December 10, 2013 I pull in to the Fairfield Inn Marriott in Philadelphia with a flat tire. I was on my way to take my last final for the semester, I walked into the lobby and asked was there anybody to help change a tire. The agent at the count was an angel, and said, sure give me a minute. Then a young man came over to me and introduce himself as John. John said, I'm here to help you with you car, at that point we both walk out to my truck. John, asked if I had a jack or anything else to take a tire off, well I didn't. John with so much patience and great customer service, said Don't worry I'll find one. Then John and Reuben came over as a team and blessed me to get back on the road and on time to school for my final. I am so very thankful and blessed for that experience at the FairField Inn.

"I commend the staff at Drury for achieving some of the highest quality customer service I've experienced. So often employees get jaded, bring their personal lives into work, and/or generally take out their personal problems with others at the workplace. The week we were there we enjoyed smiles and pleasantries every morning from the ladies at breakfast, Rosa (room attendant), and those working the desk. Not to leave out Jonathan, Jeremy, and Brandon, our Valet's. These guys were very pleasant and gave off a great spirit while taking care of our vehicle making sure it was always ready to roll, often on short notice. I witnessed them actually running to provide positive service for us and other guests. All in all everyone we came in contact with were great representatives for this company. I will continue to seek out Drury for our travels. I'm Wardog and I approve this message.",Good

When I checked-in they gave me 2 free bottles of water and they also have complimentary breakfast :) The only reason why i m not giving 5 stars to this hotel is because they don't offer food service to your room, you would think that they offer this type of service :(.

"Had a four night stay at the Cabrillo in early May 2010. The room was extremely clean, so much so that we had to keep the windows open to let the cleaning fragrance escape! I guess you should never complain about a place being too clean. The room included a complimentary hot breakfast but did not include parking. The hotel was a bit away from San Diegos centre but it was definitely within walking distance for us. If not for others, the trolley and bus stop is only a block away. The staff member at the front desk was very helpful with information regarding maps, transport, food and places to steer clear from. The nightly rate was 150USD, maybe a little pricey for what we got but we enjoyed the stay overall. We were there to see San Diego after all, not the four walls of the Best Western. Still, I would recommend this hotel if you didnt mind being just out of the very centre of the city.",Good
"The St. Regis San Fran is a beautiful high-rise property in a great location in one of my favorite cities. The staff was highly-attentive, but never intrusive. The room service was phenommenal and always hot, delicious, and on-time. The beds and high tech window controls were wonderful too. I didn't get a chance to eat at Ame, but I heard wonderful things about the restaurant in the hotel. The bar area was always popular for cocktails and the gym was fantastic. I would highly recommned making reservations at Gary Danko for dinner, one of the best meals I've ever had! Also Boulevard and Postrio were fantastic and R G Lounge has amazing, authentic chinesse food. I also loved Taylor's Refresher along the Embarcadero for fun and delicious diner style food in an open, casual atmosphere.Overall, the St. Regis is the place to stay if you are looking for one of the best hotels in San Fran with luxury, privacy, and amazing service.",Good

We tried to have dinner at the bar (only food service) and they were out of several items on the limited menu. When we did order, it appears that the order was lost in the kitchen. The bartender eventually made it himself--in all, we waited almost an hour for the food. The grilled cheese was made with Kraft singles. Breakfast buffet had various options.",Good

"My wife and I had a fabulous time at the Westin Nanea. The accommodations, staff, concierge, and location exceeded our expectations. The property is conveniently located in north Kaanapali, and is close to the shopping and farmers market of Honokowai.

"I was so pleased when I saw the location and the facilities, however I never knew whether there was a work out room, or what or where any of the amenities were. The front desk people always seemed like they didn't know whether or not to welcome me. We called the front desk one day because the dvd player wasn't working. They didn't send anyone, so I finally went downstairs after thirty minute's to find someone, and it was the doorman that called the maintenance man for me. He came and helped, but could never fix it, so we thought it was our DVD. We spent the last day of our trip traveling back to where we made the purchase, only to find that it was the hotel's dvd player. So we wasted the entire last day of our trip. So I would say that the service was really lacking, but I loved the building and location and price.",Good

"Kinda pricy! But if you want clean and comfortable rooms with a cozy bed, this is the place. Right by the airport and if you get in late TGIF is open late and not too far. If you like to sleep in...well this is the kicker, it gets loud in the hallway. House keeping makes sure they wake everyone up to get you out so they can do their job. It is about 7 miles to Disney stuff. Would stay here again. It is especially gratifying for me as Housekeeping Manager to read that you enjoyed our rooms so much and I can assure you that I have personally spoken with my team regarding the noise level in the hallways. Please accept my apology for not being as considerate as we should have been.

"I booked our room through Expedia and was able to get it for 80+ dollars per night. It was a great price for such a trendy and romantic place to stay!The room and bathroom were not only aesthetically pleasing in design, but had good quality beds, linens, curtains, etc. and were extremely clean. I loved the bathroom with its large mirror, wide bath (the shower was heavenly with strong hot water), and colorful blue tiles on a whitewashed wall that simply says Mediterranean to me.The hotel has a great restaurant we did not get to try out, but it was within short distance of great restaurants and bars, the trolley station, and a CVS on the next block.

"If you need a pristine trendy hotel, with all the amenities, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for clean, comfortable lodging, and can put up with a few items that are rough around the edges, this may be the place for you. At about 70/night this place was about half to a third of some of the more modern places that are literally next door. Our modest sized room was a true suite with a door between the bedroom and the sitting area. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a big, clean bathroom. Staff were efficient and friendly. The breakfast was all we could ask for, and was generally kept well stocked. The breakfast rooms are large with lots of seating. As noted, there were some rough edges: the ventilation fans in our room were quite noisy the screen on our window was broken and the pool elevator was creaky, with a well outdated inspection report posted. The location in the valley is just off of I-8, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. We were able to get most anywhere we wanted to go to see the sights in 10-15 minutes.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your recent stay with us. We appreciate all your wonderful comments. We work very hard to keep our little hotel clean and comfortable and we are aware that it needs a lot of TLC. We are also looking forward to getting a full renovation very soon, We hope to see you back once this is done. )Thank you again for staying with us.Kind regards,Laura Benson",Good

It is not with a lot of other development, as far as shopping malls or tourist endeavors, but right near I-5 and easy access to points of interest from there. It is a clean, quiet motel with pretty much everything you need. It also has a nice breakfast. It doesn't look spectacular from outside (not bad, just not fab), but it is clean and more than adequate.Good Afternoon,Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel.

"We arrived just before Mardi Gras yet had no probelm booking this hotel. Though centrally located, It is a good walk from most areas. The trolley stops just a block away which is nice. Take a ride -- and see how close it comes to parked vehicles. Breakfast is always a treat, though Drury San Antonio had a wider variety of choices. And at 5:30pm it looked like guests actually dine on the wings, baked potatoes, hot dogs and the chili provided in lieu of heading out to dinner. Rouses, an attractive grocery, is nearby for quick fill-ins or paninis made to order or practically anything else food-related. The bed, in my opinion, was a bit soft as were the pillows. I wish they had queen-size beds too. The staff is very accommodating and willing to make suggestions for clubs, restaurants or attractions. The Drury is clean and modern and is currently building an addition which should provide more variety of rooms and maybe even a fancier breakfast. Oh, they even arranged for transportation from the airport.",Good

"We stayed here while attending the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course. It could not have been better. Every staff member we encountered was kind, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful beyond their duties, especially reception staff (Devon). They were kind enough to offer us a shuttle directly to the East Gate of the golf course in both directions, at OUR convenience, which made everything so much more enjoyable. The room was well-appointed and clean, with a very comfortable bed. The amazing spa ... a couples massage room with all the amenities and truly wonderful staff. The only less-than-enjoyable item would be the room service, but it was handled immediately so that I hate to complain at all -- we had a very nice and comfortable stay, and look forward to our next visit.",Good

From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out, every staff member was on top of their game and extremely friendly. The hotel grounds speak for themselves. If you reserve a room on their site, then you've seen the grounds. It's cool, it's chic, it's clean, it's everything that you see in their pictures.

"I first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Seattle soon after it opened about 8-9 years ago. I remember loving the hotel. It was new and modern and in a great location and ever since I've always loved it. I recently revisited it and was worried that it could now be showing its age. I'm happy to report that these worries were completely unfounded, the hotel is still amazing. There's a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, as well as a Starbucks and a sushi restaurant. The staff is very helpful. And the location is great for anything in downtown Seattle, either business or pleasure. But my favorite part of the Grand Hyatt Seattle are the rooms. They are modern and I just love the layout of them. As others have reported, the bathrooms are huge, and the whole entry area of the room has stone floors instead of carpet. The views from the upper floors are also amazing, especially on an unusual clear day. I had room service twice and each time it was good and came quickly. Overall, it's a great hotel. I highly recommend it.",Good

"The room was large with twin queen sized beds. The bathroom was the right size and we had planty of room for relaxing and dining. I have 2 small children and they were very comfortable. To keep them busy, I hooked up my media streamer to the LCD tv and away the kids went with their cartoons. The pool was a nice plus. While not too large, it was plenty for the people that partook. The kids made many friends while at the pool and we had several kids come to our room to invite my kids to come down to the pool. I can't say enough about the breakfast. The days we were at the hotel, the breakfast was amazing. Eggs, bacon, muffins, cereal, jucies, waffles, etc...just about everything that my kids love for breakfast. Different days had different breakfast specials. One day was breakfast sandwiches which were quite good. Another day was breakfast burritos which were also quite good, but there was no salsa. Luckily, we had salsa in the room. Overall, I was very pleased with our stay at this hotel.Thank you for taking time to share your great experience with our hotel.

"I decided to give the San Remo 5 stars because what they do, they do very well. It is absolutely charming, the folks at the desk are very helpful and friendly, and the whole atmosphere is welcoming, homey, with some nice touches. Mini raisin boxes and mini soaps from Chinatown in the rooms lemon water, coffee and tea in the lobby books and guides for your perusal and a fantastic location are all nice features. On the downside, just so you know what you are getting into, the bathrooms and shower rooms don't have a sink so you are washing your hands in the corridor. Speaking of corridors, they are tiny and narrow, and if you have a thoughtless, noisy neighbor who talks loudly, you will not have peace. The rooms are very small. That said, I would absolutely stay here again next time I am in San Francisco. The area around Washington Square is charming, there are some terrific restaurants, including Mama's for breakfast, nearby, and you can walk to the Marina district or SOMA easily.",Good

"After returning from Chicago and a stay at the Hotel Allegro, celebrating my partner's birthday, I can't say enough good things about the hotel. While our check-in was a little rocky with a staff member who was a bit terse ( though solely trying to deal with what seemed to be a security issue), overall our stay was great. Staff even had candies, nuts and beer in the room, with a hand-written card waiting for us in our room, as a birthday gift for my husband. The hotel has recently been updated but stays true to its Theater district roots. Modern Art Deco design adorns throughout, while still giving this hotel an old world classy feeling. However, note standard rooms are smaller than the average sizes today, though you will have just enough space to not feel cramp.",Good

"You will love this mid-century gem! Was attending a conference in San Diego and someone recommended that I eat at the restaurant at the Pearl Hotel. I went online to look up the restaurant menu and fell in love with the hotel pics! Was already booked at the Sheraton (not a big fan of generic chains) but I decided to call the Pearl at the last minute and talked to the ultra fabulous, Avalon! They had a room available and I immediately cancelled my Sheraton reservation. Best decision ever! Stayed in one of the Gem rooms upstairs. Super comfortable room, great retro decor, and super clean! The room had free WIFI that worked great! The Pearl is in a great little residential neighborhood off a main street. I loved the location, which ended up being even closer to my conference location.Went downstairs and had amazing cocktails and full 3-course dinner at the bar. Bartenders were great and Chef Elliott Townsend will not disappoint. The food was DELICIOUS!! Beautiful, seasonal ingredients cooked perfectly! Will absolutely eat here again the next time in San Diego!This is a small hotel and there is no valet parking or luxury amenities. But their service more than makes up for this! They get 5 stars for service for sure! Avalon took care of everything from the moment I called. She took care my room reservation, reserved a parking space, helped with my bags, handled room service, and brought up a hotel t-shirt that I purchased. She even came outside to wait for me when I called the hotel to say I was a little lost! She provided better service than some 5-star hotel concierges I've dealt with. ATTENTION PEARL MANAGEMENT: Chef Elliott and Avalon are rock stars!!",Good
"I stayed at The Estancia La Jolla Hotel Spa for 2 nights while in the San Diego area for business. The property is beautifully landscaped and hotel staff give their best efforts at guest service. I liked the place, and would stay again when in the area.The hotel seems to be primarily geared toward the wedding and event industry. Large group events tend to be the norm, and an attitude of revenue capture over guest experience was evident to me. A nightly Hospitality Service Fee of 17 and a nightly parking fee of 25 are charged on every room category (including suites). In my opinion, the resort could elevate the guest experience a bit by either discreetly handling such fees (i.e. including in the room charge), or to communicate such fees during the reservation process (surprises at check out tend to feel deceptive at the consumer level). Wifi was included in the price of the room, however.The interiors are at the age where they could use a refresh. They are just on the verge of feeling dirty and old. The good news is, they aren't bad enough that every guest would notice.Liked it, would stay again, don't love it as a Destination.Thank you very much for your honest feedback and sharing your photos on Trip Advisor. We are truly very sorry you were not 100 satisfied with your stay. It is with great pleasure that we do indeed welcome many leisure and business guests- as well as meeting and event guests. The Resort Fee is a industry standard and we must remain competitive to this. Again, thank you for your feedback.",Good
"This is such a fun, lovely hotel. The attention to detail is impressive, from the thicker rimmed water glasses to the extra fluffy towels. Loved the vibrant art which lends itself to a hip vibe. My only disappointment was at their restaurant, the Lockbox. The menu is just trying too hard. I am a fairly adventurous eater but each of... More",Good
"My visit to the best Western mission bay was great. Once I arrived the stay was friendly and fast, in addition lead my family to local areas foe food seeing we've never been in the area. The room was clean and the beds were so comfortable it felt like sleeping on a marshmallow. In the morning the breakfast area was pack but I understand why, with the waffle maker eggs bacon cereal biscuits gravy yogurts who wouldn't want to dine in for breakfast there.Good Afternoon,Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.I am happy to see that you were thrilled with our comfortable beds, rooms and breakfast.

"I really liked this hotel. I stayed in town on business and was very pleased with the service of the staff at the front desk who seemed to be very accommodating and hospitable, as were the bell hops and wine servers. The complimentary wine hour each evening was a nice touch and a great way to network and meet fellow guests. Centrally located and within a reasonable distance to the financial district and union square - it was very accessible. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the cleaning staff were very loud in the mornings and begun banging on doors extremely early (around 8am) to begin cleaning. I had to leave my privacy sign up the entire length of my stay. Also our room was right next to the service elevator, which was unfortunate. Also beware, the walls are very thin so you can hear EVERYTHING your neighbors say or do but if you're fairly quiet (which I am), not in the room much (which was my case) and you have quiet neighbors (which I thankfully did) it's not a huge deal.",Good
I really enjoyed my week at the conference center and hotel. The service was good for the most part. Arthur is an amazing service provider and very eager to help patrons have a good experience. I really liked the conference center. The rooms are comfortable and the snacks were good. I'd like to see a little more protein in any and all good that is provided. The bathrooms were nice and the staff very easy to work with. I would recommend anyone to enjoy the conference center for training or event. The parking is decent and cost is a little high.Thank you for taking the time to share details from your recent visit with us. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay but even more thrilled that you shared your experience with the thousands of visitors to Trip Advisor each day.,Good

"This hotel is clean, and reasonable, conveniently located close to downtown, harbor island, airport, and other attractions. It looked like a renovated, upscale motel, and there was a little noise while they were cleaning mid day, but otherwise, good experience and reasonably priced. Avalon at the front desk was especially helpful and informative they also give you complementary coffee and check in/out was easy. I would consider staying here again, unless price and views elsewhere were more appealing. Parking was also easy, free residential available not far from the hotel.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, thank you for your kind review. We appreciate your support.

"We recently stayed for one night at this hotel. We being me, my husband, and 3 of our children, ages 4, 3, and 9 months. The hotel was beautiful and the atmosphere elegant. I was not there at check-in, but it must have gone smoothly since my husband did it alone with all the kids while I was at a meeting and didn't complain!The kids enjoyed the indoor pool. However, the key did not work at first to get into the pool, requiring my husband to trek across the hotel and lobby with everyone in their swimsuits to get a new keycard.The room service was good, but I would have liked more choices, especially on the late night menu. And make sure to ask about a kids entree choices and prices, since they are not printed on the room service menu.Our room on the 14th floor was large and had 2 queen beds, a desk and chair, and a nice lounge chair. There was a good view, too!We got a good AAA rate of 99 a night.The only problem I had was with the billing, but it was fixed. We had to change our reservation to 1 night instead of 2. The bill I got had charged us as a no show for the first night, even though I had changed the reservation online in plenty of time. Also, there was a 9.95 internet fee that we didn't use. Both charges were taken off the bill, but it was still a hastle to have to address it at all.I would stay here again if I could get the same rate. However, I think hotels of this caliber should offer free internet, which draws me to other hotels.",Good
"The rooms are nice and clean. We got a small suite which was more or less a standard hotel room and a half, including a small kitchenette.

"The last time I stayed here was about 20 years ago, this place was a dump. Because of this I was disappointed when it came up on Priceline. I'm a regular Marriott Rewards Elite member but usually stay at Courtyards. This just proves how one bad experience can influence decisions for many years. I was very, very pleasantly surprised when I walked thru the front door. Very attractive lobby, very friendly staff except for one bigger fellow at the front door who kept pushing for valet parking and unloading bags before we were even checked in. No tip for him, but everything was almost perfect from that point on. Very nice, attractive room, good a/c unit, quiet, and well designed. And very comfortable beds, good water pressure, and toiletries. With a walkway directly into Lenox and just across the street from Phipps the location is great. The drawbacks, 20 for self parking. You could probably avoid this by parking in a regular Lenox parking area but then again your car might not be there the next day. You do get in/out for no extra charge. The other negative is 12.95/day for inroom wifi but it does work. Supposedly it if free in public areas. The other drawback is food. The first night we were very tired and ordered room service. Expensive and bad. Too many good places nearby, so look elsewhere. Hope it comes up again. Definitely 4 star.",Good
We have stayed here many times and it's always a comfortable relaxing experience.

"Fantastic hotel with great rooms! Service was good, rooms were clean. The only downside - our room was overlooking the rooftop of a local nightclub so we fell asleep listening to the loud bass from the music. Otherwise great place and would go back again.Dear Mtxstarr,Glad you joined us, although I apologize for the lively neighborhood! There's not too many challenges that arise from a city with such amazing weather, but one of them is that a lot of the bars and restaurants in the Gaslamp are outdoor. That can lead to some issues with noise from time to time! One great room tip ask for a higher room overlooking the East Village (also known as the Ballpark District). There's less noise emanating from the local clubs there. Hope that helps and please come see us again.RobertGeneral ManagerHotel Solamar - a very Kimpton Hotel",Good
"Stayed her two nights before Alaskan cruise. Rooms were really spacious comfortable. Found staff pretty robotic, not too welcoming. Breakfast was very substantial but area very crowded especially on second morning people all over looking for tables. Area not big enough for number of guest. Liked that they had a Coffee/Tea Station just in front of elevators that was always fully stocked. Returned from a long day in the heat after 3pm to find room not made up yet so we had to wait around which was a bit annoying. Staff at front desk did not care or think it was an issue when we brought it to their notice. Shuttle service was goodEve, it was a pleasure having you stay with us prior to your Alaska cruise.

"Our first time staying at the Ocean Park Inn. We have walked by this nice hotel many times while visiting our son in Ca. We usually stay at a resort up the street but decided that since we were only going to be in town for one night let's try and stay on the ocean. What a wonderful surprise! Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom appeared to be newly remodeled and quiet nice. Front desk clerks that checked us in and out went out of their way to make us feel very welcome. Loved the fresh fruit upon checking in. The parking garage under the hotel was a plus! Can't wait to return in the fall for a longer stay.Thank you for your kind words, we are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Ocean Park Inn!

The breakfast was perfect, the free drinks/food at happy hour were a plus, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly!. Our room was very clean, bigger than I expected (just a standard room) and the bathroom had a marble look. The in-room fridge microwave was awesome. We utilized the pool every day and it was very quiet and refreshing. The fitness room contained 2 treadmills 1 bike and a flat screen tv. No weights, but at least there was a place to run off some fun from the night before! The location was a few short blocks to anything and everything! We always opted for the main streets, and never felt scared on any of our walks around town (even at 2am). We will stay here again the next time we visit for sure! Make sure to get a hand grenade at Tropical Isle. 3 will get the job done. Enjoy!!!!!",Good

"We have stayed closer to the seaport village on previous visits to San Diego but this was a great location. We walked to the Midway, the Maritime museum and the Seaport Village along with driving to the Zoo and Legoland. There is also a new park with water feature across from the Maritime museum that was a favorite spot for my 11 year old son. We stayed on the 15th floor. Our room was very nice and quiet but the bathroom has one of those sliding barn doors with a little bit of a gap when closed so not complete privacy. We heard someone complaining about it downstairs. The Wi-Fi worked fine during our 5 day stay. The breakfast was great all the mornings we were there. My son loved the waffles. You need to go down early though since with the size of the hotel, it could get crowded although there are a lot of seating options. The pool on the 5th floor was a little small but it was a great view of the city and water. There was a Starbucks across the street behind the Amtrak station so it was close enough. It is a very new area so I am guessing more food and drink options will be available soon.",Good

"Perfect location for being able to walk to the triathlon venue a half mile away. The staff was nice. Ample, free parking and comfortable room albeit small. Refrigerator and microwave in the room. The pool area was beautiful. Live music at night but was not so loud that I could hear it in my room.",Good
"We stayed here for one night with our 2 young kids. As mentioned in other reviews, some of the suites are quite small, although some of that is probably just due to having a divider in the middle of the two parts. It was nice having a divider between us and the kids, even if it was just a clear door. The one suggestion I would make to improve the property would be to have either clouded glass or curtains over the glass part of the doors so that they're not completely transparent. That way you can still watch TV after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up.While the rooms show some use, the property has been kept up well. The pool was clean and heated and there are some nice areas for eating outside in the perfect San Diego weather. The hotel is about 10 minutes from Sea World, Mission Bay, and downtown,so its a quick jump to everywhere, although the downside is that nowhere is within walking distance. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were very accommodating when we requested a crib for the room and, after we left one of our phone chargers, they went to our room and called us when they had found it. Service like that is what makes this hotel go from just average to very good.Overall, this hotel is a solid choice, as long as you don't mind driving to the local attractions. Also, just as a tip, there's a parking fee for parking in the lot, however, you can park on the steet for free, as long as you can find a spot.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests.

"It doesn't necessarily have the luxurious feel of the Hyatt or Four Seasons, but it is much more practical for a business traveler. The suite-style room is much more spacious than the standard room in a luxury hotel. It had what was essentially a living room (couch, desk, coffee table, mini kitchenette) in addition to the bedroom. Made doing some late-night work more comfortable than slouched in bed.I'm not an extremely light sleeper but street noise will sometimes wake me and even though my room was closest to the highway, I slept like a baby. Comfortable bed and room temperature.I highly value a good shower, and the showerhead at the SpringHill Suites was only so-so (hence the 4 star rating, otherwise it would be a solid 5). It was a bit older, not quite symmetrical water spray / pressure, not terrible but not great.But overall great stay for a business trip.",Good
"This hotel is in a very convenient location. Only 15 minutes to Tulip Town and Roozengaarde. Everything in the Skagit Valley was easy to get to yet still not a lot of congestion in the hotel area.

"From the moment of check-in to check-out, this was a great hotel. My friend picked me up at the airport and then we went to the hotel. Very easy access off the I-5. Check-in was a breeze and the booking was all as requested.We had a King suite and my friend said the sofa bed was comfortable to get a good night's sleep. We had to call the front desk as the sofa did not have any bedding on it - they were in a cupboard and someone came immediately to help us. My bed was comfortable.The cupboard s somewhat smallish but plenty of coat hangers.The bathroom was a good size and functional and it was nice to have a basin/sink in a separate area outside the bathroom. Amenities included separate shampoo and conditioner, as well as soap and body wash. The towels were a good size, but a couple of them had a musty smell - fortunately there were extra towels.But the breakfast - what a wonderful surprise - hot buffet breakfast each morning included with the rate, and coffee constantly available in the lobby.And Wall Street Journal available each morning.We walked everywhere. Yes, there is a shuttle but we did not need to catch it. Walked to Pike Market, Pioneer Place, Space Neede and Lake. Great easy walking. Yes that are some are sow folks who are own on their luck - but this is a downtown city area. Watch yourself. Had someone who was follwing us but this was in the Pioneer Place area.Went on a great tour, Bill Spiedel's Underground tour - highly recommend for the history, and a number of great galleries for North West art.Had booked an early morning wake up call ad a car to take me to the airport. The call did not happen but fortunately I had set my alarm as well, but the car was there which was the mre important issue. Great car service the hotel uses and they take credit cards.I also had room service and recommend the salmon burger - the salmon was great, and the asparagus soup was very tasty. Room service was very prompt and order was as requested.Be aware there s quite a hefty room tax (presumably paid to the city), so it turns a 160 room into over 200 - not the hotel's fault, but be aware as I was surprised by the additional taxes being so high.Overall, a wonderful stay and would stay here again if I came to Seattle.Greetings AussieNarelle!

"Stayed two nights. Felt like they only cater to the rich and famous - that applies mainly to the front desk people and the one female staff member during the Hosted Wine Hour. The housekeeper on my floor, the restaurant gentleman at breakfast, and the valet gentleman were very nice.45.00 per night for valet parking! I realize parking is a premium in Seattle, but Wowie! The only other option is street parking (move it by 8AM) or metered lot across the street. Neither option desirable considering the known car thefts in the area. I hit the restaurant for breakfast only once. Over-priced, fair portions. Friendly gentleman served me. Not many people there at 8:00AM. Ate my protein bar for breakfast the next day instead. The hotel is OLD. The room was updated with modern amenities, including USB ports and plugs for gadgets, flat screen TV, fridge, modern shower fixture, over the sink lighting, free internet.The floor in my room creaked at every step. The room smelled musty. The windows do not block the sound well and one would not latch. Thank goodness for the room darkening curtains and my personal ear plugs! The HVAC was OK - did the job and was not loud. King Sized bed was comfy with lots of pillows. Noisy - The hotel is a couple of blocks from Swedish Hospital and Virginia Mason - hence sirens at various times of the night. Also note it IS in downtown Seattle a few blocks up from I-5.Nice walk in closet. Stocked honor-bar (very pricey! 8.00 for water!) . Save your money, walk 2 blocks up to Bartell Drugs for water and snacks. The bathroom is VERY small. You have to close the door to use the sink. The door will not stay open unless you block it with something. The light from the streets at night are very bright so you have to close the door. Definitely room for only one person. There is no counter space, unless you count the little shelf above the sink. When I mentioned the door at check out, she said we'll check on that. Yeah...right.Dear Neelee, Thank you very much for your honest feedback. At Hotel Sorrento we continue to improve and make upgrades that are meaningful to your Guests, your feedback is being used to prioritize these improvements.

Our check in was quick because being a night auditor I know check in procedures and IHG reward standards. I was happy they gave my request for 2 beds as well as a decent view! The room was super clean. Only minor issue was that there was no garbage bags in the room. I used the laundry bag instead. Great job staff at HIE Times Square. :)Dear taylorma05,5-stars from someone who knows hospitality - wow thank you so much!

And most important it was close to Amtrak, airport, the bay, gas lamp, freeway, Petco Park and a Rite aid to buy your beer. Will visit again.Dear Anthony P, Thank you for staying with us at the Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego. We are pleased to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and want to thank you for taking time to share so many details about your trip. We are happy to have provided you with a location near so much. We look forward to your next visit. Best Regards,Grace GerzenGuest Relations Manager",Good
"The hotel is nice - redone, fresh, and rather nice - both rooms and the physical plant. But the people make this hotel.

"This hotel is situated in the centre of Old Town with very close proximity to restaurants etc. Also 5 minutes walk to the tram station with frequent service to San Diego. This is a very attractive hotel, modern but built in the old Spanish style. Not recommended if you have difficulty with stairs as this is built on multiple levels. Let down a bit by the breakfast as there is very limited choice of hot food, but there are plenty of local cafes for breakfast.",Good
"Hotel was clean, staff put us on the first floor because I was using s cane to walk. Staff was so friendly, even got our luggage and loaded it into our car. Thank you so much. Room was clean. Front desk greeted us every time they saw us",Good
"My partner and I prefer to stay in the vicinity of the urban environment of theLake Eola area when we visit the Orlando area.We had customarily stayed at two charming hotels a block or less from the Lake,but we recently became parents of a French Bulldog puppy and these two propertiesare not pet-friendly. Thus, we needed to find a property in the vicinity that was in ourprice-range.Thank goodness, the Comfort Suites fit that bill perfectly. The service was efficient andfriendly, making excellent recommendations on where to eat in the neighborhood ofIvanhoe. Our suite was extremely comfortable it had adequate space, including botha sofa and desk. The pool was an added benefit. Also, parking was complimentary.We are quite happy to have found a hotel of high quality such as this we intend tomake it our new home as we travel with Chanel, our new puppy!",Good
"We only found this hotel halfway through our stay in La Jolla, and we wish we had found it sooner! A friend and I brought our teenage daughters to La Jolla in search of beach and pool time. The Estancia met all of our expectations. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, clean and well-kept, with a sparkling pool and a relaxing whirlpool. The rooms are pretty too, with newer tile baths and even a complimentary bottle of wine! The resort was so quiet and peaceful, it felt like we had stumbled upon a well-kept secret. The hotel is situated about a 5-10 minute drive from Torry Pines State Preserve, where there is a nice broad beach for swimming and exploring. You can also take a two mile walk to Black Beach, where the surf conditions are epic. I would say the one element of our stay that was less than excellent could be the food. The poolside lunch was pretty average. But our dinner at Mustangs Burros was tastier. We much preferred this location to the hotels right in the village of La Jolla. Estancia felt more like a real getaway. We are already planning our next visit there!Thank you for taking the time to share detailed thoughts from your stay in June 2013. Your 5-star review is much appreciated! We are pleased that you not only enjoyed your overall stay at Estancia La Jolla, but also you got a chance to experience the Torrey Pines Golf Course. Again, thank you for your review. Please come back and visit us again soon!",Good
The Found:Re is a truly unique experience. It is really an art gallery posing as a hotel. Wonderful pieces to view everywhere. I thoroughly enjoyed strolling the property to view the art. Great room on the 8th floor. The shower is awesome: not just a walk in but a sit in with a jack and jill sink. Nice bath amenities from Bigelow. Great bar with awesome bar keeps Maxwell and Kyle. I'd make a trip to Phoenix even in the summer just to stay here.Thank you! We are so happy to hear you had a great stay! Please visit again soon.,Good
"Absolutely loved staying here. The room was impeccably clean, inviting and a decent size for 4 people. The staff were fairly young and were super-friendly and enthusiastic about recommending things for us to do. They gave us some great advice on local hotspots (Mexican restaurant in the the Mission District and Belden Place), and we also booked a city sightseeing tour through them. The hotel is in such a good location and is only a quick walk to Union Square, the Powell-Mason Cable Car, the BART and the huge Westfield shopping centre. There's also a lovely coffee shop called Bread Cocoa next door. Big drawcards: complimentary wi-fi and wine hour! Next time I go back to San Fran I will not even consider staying somewhere else.",Good
"Second visit and stay..... It just keeps getting better! All of the staff and the amenities are over the top!

"Stayed at this hotel for Allstar weekend/ Mardi Gras.. Absolutely loved the location.. The rooms are huge.. The hotel is far enough to be away from the noise of festivities, but also walking distance to everything.. Bourbon street is literally a 5 min walk..

Was really nervous about staying in a hotel for an extended amount of time but my school is close by and my degree demanded I suck it up! Sue was such a tremendous help to me and she really made sure I got everything I needed as well as gave me some great tips for my stay in SD. I only wish there were more front desk agents like Sue and Darletta (hope I spelled that right). This is definitely my 1 place to stay when I'm in town. Thank you ladies! Fully loaded kitchen plus they provide dishes. Bathroom was bigger than mine at home lolI want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay.

"5 of us ladies stayed in the 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite. The kitchen area consisted of a microwave, oven and refrigerator. Plenty of space in the main area and bedrooms (small bathrooms though), comfortable bedding, clean, friendly staff, complimentary breakfast each morning. I also loved room service requests were filled immediately (extra towels). The only downfall is parking, which valet of 30/day is your best bet if you don't want to risk getting a ticket. Easy walking distance to a few restaurants and the corner store. You can't beat the location and great price so I would recommend and would definitely stay again! We really appreciate the positive feedback! Parking is not our favorite thing either but it is in-line with our area. We are actually are one of the cheapest. I'm sure the readers appreciate your review on possibly getting a ticket if you decide to park in the public areas. I'm sure it will be helpful for others. Thank you,Devin H",Good

"This is not a review of the hotel itself, but of the customer service. On a trip to SF last month, we made a mistake in our hotel booking (not at the Galleria Park) and were forced to scramble for a room elsewhere. We thought all was well when we got a room at the Galleria Park through a third-party site. That turned out to be wrong, as we discovered when we tried to check inthe hotel was already fully booked. It would have been easy for the staff to simply turn us away. Instead, Kevin, the operations manager, and Wendy, at the reception desk, expended considerable time and effort on rechecking the reservation system for a potential opening and looking for alternatives elsewhere in the affiliated JDV properties, all while making us comfortable as we waited. We hope to finally try the hotel itself on a future visit to SF we know the service will be exceptional.Dear DDMJTL,Thank you for sharing your experience at the Galleria Park with regards to assisting you find alternative accommodations. It's unfortunate that we were not able to accommodate you, but I'm glad that both Kevin and Wendy were able to find you a room at one of our sister hotels.I shared your review with both Kevin, Wendy and the rest of our staff. It means a lot to us when our guests post positive reviews online, especially when our guests remember the names of our staff members. Thank you, again.Sincerely,James Limjlimjdvhotels.com",Good

"I stayed in the BW Bayside for 5 nights from May 29-June 3rd this year with my Mum and friend. I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival requesting a high floor room and harbour view. I was delighted when they allocated us a room like that as requested. Thanks for that Silvia! The view was beautiful. After a very long journey over from Dublin, Ireland we sank into really comfortable beds. Room furnishings were lovely, spotless room, great shower and the bonus of the fridge and micrwave were very welcome. Breakfast was perfectly adequate and we enjoyed it, the waiters were lovely down there. We were always given great assistance at reception in terms of directions, recommendations etc They helped us get transport to and from the Viejas Casino Resort aswell(although I wish we hadnt gone and spent so much !!) and they were always friendly, courteous and polite.We used the pool, sunloungers etc for a whole afternoon and it was bliss..plenty of sunlight down there from 12-5pm...only wished I'd have spent more time there actually. Location of the hotel was perfect..just around the corner from the trolley tour bus. We also caught the tram/train to the shopping outlets in San Ysidro- right on the Mexican border...we went into Mexico for the day, was fun but the queues to get out were very very long. Shopping was great in the outlets and only 40 mins away. I thought the location of the hotel was v central...right in between all areas of interest..Little Italy, Gaslamp even Old Town..it was the perfect base actually.We availed of the shuttle bus heading back to the airport which was yet another bonus. This hotel had everything you would possibly need and I would definitley stay there again. Very reasonably priced too. Thanks everyone in the hotel and restaurant for being so welcoming and well done on giving us a lovley stay in beautiful San Diego.Dear DeniseMcC, Thank you for choosing to stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego.

"We spent two nights (Fri/Sat) at the Kimpton Hotel Allegro while seeing 2 shows in Chicago. Access from O'Hare to the hotel by train was easy, The hotel let us check in early and the room was very nice. They have a 5pm champaign happy hour that we attended both nice and ended up meeting and having great conversations with other guests. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations, especially when it rained all day on Saturday and we had already been to the usual museums on previous trips. The only negative was the slow elevators with only 2 of the 3 being operational.Hello! Thank you kindly for taking the time to review our hotel. While we are pleased to see that you had a positive stay overall, we offer our apologies for the poor service of the elevators during you're stay. We are in the process of remodeling our elevators now so that we may better serve our guests. We hope to welcome you back for an improved experience in the future!",Good

"We have stayed at this hotel for three straight years. We in this case includes myself, my wife, and our 8 kids. The kids have ranged in ages from 1 year old up to 17 years old (depending on the stay) and we have loved it every time.We have stayed in a suite each year and at least one (sometimes two) other rooms. The suite with the adjoining room is great for our needs.The location is perfect. Right near the Bart, right in Union Square. Need a quick bite to eat for a picky kid Subway is next door. Want a quick ice cream for a kid (or adult) quickly Cold Stone right next door, as well. And of course you are within about a 3 minute walk of 100 other restaurants of 35 different types.Why do we keep coming back to the same hotel with all the other choices SERVICE! This place just gets it. They put an emphasis on service that is difficult to find. There may be hotels with more room or for better prices. But knowing that we will be treated exceptionally well and knowing the staff will help us out with any questions or needs is worth the extra few dollars. My only complaint is that the suite has bathroom doors of frosted glass so you can see the silhouette of the person standing in the bathroom or getting out of the shower. Not perfect for a family, and also the door is sliding, no locks. Made more for a couple than a family, so communication is important to avoid any issues. Still, more than worth the minor inconvenience with all this hotel offers.Hello Mark B,Thank you for taking the time to share your holiday experience with us. It is ALWAYS a pleasure to have you and your family celebrate the holidays with our family here at AbRi.

"I stay at the Waverly every November for work. We have a very large group and essentially take over the hotel and all the conference rooms and also rent out the trade show facility at the Cobb Galleria that is attached. The hotel is VERY clean and the rooms are very pretty, spacious and comfy. The beds are the best hotel beds I've ever slept in. Triple sheeted, feather bed, lots of pillows, etc.My one compaint from the last trip was when the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. I was on the 14th floor and the hotel is in the round, all the rooms look down into the atrium area. When the alarm went off I exited the room and looked down into the atrium to see what was going on. I could see a few people at the reception desk and a couple of girls behind it but no one from the hotel seemed to be directing people or even paying attention to the alarm. Lots of other people left their rooms as well and we kind of waited to see if anyone from the hotel would wave at us or give direction which never happened. The alarm did not shut off though. I decided to take the elevator down but because of the alarm the elevators were in lock down. It was around this time that I realized I had left my key in the room. I didn't want to take the stairs down 14 floors in my pajamas and bc no hotel staff seemed concerned with the alarm most people went back to their rooms. I used the phone in my co-worker's room to call to be let into my room and the desk agent said they were investigating the alarm. It took about 30 minutes for someone to open my room which was probably bc he had to climb those stairs. I'm still shocled and confused over how they handled the alarm. It was bizarre that they didn't have anyone directing people or telling us it was a false alarm, etc.Other than that it's a great hotel and the conference facilities are fantastic, the food is yummy and the rooms are lovely. Unfortunately you have to pay for internet.",Good

"We stayed the week before Christmas 2014 and asked for a room with an interior courtyard, window view. Intention was to keep street noise to a minimum. Location of the hotel is on Decatur street and in the middle of the north and south borders of the French Quarter. This makes it 3 blocks from the middle of Bourbon street, 2 blocks from Royal street, which is where a lot of the boutiques, art shops, and museums are, 2 blocks from Jackson Square and as far as possible from Louis Armstrong Park. We were warned that Louis Armstrong Park is not safe to be around after dark. The hotel's location also puts you with 1 block of the contemporary shopping near the Mississippi River if that interests you.First, know that the hotel is a composite of 5 different buildings, each with their own specifics, that have been combined into one hotel. Courtyard is paved stone and very nice. Pool is not heated. WiFi is available throughout the property. Most of the property pictures show a great walk-in stand up shower big enough for 2 people but be aware that not all the rooms have that. Some of the rooms have a standard tub/shower.The first room (2nd floor) we were given was very big with lots of floor space but was right next to a noisy elevator and was audible even with the shower on and there was a drip that could be heard in the bathroom vent that was most likely from condensation. Second room offered (2nd floor) required a walk up a flight of stairs as there was not an elevator that connected to the outside balcony. This is why you need to check which room you are getting if you have any trouble maneuvering stairs cause of age or know ahead of time you will be drinking.Third, fourth, and fifth rooms were tiny boxes and felt claustrophobic there was now outside window. With a queen size bed and 2 side tables, available floor space was minimal. You could stand at the food of the bed and touch the wall where the flat screen television was mounted. These rooms were accessible to an interior elevator and hallway.Sixth room was acceptable but we had to give up the nice stand-up shower for a regular tub. There was walking space in the room but it was only partially accessible from the elevator. Luggage was carried another 40' to the room by way of a balcony walkway.the woman at the registration was very helpful to let us check the rooms out before settling on one.The next day we were able to switch to a vacated room. This room was the best. It was large enough that it would take 4 twin beds to fill the floor space. Queen bed, 2 side tables, bench at the foot of the bed, armchair with reading table and lamp, and stand up shower. These are the attached pictures.Again, review the room when you arrive as the prices won't help you discern which room is which.",Good
"Stayed at the Ritz for 3 nights last weekend with husband and daughter. The club level service was amazing, as was service all over the hotel, from the check -in to the door men to the people who cleaned the room. I used the concierge several times, and was able to get into a restaurant that showed up as nothing available on Open Table by using the Ritz' contacts.The club had (alcoholic) drinks available all day , or at least every time we stopped. The bites sized portions served at the pre dinner hour were plentiful and had great variety.Breakfast was nice. Would have been nice to include an egg option,maybe scrambled eggs or something. We had bagels with smoked salmon or oatmeal most mornings. The coffee was good as well.The only thing that was not perfect was that each bed nobly had to flattened out down pillows on it , so we asked for a couple extra which were brought up immediately with a smile.Thank you to the Ritz for a memorable stay !",Good
"This hotel is like being in Mecca if you're idea of Nirvana is shopping. It is very easy to locate in Seattle. The car valets were helpful and courteous. The front desk staff were prompt. And the concierge, well, he was the absolute best we have ever had. He had suggestions for shows, attractions, timelines, and restaurants. He even made suggestions for what to order off the menus!The room we had was a standard with a small queen. It was a corner room with 2 windows that opened to let in fresh air (yes, you need fresh air even in frigid February). It was a little stuffy without the windows being left open. I would say spend a little extra money and get a deluxe room with a king. The bathroom was also very small and not big enough for 2 people sharing! Definitely need either 2 bathrooms (as some of the more deluxe rooms have), or ask for one with a larger bathroom.However, we didn't spend hardly any time in the hotel as we were out and about so much.The location was ideal. One block from either direction of both Macy's and Nordstrom's (and about 6 Starbuck's coffee bars in a 4 block radius). Plus, just 5 minute walks from other name-brand chains. And close to Pike Place market and great venues like the Triple Door, and fantastic restaurants. Too many restaurants to choose from. All that means is that we will need to go back and try them all out. And we will definitely be staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel plan to make it 'our hotel' whenever we go to Seattle.",Good

The gym was also very nice.Thank you for your feedback! We're happy we can accomodate our guests needs while they are traveling with great service and amenities. Hope to see you again on your next trip to Seattle. Sarah S. Guest Relations Manager,Good
I usually stay at the Chain hotels when I come to New Orleans. Unfortunately this weekend they were all sold out. I was quite skeptical to book here since I've heard so many horror stories about New Orleans hotels. Boy was I wrong. This was one of the best stays I've had in New Orleans. Room was clean. Staff was friendly and it's right in the middle of everything. Had a great stay.,Good
"Check-in was easy quick. Room was clean, bathroom and all room necessities in working order. A/C-Heat was easy to control. Coffee/Tea available 24h in breakfast area along with fresh fruit. Very friendly staff from front desk, housekeeping to breakfast attendants. Greeted by everyone with a Good Morning or Good Afternoon Breakfast area was well maintained and kept clean and attendants were extremely nice and attentive to the customers. Location is right the airport with a shuttle available. Train to downtown is available the airport or there is a station 0.5 miles away. TIP: Get the Day Pass to travel around the city, especially downtown area. You can get off the train, onto the subway or bus using the pass for 1 price.Thank you for taking the time to give us a review. We are delighted that your stay with the Fairfield Inn Philadelphia Airport was enjoyable. Everything we do is aimed at providing you with an excellent hotel experience and your feedback is extremely valuable. We truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts with us so that we may continue to deliver exceptional service in the future.",Good
"We arrived at this hotel at 11am and our room 709 was ready. No noise comfortable room. The roof top pool was OK temperature for a night swim, even though it was cold outside. Jacuzzi was hot. Small exercize room. On major bus lines but it was quicker to walk to French Quarter and Riverwalk. The breakfast and afternoon kickback were good. Three well drinks p/p at happy hour made me happy. The entire hotel was very clean, well maintained and in a safe neighborhood. And by the way, we took the public bus from the airport for 2. It is called Jefferson transit,leaves every half hour, you can take two pieces of luggage, it took 1/2 hour to arrive three blocks from the hotel.",Good
"Had an extended weekend stay to celebrate big anniversary! This hotel looked very nice and had a perfect locale so we took a chance. We made a great choice! The hotel is perfectly clean and very large. We got a suite with a bay view and it was perfect. We even had a view of the famous red Public Market sign! No trouble locating Pike's Place with that view! Room was spotless and bed super comfy. Pillows are little lacking too soft, no support but we still slept really well. Check in was a breeze. When they heard it was our 25th, the gal comped our valet for the entire stay and sent up a bottle pinot grigio! We appreciated her thoughtfulness and enjoyed the wine. Bathroom is luxurious and spotless. Huge shower and separate huge tub were glorious! First time spending a significant amount of time in Seattle and we loved every minute. Thanks Hyatt, we'll be back!",Good
"We stayed at this hotel while attending an event at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Our room was comfortable and more than adequate. The hotel was very busy, but we slept great and were not bothered by noise. The hotel was really convenient to the Wells Fargo Center and not being from the area, the drive was easy. Breakfast was busy but well stocked and the staff was friendly and helpful.We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you again soon!",Good
"This was our 2nd stay at PACIFIC SHORES INN. Last January we visited and booked again this year because we were so delighted with the property. Travelling with two small dogs can be difficult and staying here made it quite easy. There is a reasonable fee of course, but everyone was kind and open to their presence. We had 3 adults staying in a ground floor room with two queen beds. There was plenty of room, the room was clean, there was a frig, coffee maker and micro wave. Great place to travel with young children. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping staff was cheerful and available to help with extra towels, etc. What more could you want from a beach front hotel with the most beautiful winter sunsets off the San Diego coast We wil be back soon!!First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to write this review. I am also glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and of course, your pets are always welcome here. We are one of the few properties that do accept pets and we know many by their names. You also mentioned the sunsets, where everyday is a unique experience!!!! That never gets old, and is one of the perks of managing this property!!",Good
"Overnight stay. Room were clean and comfortable bed was soft and cozy. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was typical muffins,fruit,cereal and waffles. The only complaint would be the noise from the room above us was usually loud.",Good
"We rented a cabin on site. Great open nature setting. Very Pet Friendly and clean!!! Was able to build a camp fire, and heard the river in the background. Roasted marshmallows. Walked 3 minutes to downtown bar. Great stay and MUST for any outdoors types with pets.",Good
I came in for a wedding and wanted to be in the heart of it all. It is a beautiful place and I shall return. The hotel was pricey for the amount of space and amenities but the I enjoyed everything else. Will return for a longer stay with friends to explore more and do more!,Good

"One of the top stays in the U.S., stayed in a suite with an adjoining den.Excellent quality of service including kid size slippers and robe - unbeatable at most other hotels.Ambiance in the hotel is nice, and room is very clean and well appointed.Highly recommend staying here.",Good
"This is a remarkable hotel just steps away from the Magnificent Mile and easy walking distance to many landmarks. We were greeted very warmly and directed to the 20th floor for check in. As others have noted there are spectacular views of the city from that floor and a winding staircase that leads to a lounging area below. The business center is located on this floor as well.We had a fairly easy check in and had a valet bring our luggage to our room. The key is unique. In order to get to a particular floor outside of the 20th floor lobby or the ground floor you must tap it against a circular disc and then choose your floor. It works the same way with your room.The valet explained everything in detail including the complimentary items that you may have forgotten on your packing list, shoe shine, as well as the traditional bathrobes and slippers you may borrow during your visit. There are at least 4 cupboards with storage space, closet spaces drawers, and a safe to store your valuables in. These cupboards are located immediately to your left in our case as you come in. From there you head into the main bedroom.Once you enter the main bedroom there is a huge TV in the center along with a very long table that angled to your right with outlets for your laptop, etc. Everything is electronically controlled by the various buttons in different parts of your room including your blinds and lighting. The bathroom is state of the art consisting of two sinks, toilet, and a large shower area. There is no bathtub which I came to understand is the new trend these days.The shower was warm and inviting. For privacy both the entrance to the bathroom and the toilet area have sliding doors. The room also comes with an expresso/coffee machine and in the drawer below are your cups as well as your Keurig style blends for the machine. Teabags are also available. Below that is a mini fridge. Our valet was very nice enough to get ice for us as well as extra water since we had traveled a long distance. They also provide you with an extra blanket in case you get cold and you can self adjust your room temperature. You would find the blanket in the upper part of one of the cupboards. Also the room is small but long enough so one doesn't feel cramped.The room was impeccable clean and fresh however, it wasn't until we went to bed that I noticed what our room lacked. Having two queen beds was nice and there were lamps on the far side of each bed but no lamp in the center. Yes, there was overhead lighting but not enough to light up the center area. In addition, the center nightstand had no drawer in it and neither did the side stands nor the long tables under the TV nor off to the right. There was a settee right under the TV but we found it useless. It appeared we had a corner room since there was a comfortable chair to unwind in there. The beds were very comfortable to sleep in.The only thing on the center stand was a clock with a jack for an MP3 or IPhone to play your own music. The phone was located across the room near the TV. Therefore if we wanted a wake up call then we would actually have to find a light (which is a bit hard to do with the electronic board) get up and walk to the phone. Also we had to lay everything out that wasn't needed on one of the table tops in order to sleep. I ended up using one of small drawers in the cupboard in order to store these small items when not in use. I really didn't like the fact I had to walk over to the cupboard area just to stow these things and remember where I had placed them. They weren't valuable but the usual stuff one would need to have handy.It took us a while to find the bathroom outlets since they were hidden by the towels hanging on the racks. Although not needed a shaving/makeup portable mirror mounted to the wall would have added a nice touch. I did like the fact that you have a doorbell entry and you can press a button for privacy and to have the room made up. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Time did not permit us to dine there or check out the fitness area but I'm sure we would have been pleased with their services.Valet parking is 70.00 per day and it runs in 24 hour cycles from the time of arrival. This is a wonderful hotel with great location and excellent customer service. Even though we weren't far from Northwestern Memorial we were seldom disturbed by ambulances. However, little things do matter on a trip and it is very easy to overlook until the time comes that you need them. I would definitely recommend they put a lamp between the two beds along with a 2nd phone and add drawers to the nightstands as well as one in the work station area. I mostly definitely would stay here again since the pros definitely outweigh the cons.Dear Arlene M.,Thank you kindly for your detailed account of your recent stay at the Conrad Chicago. I'm pleased everything turned out well and thank you for your feedback regarding the room amenities and layout. I'm especially pleased the team went out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home while staying with us. We look forward to the great opportunity to be able to have you stay with us again. Sincerely,Tod Chambers",Good
"Hotels in Seattle are very pricey. We chose this based on lower price, and a little further away from attractions. We actually ended up walking everywhere, being within one mile of any attraction we wanted to see. The room was comfortable and large. Adequate wifi. Bathroom a bit dated but clean. Breakfast has many options, with great coffee, but was very crowded. Being close to a freeway, which you do hear, the hotel provides a white noise machine in the room, which we used and helped sleep somewhat.I'm very grateful for your review and support. It's great everything from our prices to our amenities and breakfast work for you. The team is looking forward to welcoming you back! -Frank F., General Manager",Good
"My husband and I visited NOLA for the first time and stayed at the St. James. It was wonderful! Megan, at the front desk, greeted us with a smile and a friendly comment, every time she saw us and was more than willing to help us newcomers find places to visit. She helped us with times, directions, and any other questions we asked ...always with a smile! Our European breakfast was delivered by a very friendly,smiling,waiter and every other staff member we encountered, greeted us and interacted as if we mattered. How refreshing! It is not a hotel for partying people and not located in the hub-bub of that environment...but it is within walking distance to almost everything you'd want: Bourbon Street, Canal Street, French Quarter etc...we walked through all of that and loved it! The room was clean, comfortable and beds are comfy! We highly recommend it to anyone..even newcomers such as we were. We will be going back.",Good

"My first time visiting the city, and I am so glad I chose this hotel. I was in town for a marathon the city was hosting. I arrived a few days early so that I could tour the city as well as rest a bit. As with any walking friendly city, location is so important. Trust me, It was centrally located. In one day, I walked to the CenturyLink Field event center for the expo, visited the market, the needle, and hopped aboard a ferry. Upon my return, I had the choice of a relaxing bath in a spacious tub or a quick shower. Definitely after the marathon, that tub came in handy!!! I was able to sleep comfortably every night which was very important for my mindset. Every evening I would return to a clean room with everything I had requested. Housekeeping was very attentive. Also, there's a Starbucks inside the hotel as well as a place that makes hot sandwiches which came in very handy for my last minute carb fix. If ever in Seattle again, I'm staying here!!Thank you for your comments. We're so happy that you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of all the amenities to prep and decompress from your marathon. It's wonderful that you were also able to explore the city and even get on the water while you were here! We would love to have you back with us during your next visit to Seattle.Best Regards,Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager",Good

"Great location in a historic French quarter hotel. Parts of this Inn date back to the 1700's when it was a bakery. It was eventually purchased by Baroness Pontalba (Jackson Square visionary) who turned it into an Inn to host her many friends and visitors. Each room, floor, wing are unique. We had a king deluxe room on the courtyard side that was clean, comfortable and quiet, even in carnival season. Front of the house staff very friendly. No room service or restaurant, but Pablo's coffee is next door, Cafe Du Monde is right down the street, and there are many other wonderful, near by places for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!. The courtyard is a quiet place to be outside away from the hustle of the streets, the pool is inviting but unheated. If you prefer charm over generic hotel chains, this is a great option.We are happy to hear that you found your stay to your satisfaction and thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. We look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.",Good

"The location is fabulous if you want to be in the French Quarter. Rooms are a little dated, but nice, still quiet even though it's one block off Bourbon street, and the Bombay Club bar/restaurant was great. I would come back and would recommend. I would say this is an epitomy of a New Orleans old charm hotel.Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your stay! We work hard to meet expectations and were happy that we hit the mark. We hope to have the pleasure of hosting you again during your next visit to New Orleans!",Good
"Stayed here with my family over Spring Break in a 2-bedroom suite. Great location, right on the Street Car Line with easy access to downtown and Space Needle. Staff was very pleasant, and hotel was clean and beds were comfy. Breakfast was ok - free and ample, but not the tastiest. Worst thing about the hotel (and it's not really that bad) was the coffee.",Good
"The best decision I've made recently, was choosing this great motel in the very pleasant community of Philipsburg. Great host, very friendly and knowledgeable of the immediate area.

"Hotel clearly exceeded our expectations: Room nice and clean, breakfast reasonable variety, gym well equipped, location at Lake Union with a couple of nice restaurants, downtown easily reached by streetcar, really nothing to complain about at all. Staff was friendly and helpful. I think this hotel is a great find in Seattle! Some may argue the location is a bit off, however, I beg to differ: Not sure I would want to stay downtown Seattle, which gets a bit deserted at night. All in all a great experience!Thanks for sharing your wonderful feedback regarding your recent stay at the Residence Inn on Lake Union. We love our little spot on the lake here and especially enjoy all of the great amenities surrounding the hotel for our guests to enjoy. Cheers!",Good

"When going to Times Square, I always arrive from Penn station (from Newark airport, best ans ceapest way by train).This hotel sits right in the middle between Penn and TS. Only there for a short stay, the rooms are nothing to write to your mother about, however. Quite small. Furnitures were not meant to fit in that kind of room. Reminds me of Japan lolStaff is vey professionnal, however did not try as hard as I would have expected to meet my small requests. Breakfast was good, but the set-up again is all packed in a little area. But this is NYC prime location. And the price is very affodble. and You are not here to stay in the room. So, I recommend this hotel if you are an IHC fan. I'll stay there again.Dear expatsing,Thank you for posting your review of our Holiday Inn Express Times Square. I am glad our location was convenient to your needs. We apologize if our rooms were not what you were expecting.

Staff is friendly and helpful. Nightly rates will vary according to season, holidays and days of the week, but we were greatly satisfied with what we paid. Look for deals online.

The bathroom was beautiful and very clean, yet again, small. The walls are thin, so if anyone talks loudly, you can hear them.

"The Best Western was surprisingly quite an affordable hotel. The lobby looked like it was recently renovated, and the rooms did not appear to be dated. Beds were comfortable and the multiple amounts of pillows were fluffy. Rooms have a fridge and microwave. Location was pretty decent. Right in the middle of Little Italy and Gaslamp. Easily walking distance between the two.Big advantage they offer free airport pick-up and drop off (just call once you land at the San Diego airport). Also, they offered free breakfast which was pretty decent better than your average free breakfast (they had scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, muffins, oatmeal, toast, etc.). Front staff was friendly and helpful.Drawbacks morning coffee was horrible and their fruit selection was not only weak but the fruits were old, dried out and flavourless. But these drawbucks are not enough to not stay here again.Thank you for providing a detailed review of your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn. We are pleased you found our pricing to be affordable and the beds were comfortable! We appreciate your feedback about the coffee and fruit, this will help us make improvements to our complimentary breakfast buffet for all of our guests.

This hotel is next to the Miami airport. If you like to watch the planes come in for landing this is the hotel for that.

"I thought I would have a look to see what others thought of this wonderful place and could not believe my eyes when I saw negative comments.I was in orlando for business and was moved to this hotel half way through my stay for geographical reasons. Upon my arrival the staff were very friendly, accomodating and professional. I was told shuttle buses to the airport left every 20 minutes were I could transfer to a variety of Lynx bus routes. I did not have a car during my trip but from what I saw of the car park, it looked just like any other. The shuttle drivers were very pleasent especially Angel and Brian. I used the shuttle several times during my trip.As for the rooms I have absolutly no complaints! They were full suits with a living area and bedroom area. Especially as I was on my own it was VERY spacious. There was a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, hair dryer as well as 2 TV's (1 in each area of the room). The pool area/courtyard was very tranquil with palm trees and other shrubbery. There were some small live animals around (frogs, gheckos etc) but these are found throughout florida anyway. The pool was a combination outdoor/indoor pool with a divider in the wall and chairs or sunbeds in both areas. Sadly the jacuzzi was out of use but these things happen.All meals were wonderful, especially the american breakfast buffet which had hot and cold choices. The evening meals were delicious even if a little expensive but again that's what you get in hotels.To be blunt if what you want is a palace then ask the Queen of England if you can come for a visit otherwise this will suit the needs of any normal person. The only draw back to this hotel is that if you want to visit the theame parks, you are very far away.",Good

"Comfortable hotel right of I-4. We have stayed here previously and will not hesitate to return again. We were warmly greeted, check-in was quick and easy. Our 6th floor room was quiet and comfortable. The balcony was large enough for 4 people to sit and talk.Not a single complaint. It rained the day we were up and we got soaked. Since we did not pack extra stuff, we needed to do laundry. Soap and the machine use were complimentary. Wi-Fi was easy to setup. Fridge in the room, and bistro available downstairs.All in all, we will be back. This is our go-to hotel when visiting our kids in downtown Orlando.",Good
"When traveling through Chicago I booked two nights downtown at the Conrad. Originally I was hoping to stay at the Hilton, however the Conrad turned out to be an excellent option. Upon arrival the front staff was incredibly helpful. I had some minor adjustments to the reservations that required additional work on the part of the staff member and he was fantastic (regrettably I cannot recall his name). During check in I was informed that the hotel was completely booked and they had no complimentary Gold Hhonors upgrades available. As it turns out I found the standard room to be more than satisfactory and spacious. I used the gym twice during my stay and found the equipment to be in great condition, the entire facility was very clean and well maintained. I thought the location adjacent to Michigan Avenue, as well as other downtown attractions was also great, extremely easy to get around and find fun places to explore.My best tips when staying at the Conrad include the following:1) Take advantage of the text message concierge service they offer. I had questions throughout the trip about various things related to the hotel. I messaged the number provided and within a few minutes I received a reply. Everything from the gym hours to checking out of the room they handled flawlessly. 2) Have breakfast at the hotel restaurant Baptiste Bottle. Located directly next to the front desk on the 20 (something) floor, the views over Michigan Avenue could not get any better, not to mention the food was excellent.Dear kaarlb, Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your recent Conrad Chicago visit. I'm sorry we had no available upgrades to recognize your loyalty as a Gold Hilton Honors member, but I'm glad you found the standard room to be quite comfortable. I want to thank you for sharing your feedback with other travelers, we look forward to welcome you back next time you are in Chicago. Sincerely, Tod Chambers",Good

"We stayed at the Bienville House Hotel with friends at the beginning of October. We found it to be a lovely boutique hotel. Our room had a king size four poster bed. Quite honestly the bed could use a new mattress but we were so busy during the day we were exhausted at night and slept just fine. The staff were VERY helpful and friendly. The continental breakfast was certainly adequate and fresh and the coffee was great. Yes, the pool is small and not much sun gets on it, but I didn't goto New Orleans to swim or I would have picked another hotel. My first visit to New Orleans was fantastic.",Good

"This place is a fantastic deal. It seems like the common areas have recently been renovated. The staff was absolutely wonderful and the amenities are pretty good. There is a hot tub, heated pool, fitness center, and continental breakfast. The breakfast was pretty standard, nothing special. My only complaint about this place is the cramped parking lot with no elevators. Otherwise my family and I truly enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable here. I would definitely recommend it!",Good

Excellent staff clean environment. Staff takes great pride in their work I definitely would stay again. Hotel was the best Hampton inn I've stayed at. I ve no reservations about this facility. Hilton chain should be proud.,Good
"We have been frequent guests at this hotel since it opened. The location is great if you want to be close to Downtown Disney and also I-Drive. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. The suites have clean, comfortable beds. The full kitchen is a plus for heating up leftovers or making light meals on the weekends. The suites have a separate bedroom, which is great for families. The bathrooms are the standard mini tub/shower combination. There is only one vanity, which is fortunately outside of the tub and toilet area. I really wish that hotels would do away with those ridiculous tubs and just put in showers for most of the rooms. The living room furniture is standard for all Homewood Suites. I don't think the buyer ever had to sit on the couch or chair. All of the furniture is very rigid and quickly becomes uncomfortable. On a positive note, there is a tray on the ottoman that you can use to bring food up to the room from the reception area. Pros- location, staff, consistent Hilton service, adequate breakfastCons- no evening meals Friday- Sunday, living furniture is very uncomfortable. Overall, if you are in the area, you can't go wrong with this property.",Good
"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"You can't get any closer to the Space Needle in terms of accommodation it's right across the street! Fantastic view of the Space Needle from the hotel's rooftop deck, especially at night. Front desk staff were very friendly and eager to please. Free hotel shuttle anywhere within one mile of the hotel was helpful for getting to and from the waterfront and Pike Place market. Hotel decor was too cold and masculine for what I would expect from a Hyatt. Only two elevators made for a long wait to get down to the lobby in the mornings. Breakfast in the lobby bar was pretty good. Only had one delicious made-to-order omelette though because the wait was so long I gave up. No signage when you arrive telling you where to park your car while you check in. But a good experience overall, and with the prime location, I would stay there again.BeachLounger2008,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of the ready-to-order omelet, complimentary breakfast spread in the morning and rooftop terrace in the evening. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge",Good
"First the people were very friendly and helpful! The breakfast was good, would of been nice to have some eggs and a meat but you get to make your own waffles, they have fresh fruit, milk, juice, cereal, bagels among other things so by far better than a regular old continental breakfast! The room was great, could not have been any cleaner if we were the first persons to stay there and the fact that it was recently remodeled shows. We were there for my sons Marine graduation and his Uncle stayed at a more expensive hotel by the bay and had to change rooms 3 times then ended up changing hotels all together and still didn't get one with a working A/C. He got no fridge or microwave with his room either, that was an extra cost, my room came with both at no extra cost along with a coffee pot, hair drier and iron. The new A/C in this room kept it really cold in the room just like we like it. The bathtub was so clean with the new tile and tub it didn't even have a water stain anywhere. Had 2 queen beds that are almost as comfortable as my double pillow top at home! Nice soft fluffy pillows! The only bad thing we could say about our whole 4 day stay there was the pool is very small, but worse than that is the fact that it is either not heated or they had not turned it on yet, so the water was too chilly to swim. But I can live with that for the extra comfort of the stay. Also the interstate was not too far from my room but I heard nothing over the steady hum of my A/C. The free WiFi worked good, not real fast but reliable, and the parking lot was a tight fit the free parking was a added bonus considering some hotels in San Diego charge up to 38 a night to park in their lot! Would stay there again any time! Thanks for making our stay so comfortable!!!",Good
"Todd the front desk was very professional. Rebecca spoiled the clients like a mother hen. These two employees are really asset to that place where they work.

We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and that Rebecca and Todd were able to enhance your stay with us. We will be sure to commemorate these two great employees for going above and beyond for you.

However, we do greatly value you as a guest, and hope to continue to keep Best Western in mind the next time you need a place to stay.",Good
"This hotel is conveniently situated near the Riverwalk Convention area as well as the Bourbon Street area. I walked from my hotel to both of these locations for a week. This hotel is clean, nostalgic, and accommodating. We received free drink cards upon check-in for drinks in the lobby from 530P to 7P. Although there are no restaurants in this hotel, they can get delivery of almost anything you can think of as far as food. The first night I was there, I was leary of walking to a nearby restaurant or Bourbon Street, but there was no need to be. This hotel is growing and has a brand new wing that will open in about 6-12 months. The construction commenced M-F starting at 7A, but no contruction on the weekends! I believe the cost was very good for the accommodations and service.",Good

"Stayed here with my wife 7/26 27 hotel is in a great spot in the city just off of the river and directly across from the Trump building. It is within walking distance of Navy Pier and surrounded by great restaurants. The restaurant within the hotel has a very extensive menu though we didn't eat there. But we did have a few drinks and the staff is very hospitable. If the weather had been cooler we would have sat outside.The hotel was very clean and our room was nice the only thing I didn't like was there was no counter in the bathroom but this could have been because our room seemed to be handicap accessible, perhaps that was error in the reservation not sure.Overall it was fun staff was nice, hotel was clean, and we had a good trip.Thank you, Tyler W, for choosing the River Hotel and posting your review.

"If you've seen the movie Trains, Planes and Automobiles, you can partially gain an insight as to what my staff and I went through during the 2007 Valentine's Day storm trying to leave New York City to head back to Los Angeles. I'll spare you the ugly details of what happened, but I can say that the ordeal ended on a very positive note. Somehow we wound up in Philadelphia en route to the Philadelphia airport and needed a clean, warm, close place to stay along with important features such as free hi-speed Internet access and a hot breakfast. The Hampton Inn was remarkable. The staff was gracious and the rooms were very pleasant. Little touches such as a long Ethernet cable that extended across the room, warm fresh cookies served in the lobby and free shuttle service from the train and to the airport made all the difference in 16 degree weather. We made it back to Los Angeles a few days later than planned, but the Hampton Inn made that delay manageable.",Good
"Left my IPad at the motel, but did not miss until I was out of the state. After the front desk verified the IPad was found, I was told by Mohomad the procedure to follow to retrieve the item.

"Positives:- The room was absolutely spectacular. We loved the room that we were assigned. High ceilings, plenty of space, great decor. Historic photographs, views of the skyline. It was just awesome.- Nice locations near the Public Gardens and walkable to restaurants and attractions- The building felt historic and full of characterNegatives:- The parking situation was absolutely awful. Parking was only available at the Boston Common garage for a fee of 30-something a day, which isn't so bad, but the distance from the hotel is very far and in an underground garage. This really detracted from the overall experience and we wouldn't recommend it to others that have driven a car to the hotel. I would say stay at this hotel if you do not have a car with you.- Hotel staff were average, we did not feel welcomed by any of them.- The breakfast was poor - low quality food and some cheap automatic coffee maker",Good
We had a private chef over for my husbands birthday and the kitchen amenities and room view did not disappoint. It was comfortable for six people and the hotel had a high chair for our toddler to use throughout the trip. Room cleaning service was prompt daily and proactively called to see if we needed service on the one day we stayed in. Thank you! Aloha 27Lei!Wow! What an amazing experience. I am so happy to hear that you had such a wonderful time while staying with us and that you enjoyed the villa and amenities. A hui hou!,Good
"I was told by the Westin agent that this was far enough down on Bourbon St that it would be ok for my 8 and 9 yr old. Well, before we got in the door my kids saw what they called 3 naked girls...with paint on them. I asked the people at the desk if could switch to a different hotel and John Fisher, at the desk, helped us out and got us a switch over to The W....much better atmosphere for kids!",Good
"We enjoyed our stay here for the most part. The basics were all covered: friendly staff clean room comfortable beds and we slept well. However, the dining area for the complimentary breakfast was too small for the size of the hotel. It was packed by the time we checked out around 8:30 am and so I'm glad we ate breakfast early!",Good
"We are frequent Westin villa travelers and are very impressed with the Nanea! The villa itself is very modern and unlike many of the other villas we have been to - has a full oven ! So you could make many meals and bake throughout your stay. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The pool area is lovely although a bit small it does have a nice area for those with really little ones but we found it very relaxing ... ( there werent a ton of kids running around and loud) if you want even quieter adult time - there are a couple of plunge pools and many lounge chairs much further back from the larger pools where kids typically are. We are in a one bedroom premium and even though it is only the 2 of us there is a large dining table on the patio that seats 6 and in the kitch ( also seats 6) which would make it easy to entertain friends or family in one spot. Overall just a gorgeous property and we will definitely come back! Aloha Jenofwaukesha,Mahalo for your review. We are delighted that you are impressed with all that our property has to offer. Our wonderful staff is trained to anticipate and accommodate any and all guest needs. We cannot wait to have you return to our gorgeous property to make more memories at Nanea!A hui hou (Until we meet again)",Good
"Picked the hotel because it was close to the start of the Columbia River Gorge. Very good stay. Not really close to amenities( Restraunts, bars, etc.) but all are not too far away to drive.

There was sliced ham, cheese omelets, waffles, oatmeal, muffins, fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, coffee, hot cocoa, milk and juice. The dining area was clean. We would stay here again.",Good
"My son and I stayed here one night to have a look at Tulane. We could see in advance that it was a good value. When we arrived, being Platinum, they offered us the opportunity to stay in a 3rd floor balcony room. What was also impressive is they alerted us in advance that it would be noisy and gave us the option to take a courtyard room. We decided, not getting to NOLA often, to get stay in the balcony room. We had a great view of the passers by and street entertainment all night and it was great that as we got hungry we could just walk out of the hotel and within a few blocks are some really good restaurants. We were there on a Sunday night and the drums were pounding loudly until 4 am. I learned two things from it 1) this hotel room came equipped with two sets of earplugs (which we did not use) and 2) I was so tired I slept ok even with all the noise.To sum up, very good staff, great location, good value. It is true that a Bourbon street-side room is not for everyone. If loud noise most of the night is a big problem, just ask for a courtyard room. But is you want the unique view of Bourbon Street, the balcony rooms give you the best view in the city. If you use the earplugs or noise cancellation, you will be fine.Thank you Havasupai123 for providing your feedback on your stay with us. We are so pleased to hear you and your son enjoyed your Bourbon balcony room. We greatly appreciate the perfect score. We hope to be your home away from home when your son selects his NOLA college.",Good
"I attended a conference for 4 days. The room was ideal for what I needed. The upgrade to a suite allowed for business to take place in my room without a bed in the middle. The bathroom was fantastic as noted by others. I enjoyed the fitness area, although a little confined relative to the size of the hotel and the fitness-minded Seattle population. The cab ride isn't bad and is under 50. I had colleagues that did the train for much less money and minimal trouble. Walking distance to great restaurants and the riverfront made the location very convenient.",Good

The breakfast is excellent and available from very early in the morning (Marty you could invest in a 4 slots toaster :-)) and the views of SF from the roof terrace are stunning. Also the location in the Mission district is ideal. We will certainly be back.Oh I almost forgot to mention the best part: if you are lucky you get to meet Marty (the owner and a fantastic person to chat) and Guppy, his adorable adorable little dog.A four slot toaster it is! Guppy loves you too. Thank you, Marty",Good

I don't like to have staff in my room during my stay so I can not comment on housekeeping other than to say the housekeeper was very friendly and took care of our towel and trash needs with a smile everyday. The elevators can be a drag since there are only two small ones but we just avoided the rush periods and were fine. I agree with other reviews in that we felt safe at all hours walking in the area.

"We've traveled from OR to IL and back w/ dogs, this was the best place we stayed. Great rooms, great price, sauna, bfast, can't beat it! Staff was really friendly, rooms clean, quiet, w/ wi-fi, fridge, microwave, and the same HBO TV as the speedy places.",Good
"I very much enjoyed my three night stay at the TownPlace Suites. I have stayed here a number of different occasions and have not been bothered by the trains even though i am a light sleeper My room large well planned out use of space, mini kitchen with full fridge, dishwasher, dishes and a small 2 burner stovetop electric range, and very clean, It was great. and Very comfortable Free internet that connected easily and quickly, no special codes required. They have a complimentary breakfast that was very good, pancakes, bagels, english muffins, various yogurts, oatmeal, coffee, tea, juices, milks, hot chocolate. easily accessible from the freeway with lots to do and see within walking distance. The staff very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend you stay here, there is shuttle stop right outside the door that takes you to downtown Disney, and other local attractions, best of all you can purchase tickets at the front desk of the hotel. Bottom line this is my hotel of choice when i stay in the area Love it and the staff.....",Good
"Hotel staff was very friendly! Room was clean and the bathroom was large and clean. Breakfast was very nice... hot and plentiful. The hotel is in an area not far from many stores, mall, big-box retail places... too far to walk but within 5 minute drive. While there we took a nice trip to Nay Aug Park. Overall, this was... More",Good
"This hotel surprised me. It was quite clean, and it was apparent that it had been renovated more recently than Marriott reported. The staff was very helpful. Very nice, clean indoor pool. Security guards in parking lot over the weekend.Thank you so much for your review, we are very pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us. We received several updates last summer, including paint, carpet, wall vinyl and new desk chairs. We did not perform a full renovation which is why the Marriott site will still show our last renovation in 2006. We encourage everyone to come and be suprised by the Fairfield Inn Suites Atlanta Buckhead, you'll be glad you did!",Good
"We checked in here for four nights before moving to our apartment in San Diego, this hotel is in hotel circle, so not many bars and restaurant are around, but its 20 mins walking distance to fashion valley, so if you love shopping, do take advantage of that! The Zacks bar in the hotel has happy hour every day from 4 to 7, we really liked that. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. We are also pleased to hear you liked the happy hour in our bar. Hopefully well welcome you back for a stay-cation or even just for happy hour. Thank you!",Good
"Overall I am satisfied with my 2 days stay at Hotel Rex. The location is perfect: close to everything at Union Square, China Town, etc. The lobby looks very nice. The room was reasonably clean. Given the location, the room was not too small. The stay was pleasant except the occasional noise during the day and sometimes during the night (we stayed a street-facing room at the third floor). The service was excellent. We arrived at noon, but was able to check in without any problem.",Good
"This Hotel offers great accommodations to events close to the Quarter. Because parking is so difficult, it offers the ability to walk to many shops and attractions. There was a jazz concert across the street. Excellent staff and great attitudes.",Good
"Room very very small, no view. Sink was clogged not enough towels when we arrived but was fixed right away when brought to your attention. A safe would have been nice. 655 for 2 days (includes valet parking) was pricey for what we are used to, otherwise we enjoyed our stay. Staff was excellent room nice clean. Great air conditioning.Thank you for staying at the River Hotel. We appreciate your candid feedback about your experience. I apologize for the issues you experienced initially, but am happy to know the team responded appropriately. Please know we have many room types and sizes available I hope you will book a larger room and try us again on your next trip.Thank you again!",Good
"I was drawn to this BB by the pic of the hall on its website. During my stay, the hall was not opened for any events. i did not have the chance to get a glimpse of the beautifully decorated event hall. The Bb is located in Backbay area-a safe district for females to walk alone in the evening. All the rooms are named after individual colleges decorated by different interior designers. I did not particularly like the decor of my tufts room-too masculine in feel. Nonetheless, the BB is unique in that it has a philanthropic mission. The college club awards scholarships to able needy students. Great place to stay in great chance to support needy students!",Good
We took a family trip to Atlanta. This is a very nice hotel with exceptional staff. Rooms were large with an excellent view of the downtown. Weekend rates are very reasonable. It is very convenient to MARTA right across the street.Thank you for bring your family to visit us at the JW Marriott Atlanta. We have a beautiful city and I am glad you were able to enjoy a skyline view. Being located across the street from the MARTA rail system is certainly convenient to many of our Atlanta attractions. I hope you and your family will plan to visit again.,Good
"The hotel staff was so helpful in making arrangements to meet our every need. Shuttle service is available every hour until 9 pm to most downtown sites such as Space Needle and Pikes Place Market. Room was very clean and breakfast buffet was fantastic. The onsite restaurant has wonderful food. We ate dinner there during our stay each day. I felt safe at this location. You will need to have the hotel arrange a ride to the pier if you are cruising. it was only 8.00 each for that ride. All other rides our group took was free with the hotel shuttle. Beds were comfy. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Would definitely recommend to others.I enjoyed reading about your great stay, Dana. It's always nice knowing when you enjoy everything from the shuttle to the restaurant. We really appreciate your recommendation!Safe travels,Frank F., General Manager",Good
"Very clean and comfortable room. The manager, Earnest, was helpful by introducing us to the hotel facilities and with the restaurants we liked in the Gallup, New Mexico area. The breakfast was very good as was our checkout. It was a very pleasant stay.Thank you for taking the time to comment, as it is a very useful tool in serving our guest. Thanks for staying with us, we enjoyed having you. Please come back and see us. Thank you and have a great day.",Good
"I've stayed in both the Residence Inn and the Springhill at this location. It's new and close to all of the water front attractions. Easy walk to downtown. Easy ride to the airport. Rooms are nice and have good views, no matter which way you face. Like the RI better because of the size of the room.Parking is obscenely expensive - be prepared.",Good
"We were looking for a place to basically spend a night before going to Sea World, a family party, and then on to another destination. This hotel definitely fit that bill.This property is easily seen from I8, but navigating to the actual hotel is a little bit of a challenge. The road sign is by a tree and is better seen coming from the opposite direction from the freeway offramp. We ended up taking a quick tour while looking for a good place to turn around.Upon our arrival, the front desk clerk was assisting another guest. While the wait was not very excessive, the clerk was apologetic for the inconvenience. He did an excellent job of telling us everything that we needed to know in order to maximize our stay.The rooms are small, but they feel new and comfortable. We found nothing that did not work as it was supposed to work, and the room was very clean when we arrived. The biggest challenge was that there is some sort of fog horn noise that can be heard throughout the night. I wondered if we were near to the trolley line or if it was a mechanical issue.The breakfast was nice, with waffles, muffins, and some other options available to guests.Overall, I would stay here again as long as it was the same type of stay - where I am not looking to be in the room for too long. Plenty of space and comfort for one night - but I'm not sure I would be pleased to stay here for much longer.Hi Clint A,Thank you for your review. We are located two turns off the freeway and it is difficult for some to find. I am glad that you were able to get to our location! We do offer other larger room types, such as the Non Smoking King Suite, that may be more suitable for a longer stay.Overall, It is good to hear we were able to provide you with a enjoyable stay. We hope to see you again soon!",Good
"Let me start by saying that I work 7 days a week but had a certificate here that I finally had a break to use. I highly recommend making reservations in advance since this is a smaller property and since it's so lovely, books up...More",Good
"This was a first visit but I will be back. I recently reviewed The Palace, and this was such a better experience. A great rate, a great location, staff was very helpful and accommodating. Joel (front manager) checked me in and his level of helpfulness and enthusiasm was impressive for a jaded traveler like me. The property is dated but charming, bed was one of the best I've had in a hotel in a while. Bath situation is a little cramped, street noise can be pretty significant, and food options are pretty limited (sushi only, best as I could tell, though I'm not a big user of room service). But the whole experience was very good and I intend to be go back. One petty note...the staff gave a good push for their Joy of Life Club and since I have stayed at a number of Joie de Vivre properties and liked them all, I decided to sign up. Enrollment was not particularly convenient, and it turns out they will only credit stays booked directly through their web site, yet my employer requires me to book through our corporate travel site...so all that trouble to enroll and I will probably never get any points. If you're going to use a club to encourage repeat visits, it ought to be easy and encouraging, not difficult and overly restrictive.Hello,We truly appreciate your feedback and I am glad that you enjoyed the hotel. We have forwarded your review to Joel as well. By your comments, it seems that our staff may have misinformed you on the types of bookings that can receive points. Any reservation booked directly through the hotel will recieve points. These eligible bookings also include some corporate travel sites that do not utilize a 3rd party prepayment method. We do not award points for 3rd party prepaid reservations such as Expedia, Hotwire, Hotels.com, etc. I am sorry for any confusion this caused. You have received your points for this stay already. If you have stayed at any other JDV properties in the last 30 days or so, I can also award points for those stays. Again, thank you for your positive review on TripAdvisor and your time. If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me directly. We hope to see you again soon!Warmest regards,Katie SpidellDirector of OperationsGalleria Park Hotel",Good
"Easy to get to from Interstate. Very good location for the front. Parking charge was reasonable and very useful. Good Amenities. The free full Breakfast was excellent and was one of the main reasons we booked this hotel as it gives you a good start to the day and saves having to find a place to eat in the morning so you can plan the day straight from leaving your hotel espescially if visiting the attractions.Excellent hotel rooms spacious clean and well kept.Dear Doc055, Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn. We are pleased that you enjoyed our breakfast and it was excellent for you. Thank you for sharing that our parking price is reasonable and how easy we are to reach from the Interstate. We are thrilled that you feel we have an excellent hotel with spacious rooms that are clean and well kept. Best Regards,Grace GerzenGuest Relations Manager",Good
"I found this wonderful boutique hotel as I was starting a cycle of business travel to San Diego - I will need to be there 3 or more days monthly for the foreseeable future. I am thrilled by the service, the scale (23 rooms), the rooms, the food (wow quality!), and of course the pet fish in each room. They don't take pets, but provide you with one - a beta fish swims in a bowl on the wall of the room!On Pt. Loma, just blocks from Shelter Island, The Pearl is perfectly accessible, has parking right at the entrances, and had a room where I was instantly comfortable. I was totally impressed with the restaurant - including Dive-In Theater playing movies on the screen over the pool, surrounded by the restaurant. As you look for that perfect little place from which to base your stay in San Diego - search no more you have found The Pearl of great value, and you don't have to sell everything to be able to afford it!",Good
The staff was excellent plenty of parking for a 5th wheel tralor good food close right off the 99 freeway rooms were up to date and clean,Good
"Dan at the desk was as usual very helpful, Gary the van driver was fun. They took us to the conference center and when done picked us up.The view from the room is SPACE NEEDLE. you pay a little more for the view but well worth it. Easy 2 blocks to the needle and Pacific Center. Good food within walking distance.johngraver,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge",Good
"The French Market Inn is a nice little hotel on the outskirts of the French Quarter. It is right down the street from Caf Du Monde and the French Market. I liked the location because it was easy to walk to the French Quarter, Harrahs, the trollies stops, etc., and quick access to Uber pickups and drop-offs was a plus. Rooms in the hotel facing the courtyard seemed fairly quiet our room faced Decatur St. and although there wasn't a lot of street noise, we did hear some trains passing in the middle of the night as the railroad tracks are nearby. We were in the French Quarter but removed from the noisy crowds and congestion.We booked what was supposed to be a deluxe room, and the first room we were assigned to was so tiny and dark I was certain we must have been given one of their mini-rooms. We called the front desk and were promptly offered another room. It wasn't very large, but compared to the first one we saw, this was fine for our needs. The room was attractively decorated and cozy. It was clean and comfortable, though I will say that there were some maintenance issues that could have been attended to--for example, the lamp shades and sockets on every lamp in our room were wobbly and askew and required some work to make them functional. It wasn't a difficult fix but the staff should be taking care of those sorts of things when they inspect the room. Our safe did not work, and the first guy they sent up to fix it didn't have a clue. It was the next morning before someone else came to work on it, and by then we had left the room to sightsee for the day so we weren't able to use the safe during our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. All in all, we had a nice stay and would stay there again if the price is right. It seemed to be a good value for the location.Thank you for your recent stay and taking the time to share your very detailed review. We appreciate your special mention of our friendly staff. Our apologies for the inconvenience you experienced. Please know that all of your comments have been shared with management. Overall, we hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans and we hope for an opportunity to welcome you back in the near future.",Good
"Wonderful staff, adorable rooms, great continental breakfast, perfect location, and all at a reasonable price. We were passing through town and stumbled upon this little gem. I would definitely stay here again.",Good
"Stayed for 3 nights and was very happy with the accommodation and service provided.Yes, there were renovations going on but we did not hear any noise or was inconvenienced at all. The workers took the rear service elevator (2R or 1R) and other than the faint smell of paint while passing the rooms being renovated, we hardly noticed any construction going on. All the information and amenities provided in the hotel website were accurate- great to do research ahead of time and know what is expected. The basics were all there: Clean hotel, professional staff, good communication and thoughtfulness (front desk remembered/addressed me by name during conversations from day 1-3).Pros: 1.Staff Hospitality and Friendliness- The staff that we met were all delightful and friendly. They engaged us in conversation and made us feel welcomed. Front desk Eimy and the night front desk person (Paul) was accommodating and helpful, so as the sous chef, housekeeping and restaurant staff, The genuine energy and hospitality from the staff was evident. Their courtesy and friendliness made us feel welcomed. We were consistently greeted with a hello and eye contact- the housekeeping staff, restaurant servers, front desk, facilities or construction workers that we meet in the lobby, hall way, elevator or restaurant, This may be basic service but truly made a difference during our stay,2. The shuttle service was excellent. Quick and friendly drivers (Terrance and Andreas). I called the front desk for a pick up and it took about 10 minutes for the driver to arrive at A 44 (the pick up location). After a red eye flight, this could not be any better.Throughout our stay, we used the shuttle to take us to the restaurants nearby, to an event location and of course to the airport. The shuttle service was a big bonus in this hotel. 3. Lobby- Clean, new furniture and nice modern decor. Very welcoming and comfortable.4. Rooms- Spacious, A/C worked well, nice comfortable bed, microwave, refrigerator and well appointed rooms (booked 2 rooms). The bathroom was quite small but clean. The bedroom and living rooms are separated. Requested a roll away bed (10) and it fit perfectly fine in the living room with the sofa bed, desk,and a chair, This hotel is a category 2 and going through renovation. It was clean, comfortable and functional. Areas of Opportunity:1. Breakfast menu selection- The food selection was quite limited, It is the usual fare (french toast, bread, bagel, eggs, sausage and bacon with fruit, oatmeal and cereal). Would be nice to have an omelet station. They do cook eggs to order and had scrambled egg whites with spinach on one of the days, Service was fast and friendly (provided beverages). The fresh fruit was not so fresh as it tasted sour and looked mushy. The server was informed and he took action immediately,Some tips:1.Hotel shuttle is available within 2 mile radius and covers about 25 restaurants -from fine dining to fast food, a mini-mart, and a souvenir gift shop. 2. The gas station closest to the hotel charges twice as much. If you need to fill the rental car before heading to the airport, the gas prices at the 7-Eleven is much cheaper.3. Super Wal-mart is about 7 minutes away and has every thing-food, clothes, souvenirs, pharmacy, party supplies, etc.. However, the hotel shuttle does not go there and have to use a private transport company or taxi, (costed us 24 round trip). 4. Transport to Downtown Disney or Epcot is 100 Round Trip. Van can accommodate 9 people. Just let the front desk know 30 minutes to 1 hour before to schedule pick up.",Good
"St. Regis are consistently luxurious and expensive. This one is no exception. Small lobby, but great service, beautiful rooms, great workout facility. It is a location that's not overly ideal for the touristy options (Wharf, bridge, china town), but if you want class and can afford it, this is the place.Dear JoesueFree ,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am pleased to hear that you had an exceptional experience at our hotel and that you enjoyed our fitness center and amenities.

"Our four person family - 2 adults and 2 kids, stayed here for a 4th of July staycation to be near the fireworks and Millenium Park. We were initially underwhelmed entering the small, dark lobby and small elevators- but wow, the rooms are fantastic! We had a light-filled king suite, with a full kitchen, spacious bathroom, living room and a lovely balcony! The service was very good the entire time- coffee at the (free!) breakfast was pretty good, the wifi worked and the beds were comfortable. The price was right, even on a busy 4th of July holiday, and the location is very convenient for Millenium Park/ Lakefront activities, as well as walking distance to the art museum, water taxis, or Michigan Ave shopping. This hotel is hands down the best value in the city.Dear jennifertF2691OZ,Thank you for your recent 5 star review. I am so thrilled that you enjoyed your stay! Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and to point out so many of the great things about the Comfort Suites Michigan Avenue!

Very happy to visit the Hampton. Easy check-in and check-out. The room was very clean so overall we were happy with our stay. Only real problem was that the business center PCs need fixed because the browser crashed continually during my attempts to do my airline check-in,Good
This hotel is well located with an easy walk (15 minutes) to the French Quarter and on the trolley line. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Service personnel are very gracious and helpful. Small coin laundry on the second level. Hot breakfast and snacks in the afternoon as well as popcorn and pop available in the lobby until 10pm. The only caveat is that the street side rooms are quite noisy as the trolley line passes on the street outside and seemed to run all night.,Good

"This is one of my favorite hotels to visit. It's a beautiful and tranquil property, with stunning views of the bay from every room I've stayed in. I typically travel to Miami for work and always prefer staying away from the craziness of South Beach. The Mandarin offers a respite from the rest of the city. The standard rooms are huge, with beautiful details, great bathrooms, and fantastic views from the balcony. The restaurant in the hotel is delicious, too. It is very pricey though - but worth it if you can splurge and want to stay outside of South Beach, for a different Miami experience.",Good

"What a lovely stay! This will be our go-to from here on out. The location can't be beat. The staff was always lovely and always ready to help. The valet service was always as prompt as they could be in a busy part of the city, and our car was well taken care of. The room was a little on the small side for two queen beds, but it wasn't too cramped and it suited us just fine. The decor was lovely and the bathroom was spotless. The beds were very comfortable and the A/C was super cold! The only downside to our stay was that our room was right by the elevator, and the WiFi was really spotty - some minutes it worked and other minutes it didn't. Still, though, we loved this hotel and look forward to a return trip (away from the elevators).We're pleased to hear you had a lovely stay at the French Market Inn and appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback about our historic hotel's service - please know all of your comments have been passed on to management.

"Being a Marriott it does have some great things to offer. I was disappointed that they had no airport shuttle. But being in the area it was located it was more of a family location than a business one. Rooms were not bad, comfortable. The outlets were worn out since many of my plug in devices had a problem staying plugged in. WiFi was good and I did not lose connection the entire stay. Only one elevator in the main building but it was fast enough didn't have long to wait. The nice thing about it was they did have a free bus service to local attractions, like Disney Land. Breakfast was so so, I am not a big cereal eater in the morning and that was the main food at breakfast. Again for family with kids this was a great place to stay.Hello and thank you for staying with us. Since we are so close to many of the local attractions in the Anaheim area typically we do get a lot of guests who are here for leisure stays. However our corporate guests are just as important to us. Sadly we do not have a shuttle to the airport, but we usually suggest the shared ride van through super shuttle as it is the most economical and the shuttle we most relay on. I will look into the outlets and follow up with our maintenance team to make sure this is corrected going forward. Thank you in assisting us with improving our hotel and reviewing us on trip advisor. We look forward to your next arrival with us.",Good
"We chose this hotel as it was convenient to get to the Atlanta Aquarium. We were impressed with all its features! The suite was reasonable in price, very clean, roomy, and had a very comfortable bed. We arrived in the evening. Lyneese was at the desk in the gorgeous, spacious atrium. She was so friendly. She microwaved a cup of water for me so I could have a hot cup of tea. She answered questions for us. The breakfast the next morning was exceptional and all foods were nice and hot (scrambled eggs, bacon one day and sausage the next). They had a pancake maker along with all the regular breakfast bread items plus fresh oranges and bananas.Dear Jan,Thank you so much for taking time out of your day, to review us and leave us such positive feedback following your recent stay with us.We are so pleased you enjoyed our hotel, from check in to breakfast, to our accommodating room set ups!I will pass on your kind words to Lynice, and we are happy to know she was helpful while you were with us.

"This is my first trip to San Francisco and therefore my first - but not last- say at the Rex, I'm back here is 4 days.This hotel was recommended to me by friends and they were spot on. I arrived here mid morning after a long flight from Australia and the wonderful desk staff let me into my room early, a quiet one at the back and very comfortable, room 404. They also helped me arrange some activities.I love wine hour at the bar, a free glass of wine, a chat to the barman and a read and relax. It's been a great way to unwind each afternoon.Good bed, great pillows, clean and with character. I'm looking forward to being back on Thursday.Thanks so much for the great review.

"Having tried to book a room at the W hotel in midtown only to find that it would run close to 500/might, we reserved at the Aloft which sits right next to the site of the new Georgia Dome. The Aloft is very similar to the W, but without some of the frills, which is fine when you save over 200. The rooms were quiet and self parking behind the hotel is secured and only 25, unlike some exorbitant valet fees you can be charged in the ATL. The rooms have complimentary coffee machines included as well as the Bliss bathroom amenities you find in the W. breakfast is self-serve, a-la-carte and offers hot prepared to order sandwiches for 6 - a nice break from the one-price buffet option that many lower cost hotels offer. I hope SPG continues to build these properties as we will seek them out in the future.",Good

"I chose Estancia LaJolla after reading the promising reviews on Trip Advisor it was one of the few with no negative reviews and I was not disappointed. Lovely and charming place, not like a typical hotel. Wine Flight with cheeses at Trintas wine bar delightul. The dinner at Mustangs Burros delicious. Love the pool and gardens. One minor downgrade is the fact that our room was not ready by 4:00 p.m. we strolled around waiting for desk to call our cell phone after I told them the number to call. After 45 minutes we went back to the desk and room was ready. When I arrived back at home I had a message that room was ready - they apparently called my home instead. Other than that miscommunication, our stay was first rate.Thank you for selecting Estancia La Jolla for your travels to Southern California. Your kinds words about how lovely and charming our resort is mean a great deal to our team. We look forward to your next trip to La Jolla and hope that we will be host to your next stay.",Good
Great place to stay. Excellent staff and customer service. We planned a last minute trip for our niece's spring break. We had never been to this hotel before but was pleasantly surprised.

The outdoor pool area was clean and well kept. The rooms were standard but very nice. The entire property felt very authentic with the local area. Also, having a restaurant right on property was very convienent. All of the local restaurants and shops were easily within walking distance. If we visit San Diego again we will definitely stay here!

"Visiting New Orleans on a Southwest vacations package booked from the UK, wanted to stay in the French Quarter so chose the Four Points. Great hotel and great location, the staff are very welcoming and check in is a doddle.My wife and I have just had a superb meal in the hotel dining room, why anyone would want to eat in the local bars when they can get a great value meal at the hotel beats me, decided to only have 2 courses, however the chef came out to ask us in we had enjoyed our meal and convinced us to try the creme brulee, glad he did as it was to die for, if you are booked into this hotel check the menu out, enjoy dinner then enjoy all that Bourbon Street has to offer.Dave UKDave.

"As per previous reviews, we also encountered closure of the outdoor bar for a private event. We only stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and primarily chose this hotel because of this amenity. The rates are not cheap, and it is quite disappointing to be turned away to go sit in a downstairs restaurant bar instead. The rooms are nice, clean--beds are a bit firm for my taste. Enjoyed the complimentary wine in the evening. Breakfast was good when we used the facility. the location can't be beat...close to bars and restaurants, and the bay walk. Valet parking is 40 a day...pretty high. would recommend hotel once they get the private event closures under control..Dear Susan S.Thanks for your feedback about your recent stay with us. I'm very happy to hear your kind words about our facility and the location certainly can't be beat! I did want to acknowledge your frustration about the event being held at our deck. As you can imagine, it's quite a popular space. Due to its large size we're normally able to section off part of it for private events so that all of our guests can enjoy the area. I appreciate the feedback about what you encountered and want to apologize. We'll make sure that we're cognizant about the best use of the area. Thanks again and I hope you can make it back soon.

"My husband and I stayed here 3 nights in May 2011 after a cruise. The staff was friendly and helpful, and our room was comfortable, spacious and clean. The building has old-style class and charm. When we reserved we requested a small refrigerator with a freezer unit (to re-freeze cooler pack for my husband's insulin) it was present when we arrived, but not freezing properly -- it was fixed promptly and worked fine the rest of our stay. The breakfast buffet was much nicer than average and includes do-it-yourself waffles. (Make sure to get to the breakfast within the stated hours -- they are serious about shutting down on time.) The free drink and snack time each evening was a nice perk, though we were only present for it once -- too many other things to do in the area! The rooftop pool and hot tub looked great, but the weather was a little too cool to make use of them while we were there -- go up for the area view even if you don't want to have a soak.",Good
"My husband and I were in Orlando for a Disney Run, which I did for a local charity. That charity choose where we stayed our first 2 nights in town, which was Carribean Beach Resort at Disney. Our second room, at Hampton Inn near Sea World FAR surpassed the Disney room. We booked early and were able to reserve the king room with wet bar. The room was huge, plenty of space. The bed was extremely comfortable. My only advice is to bring your own pillow if you are used to using a firm pillow. The hotel provides extra pillows if needed, but they go flat quickly. Yes, there is construction going on next door (both sides) of the hotel - and yes, you can hear it. I am a light sleeper, but I was still able to sleep in even with the construction going on. FYI - it starts around 7am. Unless you plan on sleeping very late for most of your trip, this should not be a deterrent for you to book this hotel. Most days we slept until after 8am without a problem. The front desk staff of the hotel went above and beyond for us. There was an issue with the credit card I booked with, and they were very understanding. In addition, I want to give a special thank you to Aaron. He gave us advice about Universal which saved us both time and money. He was awesome!! If you are looking for any theme park advice, ask for him. Those of you on the fence about booking this hotel - have no fears. We are picky and we loved it here. Book away!!",Good

The second room not only had a sink that didn't work, it was full of filthy black water. Gross!!! We were moved to a third room with a sink that didn't work very well, but we were so tired of moving we decided to deal with it. We came back from dinner and found no wine and it was brought up only after we had called. The final straw was the lack of room cleaning. The maid service didn't stop by despite our calls for 2 days and would only pick up towels and most days cleaning service didn't show up until 4-5 in the afternoon. Trying to bill this Best Western as upscale is a joke. The service was unacceptable and they deseperately need to work on their house keeping and sink issues.",Bad

"We stayed at this hotel for one night before leaving on a cruise to Alaska. Let me start by saying we are HUGE Marriott fans, and have always had extremely pleasant stays at the majority of properties. Sadly, this particular Marriott may be independently owned or at the very least poorly managed which resulted in us having a horrific stay. We booked four rooms in total for our group. My family had two of the rooms. We returned after a wonderful dinner at a nearby restaurant and went to our room about 10:00 pm, with our main objective being a good night's sleep so that we were ready to leave for our cruise bright and early. Imagine our surprise when the room next door had a barking dog in it. No people...just a barking dog. We called the front desk and they apologized and told us they were so sorry that this was happening. They told us that this was a service dog which was why he was allowed in the room. They then went on to say that they had the same problem the night before, had spoken to the guests and the guests assured them they would not leave the dog alone again in the room. (So this begs the question why does someone need a service job if they don't take them out with them If a person needs a service dog, shouldn't the dog be with the person.) Aside from that, however, management knew they had a pesky situation and didn't deal with it. EXCUSE ME They knew this was a problem, they assigned a person to the room next door anyway REALLY Management came up, knocked on the door, no answer, just a barking dog who was now really agitated. This barking continued until 1:00 in the morning. We called the front desk again and again. They couldn't do anything about it as the guests were not home. The hotel was full so changing rooms was not an option and why should we have to move anyway In the morning we found breakfast for all four of our group's rooms slid under the door. Sorry--we had made plans to go to Pike's Market to explore and have breakfast before getting to the ship for our cruise. We requested a refund of points for the one room we booked on points and requested a refund for the cost of the other room. The manager informed us he was not authorized to refund our money or points. We dealt with Marriott Rewards to get our points refunded however, we were not ever able to get a refund of our cash account as the manager felt the breakfasts equalled the cost of our room---however since we didn't use the breakfasts we were not compensated at all. So why even give them one star They recommended a wonderful restaurant nearby that our entire family enjoyed. I will return to Seattle, I will NEVER stay in this hotel unless I hear that new management has taken over.Dear Guest,Thank you for spending the time to share your experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union.

"Old motel style , recently remodelated but dirty, stinky , stains in the linnens, 1000 year old mattress , expensive ,just not worth it .Dear recent guest,I'm sorry to read your review and hear that you did not enjoy your stay in one of our poolside/putting green area rooms. Although these are only 2-story buildings with exterior access, most of our guests enjoy the patios and balconies these rooms have overlooking the golf putting green or the swimming pool. There are, however, 2 rooms in those buildings that do not have a balcony. I would like to follow up on your stay to check the room and check the mattress. All of our rooms throughout the entire hotel had new premium, Sealy Celestial Plush mattresses put in them, so I would like to go in and check your mattress to see if it needs replacing. I have also forwarded your comments regarding the linens to our Executive Housekeeper. I would really appreciate if you could reply to me at salesholinnbayside.com with your guest room number, or your name and dates of stay, so that we can further investigate this and make sure the next guest doesn't share the same experience.Thank you",Bad

"We have stayed at this property for years and loved it, but noticed that it was going downhill over the past couple of years. After our last stay, we were so disappointed that we decided to try a new property for our next vacation. Based on our last stay, we have the following comments: * Pool area: Very few lounge chairs, most of which are broken. This is not a new problem...it has been ongoing for years. Smoking is allowed in the enclosed pool area, which poses a health and safety hazard especially for small children. During our last stay, there was a man that parked himself at one of the tables all day and smoked cigars. Since we were travelling with our 1 year old, we asked if he wouldn't mind refraining from smoking while we were with our infant, but he continued to smoke. Since smoking is allowed in this area, the hotel chose not to take action. After moving, we were still in the path of the smoke, plus another guest chain smoking cigarettes. There is a seating/table area just outside of the enclosed pool area that would be better if guests need to smoke. Perhaps management could consider making the enclosed pool area non-smoking, replace the broken lounge chairs and offer more seating. The pool itself was great, clean and child friendly.* Evening meal: This was the most noticeable decline. Almost every night offered a meal with cheese, with no alternative for those allergic or lactose intolerant. We had individuals in our party, along with other hotel guests who were unable to participate in the evening meal due to allergies. Previously, whenever the entree offered cheese, the salad bar was a garden salad with a variety of add-ons (including cheese on the side). The salad bar has since disappeared. During our last two stays, both the entre and salad contained cheese and was offered at least 3 times per week. It would have been nice to return to the hotel and enjoy a casual meal with our family and other guests after a long day out. Since you're provided with a menu for the week, we knew in advance when we had to eat out or pick-up dinner. Perhaps management could consider limiting the cheese entrees to once or twice a week (as in previous years) and offering a salad bar and breadsticks (without cheese).* Breakfast: In previous years, the hot breakfast was very good with variety on a daily basis, but would now consider it between average and poor. The variety has declined with the same offering on consecutive days. When cheese eggs and grits were offered, there was no substantial alternative. We've also noticed that Styrofoam plates were often substituted for real plates over the past couple of years at both breakfast and the evening meal.On the positive side, the hotel is in a great location. We loved that it was away from the busy areas and offered a quiet stay. The rooms are large and for the most part clean. The furnishings have seen better days, are not terribly comfortable and small for a family, but okay for the amount of time spent in the room. The staff was great - at check-in and breakfast.We will miss the Homewood, but can no longer justify staying at this property. The cost has also increased over the years although the cost to include meals may be used to justify the price increase, it wasn't worth the additional cost (as per above) as the meals lacked variety, did not consider allergies/intolerances and were overall substandard. We just returned from our vacation at the new property and have to say that we will not be returning to the Homewood. The new property was fabulous - larger suites, the pool area was clean and spacious with a significant amount of seating and the entire complex was non-smoking. We felt that we spent our vacation at a resort and were pampered. The best part is that we saved over 30 per night in comparison to the Homewood for the same time period.",Bad

They must be miserable with their lives, but they should not take their misery out on customers. This hotel is located in one of the prime areas in Atlanta, near a few big corporations, and it's unfortunate that you have these classless women, who are both extremely unprofessional working at the front desk at this particular location. They are a bad representation of your company -- no class at all. Two bad apples ruins the bunch. I give this place two stars.

"Please DO NOT book this place. As soon as I got there, I felt scared. However, I couldn't leave because I couldn't find an affordable place due to a convention going on. I thought that I would spend all day doing tourist stuff, and just come here to sleep, but it was a nightmare! There are a bunch of homeless people, drunk, high, suspicious etc around the area. I'm from a country with the highest crime in the World and I have been in many cities, but I have never felt so scared. There are trash bags in the stairs and they smell like pee. The rooms smell like weed and smoke furthermore, the smell of cleaning chemicals were worst. I didn't see bed bugs however, there were hairs in the sheets. It feels like they never changed them. The shower didn't work. I heard two men next to our bedroom having loud sex. I saw 3 transsexual men in the room downstairs in underwear.

"Sure - its a boutique hotel with a great location and offers complimentary breakfast. But Ive never encountered issues like this before in all my extensive travels. My check-in and check-out each took over 10 minutes, blaming slow computer issues while I watched guests being served faster at the adjacent desk. At check out, the front desk couldnt even print my folio so I could review and approve the charges. The hotel is made of two buildings if youre in the second building its just across a small patio. However this patio is used as the hotels staging area for extra linens and especially the dumpsters. So every time we needed to reach our room, we had to walk through horrific trash odors. On this trip, I booked two rooms. Upon arrival, The first rooms toilet wouldnt flush which means 1) it didnt flush for the cleaning crew and 2) the cleaning crew did noting to report and repair. When we came back to the room after the repair, toilet water was everywhere all over the floor and the maintenance guy used one of our towels to drag around the floor and left it in the bathroom. GROSS. In the second room, on our first night I pulled down the bedsheets and was appalled to find a lot of food crumbs and hair from the prior occupants. It was quite evident. GROSS. When I called the front desk, the staff informed me that no one else was available to change our bedding. She had a formal response but I could tell shes just going through the motions. So I asked for new sheets to change it myself. I do commend the hotel manager for calling me back the next morning, sounding genuinely concerned, and offering other incentives to rectify the cleanliness issue. But at this point, the hotel staff doesnt reflect the same professionalism or attitude, and I know we wont be returning here.Thank you for your feedback. On behalf of our hotel, please accept my apologies for failing to exceed your expectations regarding the check-in and out process, poor service, and lack of cleanliness. These are things we must work on to ensure we continue to provide an exceptional stay experience for each guest. We appreciate the honest feedback and hope you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations on a future visit.",Bad
"Weve stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel a hand full of times over these past 10+ years. It's a nice quaint property. My wife and I were booked to stay there this last weekend (6/29-7/1/2018). However, upon confirming our reservation online last week, I noticed that a new Urban Amenity Fee fee was added and my new stay total was increased by almost 50. I was not contacted when this fee was imposed. I inquired as to what additional amenities this fee would be providing, above and beyond what was already offered at the hotel. Unfortunately, the General Manager Suzie Yang didn't feel it was necessary to respond. So, I cancelled and will not patronize this property again. It seems San Francisco boutique hotels feel their properties are worth the extra fee. Why not just raise the daily rate instead of adding deceitful fees We, instead, booked at the Hilton Union Square on O' Farrell Street. The Hilton was not only less expensive, they don't charge this ridiculous and underhanded Urban Amenity Fee. The Hilton has MANY more amenities and is actually located closer to Union Square. There are a multitude of restaurants and bars in the area, unlike the Galleria Park.Dear David S,We are deeply saddened to hear the Urban Amenity Fee has caused you to make the decision to stay elsewhere. We instituted this fee with the new year 2018 as a means to provide extra benefits for our guests.The 20 nightly charge allows us to deliver far behind the included amenities from the past. With our nightly sipping hour, we have introduced the service of gin martinis on top of the wines, WiFi access has been upgraded to higher speeds for all guests, all local and long distance phone calls are now available with no extra per usage costs, we now have phone chargers as well as portable power banks for our guests to utilize during their stay, water bottles are now provided without the high cost of the mini bar, and we now have passes available to be used at the 24 Hour Fitness studio. Our belief is to be transparent regarding this fee, which is why we disclose the added cost for our guest at the time of booking, in the confirmation email and once again reiterated at the time of check-in.We hope you will reconsider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you back to San Francisco.With warm regards,Jeffrey RosenkrantzAssistant Front Office Managerjrosenkrantzjdvhotels.com",Bad

Half an hour later i called the front desk and the phone rung for about 20 or more times until someone decided to pick up. Then i had to explain that i had went to the office and no one had came to the room and brought the coffee maker to me yet and finally after another 5-10 mins of waiting they came and gave it to me. It was not a good experience at all. The only reason i got the room was becasue i had to be at the airport early in the morning, mind you that i did not get there to check in until 930pm.",Bad

"We were supposed to stay here on September 30, 2012, but we had to change our plans. I canceled the reservation on August 20th and got a confirmation email about the confirmation. I was well within the 72 hour cancellation time period so that I would not be charged as a no show. I found out a couple of days ago that they charged my card anyway. I forwarded the confirmation email to them and asked them why they charged me, the general manager wrote back that he did the research, and because the reservation was never cancelled on their end, it wasn't considered cancelled, and I was being charged as a no show. He did, however offer me a credit towards a one night stay if I come to Napa in the next two years, which I won't. Needless to say, I'm disputing the charge with my bank.",Bad

"I have stayed at this Drury Inn every other year when I visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras Season. This year was no different... To make a long story short- Drury Inn charged me for two rooms but failed to let me know that upon arrival or checking in the hotel (I had apreviously called the hotel to cancel the reservation FYI). After I noticed the charge on my account I called and spoke with the manager Patrick to reverse the charges. He was super rude, loud talking over me, and had an I dont care attitude. He stated that he would fax in the necessary paperwork to my bank as they requested via email.( that was a Sunday) Monday went and still no funds-Tuesday came and still no funds. At this point my automatic withdrawals started to come out of the account. Which enabled my account to go in the negative and it set a domino effect. I checked in on Saturday and my bank froze my account due to suspicious fraud so I wasnt able to get any money off my account (but it didnt matter because Drury Inn had it all wrap up). Tuesday before I left I spoke with my bank and they told me they never received the proper paperwork so I went to the front desk and spoke with Jaime and she faxed the proper info over for me. Not even 30 minutes later my bank called me and said they received the paperwork and the funds are credited to my account. Now on to the housekeeping- our room had not been cleaned the entire time we were there- which was a Saturday through a Tuesday. Yes the trash was emptied and the beds covers had been pulled over( which I had an issue with because the first day the sheets I had had urine stains on them) after I returned back to the room I asked if someone could come change my sheets. When I returned I asked the front desk if it was taken care of and they stated yes (what they didnt know is that I put a quarter in the middle of the bed under the covers). When I came to the room it was still there. The entire I was there no one vacuum the floor and I had to call everyday to ask for towels - the minimum required towels was not left in my room after cleaning it. I had a few questions and concerns for the manager Patrickbut he blew me off, loud talking me, his exact words were you did this so deal with it. Tuesday morning I attempt email to contact the manager Slade about the situation just to let him know that my bank stated they never received the authorization to reverse funds but he never called me back and I called him at 8:22 am. Yes I went down to the front desk and Jaime took care of it but he was avoiding me because he did not want to handle the situation. His exact words were you would have to call Patrick because he knows the situation and I dont have anything to do with it since he already knows the story. The crazy thing is I actually love this hotel but I wont ever be staying here again when I come to New Orleans. Talk about unprofessional and unable to handle a situation! By the way if I could give a negative 22 on the score I would. All weekend I was suppose to be enjoying the festivities for my birthday but I had to continuously run up behind Drury Inn for answers. What if I didnt have any cash on me how was I going to be able to get back home Im so disgusted by it ALL.",Bad

"Although the lobby of the hotel is nice, beyond that is a dated, tired hotel. We arrived earlier than check-in so went up to the pool deck. Lounge chair covers were stained in the private seating areas. Main deck chairs were old and dingy. Cigarette butts from the night before were still on the pool deck. Check in finally came at 3:30. There were over 55 people in line waiting and two people behind the desk checking us in. When we finally got our room in the Annex, we quickly turned around and went back down to the lobby to change it. First off, the elevator to the Annex is behind the desk of the diner and it looks like it was once the service elevator. We heard the Annex had been an old Holiday Inn. The hallway lights were partially burned out, the carpet was frayed and dated and the room smelled like disinfectant and the carpet was damp (don't know with what). The wall had a hole in it the dresser drawer was cracked and falling apart and the bathroom tiles were broken in spots. Our next room had a nice balcony with a view of the spa pool in the same worn out Annex. The spa pool was dirty and were were told that someone had thrown a glass bottle into it a couple of days back and they were waiting for a diver to come and take out the pieces of glass so they could clean it. The room didn't smell but the sliding door to the balcony was off the track so it wouldn't open and the wall had a missing large picture (someone had painted around it at one point and you could see the outline of the picture) and there was a large hole in the wall that had been covered up with electrical tape. The only bright spot was Bob, the maintenance person, who brought us a painting to cover the wall and fixed our door. Obviously the hardest working man at the Chelsea! All in all, the worst hotel room I've ever stayed in and will never return to the Chelsea. I live outside of Philadelphia and travel to Atlantic City a lot. This was my worst trip to date.",Bad
"The front desk staff was wonderful and as helpful as can be. This was especially true, when our room had mold on the windows and drapes and smelled of damp. We were immediately moved to the only other available room, which, unfortunately also had mold (this time in bathroom) and damp. It was supposed to be a more expensive room because it overlooked St Charles Street, which under cover of night seems to have lots of inebriated individuals and street pharmacists doing business. We couldn't use the elevator for a short time after the ceiling fell in on another guest and had to be repaired. The bed was comfortable and would have contributed to a good nights sleep except for the damp smell. Both the room we started with and the room we eventually slept in were a bit small for two twin beds and a family of four with teenagers.The staff made sure the rest of our four-night reservation was cancelled and let us keep our car in the secured parking lot while we explored the French Quarter the next day even after we had checked out. They were helpful despite our unpleasant stay due circumstances beyond their control. Because of the helpfulness and friendliness of the front desk staff, I wish that I could give this hotel a higher rating, but as we could not even stay past the first night of our reservation (and then only because it was late and dark and we had no other place to go), I could not recommend this hotel.David,I'm very sorry we did not exceed your expectations during your stay. The issues you encountered have been addressed by housekeeping. We have rooms with two double beds and one king bed. I'm sorry the room with two double beds seemed small for your family.

"Stayed here in the Spring of 2012. The location is great for walking around the Old Town area, and conveniently located to drive most places in San Diego. I think this place has a bit of arrogance in the way their run their business, though. When we arrived to move into our room with bay views, we got shoveled in a dirty, smelly room in the far upper corners of a building facing a park. I called the office and asked why we were paying for a bay view and got this room. We had to haul our luggage back down to the parkade and drive all the way back to the office to talk to them. They seemed quite upset that we were questioning the room we got they tried again with a room directly across from the stairwell facing a wall, but we refused that room as well. Their third try was this is the last room we have, which we took. It did face the bay, but was a corner room with the stairwell right in front of the door, which made it a little noisy when people's children were running up and down the stairs and breezeways. It was quite a big larger than the first room they tried to put us in, though. When I asked why we didn't get the room we had booked months in advance, the response was we're full. Huh Stay was OK because we didn't have to engage with the staff again until we checked out. Lots of steps and climbs up and down the road if you're in the upper buildings. Restaurant staff on the arrogant side as well. Must be catchy at this hotel! Parking is horrible - don't bring anything bigger than a Ford Fiesta! Wouldn't stay here again. Sadly, they have a great location, but really indifferent, slightly arrogant, almost rude staff. I'd head for Coronado next time!",Bad

We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor.

"I decided, since I was dining at Scalini's and attending an Il Divo concert at the Cobb Energy Center, to stay nearby at the Renaissance versus driving home. In addition, I would meet with friends for brunch on that side of town the next afternoon. When I attempted to use the shower the next morning, I encountered a dollar-sized dark brown spider. Upon checkout, I mentioned my difficulty to the desk clerk whose attitude was dismissive. No one else was in line. After all, one thinks if there is one spider, there must certainly be others. I did receive a sorry, see ya next time response from the General Manager based on a hotel-based review. That does nothing after not having the ability to use the room as anticipated, not to mention my fear of spiders, especially the brown recluse spider. Please excuse me for having a reasonable expectation of being able to bathe without incident before going to Sunday Brunch. This incident made an otherwise pleasurable stay become a disaster. Also, I had intentions of using the hotel shuttle for my evening liaisons but was discouraged by the valet because there was a possibility of being disappointed with one van and 500 guests.I am very sorry about your experience and would like to discuss this with you in more detail.

"Now like most reasonable people whove traveled a lot, we understand when you make a special request, motels cant always meet them. Were okay with that.What were not okay with is when motel proprietors make up silly excuses to avoid honoring advertised claims. And were also not okay with being threatened with refusal of service. Thats exactly what happened to us here.This was to be our 36th hotel stay in almost six months of travel across North America, and our first experience with the Motel 6 chain. It will also be our last.We booked a week prior to our stay through the Motel 6s national website, requesting a room with a fridge in our booking comments. The national (mobile) website lists an amenity for this motel as Free microfridge/some rooms. We received a confirmation booking email from Motel 6, showing our rate and our request.We read the statement Free microfridge/some rooms as some rooms (not all), have free mini-fridges. On check in, we were presented with a credit card charge that exceeded the amount in our confirmation email. On querying the difference, it was firstly explained as sales tax. Now whilst we mightnt be actuaries, even we could see the difference far exceeded any sales tax value and on querying further it became obvious there was a charge for the fridge. Sometimes misunderstandings and miscommunications occur. And were reasonable people willing to overlook issues if theres a valid explanation or compromise. This motel refused to honor the free part of the statement, offering that to us for an additional charge and suggesting that as it wasnt their personal website, there was no obligation on them to do so. The comedy routine got better though.We were asked for and provided evidence of our booking, and of the statement on the Motel 6 website (it was more a demand as in what website says that). The gentleman we dealt with was not prepared to compromise on this point however. He was insistent on making his point, which simply was that the rate in his computer system for rooms with fridges, was a higher rate.That he was rude, threatening and unwilling to compromise on such a minor point, and with such unreasonable excuses made us wonder if we were on one of those reality comedy shows you know the ones where people are deliberately rude and antagonistic, and then the camera crew rushes out and surprises you and everyone laughs. We saw no camera crew however and the comedy routine continued with him suggesting we cant just give things away. In our view, and for most other reasonable people, failing to honor advertised claims amounts to misleading and deceptive conduct. Giving an unreasonable excuse to disassociate a chain-branded property from its national brand simply to avoid honoring a small commitment demonstrates a lack of integrity. We also contacted Motel 6s national office via their website about our issue. On the first occasion they misread our concern, seeing it simply as being we asked for a fridge and didnt get one. On the second occasion, we received exactly the same worded, trained-monkey, form-letter response including (the almost condescending): the experience as you described, concerns us deeply. And the promised action on both counts Well send your comments to our Management Team for their review. Interpreted as were not going to do anything with your comments but hey, thanks for wasting your time and effort!We dont appreciate or accept this type of behaviour, and chose to take our business elsewhere. And were no longer waiting for the camera crew to appear.",Bad

"What a disappointing stay- fell far below expectations, which weren't so high to begin with. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. Otherwise, I found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.The room was comfortable and generally fine, in terms of condition, apart from the surprising lack of a safe! Having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. The room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. Surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingBut my biggest beef was the breakfast, which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. Two of the three mornings, there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. The overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.",Bad
"This property is nice and clean in an off the beaten path area of Seattle. If you're trying to book a room with a corporate rate, beware. I've been staying here just about every week for the last 9 months, and they still blackout corporate rates every chance they get. They refuse to honor customer loyalty, and make booking rooms here consistently impossible. They like to charge you more for the executive level, which is a load of garbage because they're just rooms at the top of the hotel with free cereal and water bottles. I'll be glad when I don't have to stay at this property anymore, just because of how difficult they make the booking process. I've had to stay outside the city and drive over 1 hour each way because they refuse to honor corporate rates at random times. The staff isn't great. it's almost like they have this attitude that they're a top of the line luxury hotel in Seattle, which isn't the case. Definitely wouldn't recommend this property to business travelers.

Why couldn't the hotel have purchased juice and placed them in pitchers to refill or purchase more small cans of juice The breakfast items were not re-stocked regularly even though there was someone in the area working.Upon check-out we found out that our young children had ended up going to a pay channel and we were charged for a movie that they did not know they were paying for (they just click the buttons) and did not watch in in its entirety. The manager would only credit one of two charges as it was only on for something like 5 min. Upon receiving my credit card bill, the charge was never reversed. There was ZERO goodwill. They should also have warning signs about in room tv charges or upon check-in with young children, ask the customers if they would like the tv purchases locked out.The two bedroom was cramped, but we managed to survive the three nights.Thoroughly disappointed and will stick with Staybridge Suites from now on and pay the little bit extra instead of the Marriott.Thank you for reviewing us on Trip Advisor. It is unfortunate that we did not meet your expectations. Our goal is to make sure that our guests are aware of the type of amenities that we offer. Our Continental breakfast offers several items from six types of cereals, muffins, bagels English muffins, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, a waffle station, and juice. We apologize that during your time with us we had an issue that was out of our control and the preventative maintenance service on our equipment failed due to an internal part malfunction. This issue has been corrected and we now have a new juice machine which was replaced quickly after this time frame. For future guest arriving with small children you can request to have all movies turned off in your suite to avoid this issue as movies watched past a certain amount of time cannot be removed. Just ask a friendly front desk agent at your time of check in and they will be happy to adhere to this request. We did try and assist you in removing as many of the movie items as we could. Thank you again for staying with us and we would love another opportunity to improve upon your last visit. Thank you for again for staying.",Bad
I booked a 7 night adventure for my family thru Expedia but I had to change plans cause our dates were conflicting. I had cancel current reservation on March 21.

"Stayed at The Annex for a night. Room key did not work after we checked I had to walk all the way down to front desk to get another. Room was clean but had a moldy smell about it, I would have left if I had another place to go. The worst part about this hotel is that I put my credit card down to hold the room and upon checking out took care of the stay in cash. Charge was removed from credit card, 2 weeks later charge shows up again and my bank processed it The hotel has been unresponsive and bank will not take the charge off my card I never stay at this hole again.",Bad
This place is overall disgusting. I used a whole can of roach spray the first night. The staff act as if you're infringing on their time when maintenance is needed. Stay away from this roach-infested crack house.,Bad
This hotel has tiny rooms and gross bathrooms. 5 days after staying there and I am sick as a dog. I cant help but feel I may have gotten diva'd. Do not stay here unless you are desperate. I have stayed in over 20 hotels in SF and this is by far the worst. Very close to a hooker hotel.Thank you for the feedback on your stay. We apologize your visit was less than excellent.

"Over the years I have stayed at numerous Hamptons and been generally satisfied, but not now.We stayed at this Hampton for two nights. Somehow we got into a handicap room. The room was sparsely furnished with only one desk style chair no place to put a suitcase and hooks behind a curtain for a closet. The first issue was the heater which we set at 69 degrees. We went to bed early and at 11 PM woke up sweating to a temp of 84 degrees. Obviously the thermostat did not work. The handicap shower has a vertical slide to hold the shower head but it would not stay at the top nor would the sprayer stay vertical it would flop down. The real issue was a total lack of housekeeping when we returned on the second day. A coffee cup with an inch of coffee was still on the nightstand along with the ice bucket full of water and the bag half in the bucket. I had left it in front of the TV with the lid off so they could see it but they did not move it. In the bathroom there was a little powder on the floor from the morning which was still there, obviously they did not sweep or mop the floor. But the coup de grace was the toilet paper floating in the toilet. That was disgusting, they never touched the toilet to clean or someone used it while we were gone. Overall the hotel was noisy with trains going by during the night an you could hear voices from the lobby. The breakfast was mediocre with a small breakfast area. Look for a better place to stay then here. When I mentioned the issues to the desk clerk she took my number and said the manager would call. Now 72 hours later no call, what does that tell youThank you so much for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. Your feedback we truly appreciate as it helps us to make the necessary improvements. We truly apologize that we did not meet your expectations during your stay with our service. Every day is a learning experience for us and we strive for excellence daily. I would like to hear more about your recent experience.

"I've stayed in many budget hotels over the last 20 years including other Motel 6 motels. Half the lights did not work in the room, the room was dirty and the elevator did not work. I was there on business and they tried to double the price of the room from the confirmed reservations price that I had in writing. One light bulb in the entire room was working and the room smelled of urine and dog.Dear Guest, Thank you for sharing your post. Motel 6 standards for quality rest on our promise to offer the lowest price of any national chain by delivering the essential elements of a comfortable room for a satisfying stay, for this reason we apologize for the disappointment you describe with the expectations of our housekeeping cleaning of the guestroom.

"I had stayed there before and gave them a positive review. However, when I went back, they had changed management. The staff is very negative, incompetent, and nasty. There is no shortage of drama.

"The floor were so dirty our feet were black within minutes of walking into the room and kicking our shoes off, there was urine on the toilet seat and long black hairs in and on the bedding. The bed was hard as a rock so if you like sleeping on bricks that will be awesome for you. Oh and if you're going to seaworld and want the discounts etc you have to walk next door to a sister hotel but they are only available from 7am-10p.

"This is the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in!!! The price was good, but a little too good to be true. They charge you not only for your stay but also a resort fee and if your room is not ready by the time you get there and you'd like to leave your luggage, they also charge you for that! The pictures on the website are extremely deceiving. The outside looks nice but the closer you get you can tell just from the outside of the building that your in for a trip. The staff was not that nice, rude actually. When my boyfriend and I had gone back to the lobby, the lady told me to hold on a second so she could finish her text messaging.......The room was disgusting. Neither of us could walk around without anything on our feet. The bathroom had a ton of cracks and was also 4 different colors. The shower did not drain well at all and when you close the bathroom door, the crack was so big between the door frame and the door, I could see the other room perfectly. The only reason why we continued our stay here was because every hotel was booked around us. We weren't in the room for a half hour yet and we were both on the phone trying to find another hotel.The pool was terrible, no lighting around it what so ever at night. Another guest had to switch their room 4 times due to the air conditioners not working in any of those rooms. Also, pizza flyers were VERY ANNOYING!!! 2am and you hear someone at your door, sounding like trying to break in, but just sliding the flyers under the door.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Bad

"It may look decent outside, but the rooms are not that great. The bathroom and room smells bad. Had to buy an air freshner because it was so bad. The water smells bad too. Queen size bed and one sofa, and there's a wall barrier between bed and sofa (odd). The breakfast bar was not good. There's a pool, it's okay. And the jacuzzi was out of service. Ice machine out of service.It is unfortunate that you and your family encountered many issues that made your stay less then satisfactory. All of your concerns have been addressed with my staff with the exception of our spa. Unfortunately there is never a good time to remodel, however our spa is in the process of being resurfaced. It is not the norm of our hotel to fall short on so many areas. I apologize on behalf of myself and my staff and will make sure our future guests do not experience the same areas of concern as you did.Sincerely,Best Western Management",Bad
"Being both a Marriott Rewards Platinum Member and Hilton HHonors Diamond for me means that I spend over 200 nights a year in hotels, it has also given me a keen insight into what makes for a perfect hotel stay. Unfortunately the Renaissance Waverly Hotel in Atlanta falls short of delivering even an acceptable hotel stay. When I arrived at the hotel there was no bellman available to assist me with luggage. There was a line at check in with only two people at the front desk. The line moved slowly but when my turn came I was greeted nicely and welcomed as a Platinum Elite. I was also grated my requested upgrade. The suite that I had was nice although the furnishings and carpet were heavily worn. The table in the room had terrible scuffs and was made worse by an attempted cover up with magic markers. The carpeting beside the windows was fraying terribly, the robe that was in the closet was pilling to such a bad extent, it should have been thrown out! I called the front desk and was told someone would be up to look at the problems but no one ever came. One afternoon I asked for the shuttle to take me to a nearby establishment but when the shuttle van driver looked up the address I was told it was zero point two 0.2 mikes further than the 3 mile radius and despite not being busy at all, my request was refused. Instead I was pointed in the direction of a cab and told I had to pay myself if I wanted to go there. All in all it just seemed the entire staff were too busy doing nothing and were simply counting the hours until they were off. On day of checkout I informed the manager on duty of all my issues and as compensation I was offered 10,000 reward points. It's now been two months and I am still waiting for those points. The Cobb Galleria area is now more popular than ever due to the opening of the new stadium, and while this hotel is definitely very close by, there are many other hotels equally close that are far better choices for anyone coming to this area.",Bad
"We had high hopes for this place and were sorely disappointed. The bathrooms are TINY which is ridiculous as there are two closets so why when the did the rehab didn't they widen the bathroom into the closet The shower is 2 feet wide and you need to stand at an angle to the sink to use it because there is no room. The toilet is wedged between the sink and shower.There is only a desk chair, no comfortable seating in the room. I had a decent street view but the window was painted shut.Despite being in the Tenderloin I like the location, easy access for the Ubers and far less touristy than Union Square, there is a great breakfast place across the street called Farm:Table. But all in all I would suggest a full service Marriott nearby for an extra 20Frederico1st - We will like to sincerely apologize about the inconvenience you faced during your recent visit and we are also disappointed that you did not enjoy your stay.

She had requested dbl beds but be cause her room on her profile was king size, we ended up with a chair and a king size bed for 4 ppl. The next day we waited for someone to contact us and know on did.. We had to go to the desk and ask. They gave us a room w king bed and a pull out which would have been alright but we would have gotten exactly what was needed from another hotel in the area and cheaper if someone would have told us earlier in the day.After that they gave us one thin blanket for the pull out. Requested another and they were out. Finally got one . when the maid came to clean she took one of the blankets. We had to call down to correct that.. All in all it was a good trip but bad service... They need to communicate more with each other and there guess that are having problems to make there stay enjoyable and uncomplicated.Thank you for visiting the JW Marriott Atlanta for your special occasion.

"We've just returned from a one-night stay at the Lamplighter, which we chose based upon the TripAdvisor reviews and rating. For the first time, Trip Advisor has let us down. I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego!It is not great value for the money it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The lush landscaping of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad.The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient. But it does not by any stretch of the imagination deserve the inflated rating it now enjoys on TripAdvisor.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. We appreciate hearing from all of our guests. These reviews show us not only our areas of strength, but also the areas in which we can improve. TripAdvisor measures only one thing, guest satisfaction. It is not a measure of luxury or location. On TripAdvisor, an economy hotel can score very well and a luxury hotel can score poorly. It is clearly displayed on TripAdvisor that our hotel class is a 2-star (were a AAA 2-diamond property), with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. There definitely are hundreds of luxurious hotels in San Diego to choose from, but at a much higher cost and possibly a lower level of guest satisfaction. Our rating on TripAdvisor is a byproduct of our single-minded dedication to consistent service, quality, and value. We are proud of the ambiance we have created with the space we have available to us. We definitely dont have the grounds that a larger hotel might have, but we have taken great effort to fill our space with colorful plants, flowers, vines, and many lovely palm trees. Its an expense many mid-market hotels arent willing to incur. Regarding your room, it is a kitchen layout that is very popular with many guests staying for long periods as they have full size appliances and plenty of counter space. While none of them are stocked, we do provide full kitchen packs upon request. We do this to protect our guests. We have learned from experience that by keeping the kits in a sealed container, we can ensure that when a new guest arrives, the kit they receive will be clean, complete and in good condition. Im sorry this was not explained to you. Our company culture is to provide outstanding customer service, quality and value to our guests. We manage two hotels in San Diego, we are proud that both are in the top 15 on TripAdvisor. Thank you again for your review. We do appreciate the comments.

The reason I stayed there was because all the recommended hotels by Cisco were full, so this was my only choice.I checked in and was told the restaurant was closed for repairs, i accepted that, but when i got to my room and opened the door I had just realized my nightmare. The bathroom was filthy, the carpets were disgusting with stains and the room had the smell of Death in it. I knew someone else staying there, so I went to their room to see how it was and it was even worse!,,,,what a joke this place is. I tried to login into the wireless, it DID NOT WORK THE ENTIRE DURATION OF MY STAY. After the second night of sleeping in my clothes because of how disgusting the room was, I looked under my bed and low and behold A DEAD RAT.i jumped up, ran to the front desk and told them about it... They did not even look phased, worried or cared and without missing a beat she said all I can do is get you another room....

"We were travelling up west coast and arrived in s.f. when the nike ladies marathon was on, which we did not realise. Made it impossible to get a hotel room. Eventually we arrived at Columbus Inn which had a free room for the night.Hotel was cheaper than others we had tried on the shore but very basic. Think we paid approx 170 for the night and do not think that this really represented value for money, although there was free parking which was good as it always annoys me when US hotels have an additonal charge to use their car park.Room was ok - had the feel that the cleanliness of the hotel was not great but did not actually have any issues. This was maybe more due to the impression the hotel gives by fact that it is quite run down. Hotel is in dire need of a coat of paint!!!Was glad that we were able to get a room here as nowhere else was available but that probably says something in itself.

"We checked in at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami on October 21st we were kindly picked up with a limousine service at the Airport and greeted at the hotel lobby, the front desk assistant was extremely kind and gave us a beautiful room on the 8th floor overlooking the wonderful Brickell bay. We had a lovely Junior Suite given that we made all our reservations through the American Express Platinum Travel Services and of course they have certain perks. So far our experience was really lovely, the reason why we were visiting Miami was because my girlfriend and I were celebrating her birthday and it was her present, aside I took the opportunity of meeting up with few business associates. During the early morning of Monday the 24th of October, I got up from the bed and was hoping to start our day, however as the blinds were totally closed the room was dark and I misstepped on some silky pillows that were on the floor, given that they never came to do the turndown of the room, (usually around 18hrs they remove the silky decorative pillows as well as the covers and prepare the room for sleep). As a result I fell head first broke the fall with my arm groping on the desk in front of the bed where the TV was placed. I was startled from the impact and due to the obvious noise I woke up my girlfriend. Once we turned on the lights we saw that my hand was slightly bruised from the impact and of course since I am not a light guy 110kg of weight the result was an impact against the TV screen which ended up broken. We had informed the room service, and security came to inquire and inspect and make pictures. More concretely 2 security staff and the manager on duty. The security staff asked some questions and provided me with some ice for the hand. They told us that it was a clear trip and fall and they accommodated us. The manager Mr. Hendrik Grebe on the other hand did not show any concern nor did he tried to communicate with us. Security came again minutes later to help us fill in a report and we of course did it following their advice. We were told that they will get back to us for the matter of replacing the tv and whatever else we could need for such incident. The evening of the same day we came back to our hotel room and found that the tv was not replaced nor has the room been made up. Moreover there had not been a single attempt to try to clarify the situation or see if we could need any further help. We contacted the front desk about the tv and we were told that they just dont have a replacement tv, instead I had to request to be moved to a different room. Approximately an hour later they provided us with the same kind of room on a different floor. The day after it was our departure date and I was having breakfast with some business associates at their restaurant and while I was walking my guest out of the Mandarin one of the security staff approached me and said that the manager on duty would like to have a word, which obviously created an awkward moment. Furthermore the manager on duty Mr. Kelvin Jiles came to speak to me and informed me that I was going to be charged 1.300 usd aprox for the tv, given that the manager from the day of the incident reported it as property damage. Of course I did not expect this, nothing was communicated to us, and no one ever made an effort to clarify such a situation. Obviously I had several questions of my own as to why this incident was treated in such a manner with the lack of communicating and unprofessionally of the Mr. Hendrik Grebes part.I was told by Mr. Kelvin Jiles that it would be possible to speak to Mr. Grebe later in the day and requested me to come back at 3pm. However Mr. Grebe never came out to us, instead we spoke to the head of security for the hotel. Previously we were able to read the internal written report supposedly written by Mr. Grebe where he defined the situation as I was caught by a housekeeping staff who brought our breakfast and I declined or pretended I never ordered, later in the report they said it was a mistake from room service obviously I never ordered such a breakfast, on top my girlfriend was referred to as a friend who spent the night in my room, also they insinuated that I could have been drunk, and worse was there could have been a case of domestic violence. That has been the most insulting situation I have ever found myself in not to say how ashamed I was when my girlfriend read such a report. I of course was told by every person who approached to us from the staff that they absolutely understand our disagreement, and confusion of such an absurd situation. They repeatedly told us that the charged were done on my card and kept on apologizing.We are usual costumers of the Mandarin Oriental more concretely we had just been 5 days at their hotel in NYC. We feel horrified at the treatment and lack of professional approach and we still havent been given a proper or justified answer to the events. I hope this long letter helps for any future similar occurrences.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay about Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. We have reviewed the information detailing the events that occurred during your stay and your concerns regarding the charges applied to your account. Please understand the health, safety and comfort of our guests is our top priority and our personnel did show concern for your well being as well as that of your guest. While we do understand that accidents happen from time to time there are several statements that conflict with our findings and the lock audits that were done as part of this investigation which do not support that the damages were a result of an accidental trip or fall.We have sent you a separate letter discussing this situation and we hope we can work together in finding an amicable solution. Please call me to further discuss.Sincerely,Jorge GonzalezGeneral Manager",Bad

"Disappointing wouldnt begin to encompass our experience here last weekend. Perhaps it was due to the holiday weekend, but as SPG Gold members, we have never experienced service as blatantly rude as we did at this property. It was so unbelievable at times we thought we surely were the victims of an odd hidden camera show where at any point a host might pop out and say Just kidding! We just wanted to record your facial expressions while we lied to you, hung up on you, and generally treated loyal paying guests like dirt. First off, the good this hotel is in a great location if you want to be in the heart of the French Quarter. Youre in the middle of Bourbon Streets action and the hotel gives you easy access to many of the citys attractions. The staff who man the valet are friendly and awesome. The pillows are comfortable. Thats about the end of the positives. During our three night stay two couples, two rooms we experienced many negatives. In addition to just generally unkempt rooms (smelled like stale vomit when we walked in the door, showers dont drain, sticky surfaces) they were not cleaned until very late in the day. Even cleaned, dirty towels were left in the room, trash wasnt taken away, and little more done than smoothing out the duvet and tossing clean towels on the bathroom shelves. Wed been informed by Starwood that a junior suite was available and that we would have the option to upgrade on our second and third nights, however, the front desk denied having a suite available for us. We reconfirmed a suite was available with Starwood, and then were again lied to by the hotels front desk staff who told us they did not have a suite available for us. Each of these interactions were incredibly brusque and rude. Early Saturday morning, when my husband returned from an evening out with his brother, he called down to the front desk and asked if a bottle of water could be sent up to the room, as wed already used the single bottle of complimentary water provided much earlier during our stay. The front desk attendant told him no and that he could come back down to the front desk and BUY a bottle of water. He told her that in every other Starwood property weve stayed in, it hasnt been a problem to get an extra bottle of complimentary water and that hed be happy to come down to the desk to get it, but didnt want to buy one. She told him he could come down and buy a bottle of water, then hung up on him. It was raining on Sunday morning and at 8:30am we called the front desk to ask if the hotel had any umbrellas available for guests to borrow. We were told, No theyre already all out for the day. And again promptly hung up on. No alternate suggestions, no apologies. It doesnt take a genius to know there are not a lot of people staying on Bourbon Street up and roaming around at 8:30am on a Sunday morning. Fast forward to a couple of hours later when we returned to the hotel to prepare to check out and head home. We asked for a couple of trash bags to put our now soaking clothes in for the trip home. Fully expecting a No and hang up, we were shocked when they said theyd send some up. Guess we should have known better than to get our hopes up because the trash bags didnt show up until over half an hour later, as we were walking out the door, and had made due shifting our luggage around other ways and utilizing gifts bags from shopping. Couple all this with the hotel staff being generally unfriendly no returned smile or greeting when you enter the hotel, no effort to provide any degree of positive customer service or build rapport, no willingness to help ensure you actually enjoy your time at their property it was an incredibly disconcerting Starwood experience. If you just want a place to lay your head in between jaunts on Bourbon Street and service means nothing to you, this is your place. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.I am very sorry to hear of your experience during your stay with us. The comments you have noted are certainly disappointing to hear.

"While the hotel is clean and in an excellent location, you will NOT get a good night's sleep here if you have neighbors above you who need to fulfill their 10,000 daily steps in the middle of the night. Of the four nights we stayed here all four nights were full of different neighbors above us who for some reason need to walk back and forth around their room ALL NIGHT LONG, banging cabinets, doors, etc. Complaints to the house host were not helpful at all. We never got a decent night sleep here. Also, don't believe the shuttle stuff. We tried every day to get one, first being told just call 10 mins before you need one, then told you must come downstairs in person and wait, and oh by the way it would be a 40 min wait (when the shuttle only goes a 1 mile radius I do not understand). Never was able to get a shuttle the entire time we were there. The staff at the morning buffet were wonderful, friendly, but the hot food was not hot, the selection was small. And lastly, take the stairs. The elevator is S-L-O-W. We often waited more than 5 minutes. I would not stay here again, mostly because of the noise factor.Hello, Julie!Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are sorry to hear that you did not get a good nights sleep - that's the exact opposite of what we are shooting for! Noise complaints are relatively uncommon for us, and we will investigate a bit to see if anything can be done about the particular room you stayed in. I am sorry too to hear of your experience with the shuttle. I know it seems crazy, but with traffic sometimes a shuttle run for several passengers within a mile can take much longer than expected. It sounds like we could have done a much better job communicating with you though. We appreciate the feedback and will certainly use it as a training opportunity internally. Thank you again and we hope to have the chance to serve you again - with a good nights sleep!",Bad
"We stayed at La Hacienda because it was close to the SafeCo field and we had to get to a Mariner's game. We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad, with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty, there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds, as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.",Bad
"Our family stayed there for one evening in March and were not impressed. The hotel is newly renovated, however the building is quite old. You can hear people walking, talking, running. If you have kids staying above your suite, good luck on getting any sleep. While having breakfast, in the morning, the fire alarm went off, and it was very loud and went off for quite some time, possibly 10 min, we were all looking at each other, thinking what to do, while the staff was walking around casually, there was no direction, evacuation procedure, zero communication. Finally, we asked one of the servers if he knew what was happening, he explained that they will be here soon to fix it. That was it. After we checked out, my wife realized that she had left her gold bracelet on the night table. We phoned the hotel and returned only to find nothing and that the staff no e speak English. Only the cleaning staff has access to a securely card-lock controlled room. We are told basically too bad, so sad. We wrote letter and called the hotel and head office. The same response, sorry, could not find it Basically, the gold bracelet walked out of the room on its own. Very dissatisfied and unhappy. Very unresponsive management. Will not stay there, nor will we recommend it. We paid to stay at a hotel and get robbed.Dear Valued Guest,We appreciate your candid response. I apologize on behalf of Four Points by Sheraton that your stay was not as expected.Yes we are a fully renovated new hotel in Seattle, and I apologize for the fire alarm. When this happened we were instructed by the Fire Department to wait until they arrived to silence it.Regarding your gold bracelet, as we discussed earlier, we did do a thorough investigation looking for this and questioned our staff. The Housekeeper that cleaned your room is a trusted and valued employee. It is unfortunate the bracelet was missing, but were not able to locate it anywhere.I apologize for these situations again.

In short, she was rude and inconsiderate when asked questions. As Marriott Platinum members they give you a free item from their market per room to use during stay which SHE turned around and charged for on the credit card. Essentially they committed fraud and acted like they couldn't do anything to make situations right when guests are unhappy.

"Good location, good size of apartment, but that it, bathroom in the living room smelled like pee with less than half a roll of toilet paper available, there was a pube in the drawer of the fridge which is hilarious because the notice of the entrance says the fridge is always cleaned prior to every visit. There is not cable, they have those antennas that try to find local channels so I spent the entire time watching PBS Kids because it was the only channel the antenna would take in. Doors are very dirty, balcony doors would not lock, furniture is beat up, bed squeaky and would sink so deep I could feel the springs,extra blanket very stinky smell like it was overused and never washed, closet door missing, hairballs in the bathroom, and everything was VERY VERY dusty. SOOO NOT what this place made it to believe it was for the price. It looked like the person who cleaned this place did not care to do their job and it was either never done, or I was given a room that had not been touched in months. Go spend the same elsewhere and get a better experience, or spend less and still get a way better experience.Dear seviemj, thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a feedback of your experience.

"Overall, stay here if you are paying 65 or less...else keep looking..definitely not worth a penny more.Stayed the weekend of Feb 13th and due to the high demand for rooms that weekend, this Rodeway Inn was charging 150/night (including taxes, etc)...a complete ripoff. I used priceline and will ensure to pick a higher category of hotels next time around, especially since 150 is insane to charge for this property no matter what supply/demand looks like. First of all, we were given a room on the side of the highway. This is completely fine if you keep the a/c on because that will drown out some of the noise. However, when we walked in the room, it smelled (stale smoke). We immediately called the front desk and asked for another room or to come and spray something. They said there are no rooms available and that they have no febreeze. You'd think that if you're doubling the hotel price for a particular weekend, you would step up service at least a bit. We received no follow up call from the manager the next day nor did the front desk staff attempt to spray anything to remove the foul odor. We next walked into the bathroom and noticed that the towel was stained with dirt. The good thing was that there were extra towels but I don't get what kind of quality control exists at the hotel if you cannot ensure clean towels. Further, the tv was horrible. They list all these channels on their guide however, they subscribe to none of them. Why false advertise to your customers.Again, the price we were charged for this hotel was obscene, especially when a real hotel was charging 20 - 30 more. I have nobody to blame but myself for booking this hotel however the review stands given the fact that I did not receive the services I paid for.",Bad
"This place wasn't as bad as some made it out to be but I won't be seeking it out for my next stay in AC and definitely would never stay here for full price. The comment made that it's a motel attached to a nice hotel about sums it up but I'll elaborate.The hallways are pretty dingy, carpets ripped in places and neon lights on each floor which I think are meant to embrace the kitschy but just wind up just casting a glow that exacerbates the horror-movie feel of the rundown place.The room itself wasn't too bad. Small, but suited our purposes. I actually think the carpet and paint were fairly new. A really old beat up dresser but a nice flat screen atop of it and the bed and pillows were very comfortable and clean. There was also a balcony which would have been a nice touch but it was flooded with dirty water while we were there. No getting around it. The bathroom was old. Broken ugly tile, some weird yellow glaze over half the floor tiles, rust on the vanity and in the tub. But there were adequate towels, everything worked, and it seemed like everything was clean which is the more important part. The water pressure was pretty okay though the water temperature did not get very hot. Somebody else complained of their room smelling like pot and we had the same experience, I think it was coming through the bathroom vent.The part that will keep me from coming back were the thin walls. Despite the comfy beds, I got basically no sleep. It was Friday night in AC, people want to have a good time, and I can't really fault the hotel for their guests so I forgive the women who decided to belt out showtunes at 3AM directly outside our door. They were pretty good, but I'm just not a theater person. The thing that drove me craziest was the elevator. After one trip on it my husband and I opted for the stairs, but some brave souls were taking it all hours of the night and every single time they landed on our floor, I woke up. PING! Somebody commented that the elevator bell was loud and I thought they were being nit-picky but it turns out this is the loudest elevator bell I've ever heard in my life. We weren't even directly across from it and it was loud enough to act as an alarm clock every time on our floor-mates came back from the casino. We had a late check-out but couldn't leave early enough to get home and get some sleep. I would say if you're taking a trip where you know you'll be out all night and won't be getting any sleep anyway, AND you can get a deal, this isn't the worst place you could drop off your stuff.",Bad

I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again.",Bad
"First, the place is located in a great place. And the woman who greeted me was very very helpful and nice. However, if you're on a business trip and need the ammenities that come with a well-stocked hotel, this place is not for you. I had a single room on the top floor (4th floor), I had no air-conditioning, no fan, and the window didn't create air flow in the room (when the temperature was 80 degrees outside, the room was much warmer). I'm not quite sure what the other reviews mean when they say all the rooms are huge because I had a really small room, with a twin bed that barely fit me. The WIFI was worse than the modem I used in 1997 and I barely could get anything done on my computer (I couldn't even check in for my flight on my computer). There is no television in your room. I had to share a bathroom with other people (which is fine), but it's nice to have your own, especially when you're running around to get out the door fast. One morning, I had to leave around 6 AM, and I think I actually stood naked in the shower for about 5 minutes for the water to get hot. I guess this place would be great if you just needed a base camp for your time in Boston. I was there for job interviews (and I thought I could save some money), but I actually regret it since one night, the room was so hot, I think I only had 2-3 hours of sleep.",Bad

"I initially reserved a room, on my own, at the Knights Inn Market Center in Dallas, Texas. The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call. Thank you for your feedback, your feedback is very valuable to us since it helps us improve our services.",Bad

Really So she quickly sent me to another room, but forgot to change my key card, so I had to return to the desk again. I had a terrible couple of nights sleep because outside my window the garbage trucks were dumping dumpsters of garbage from the entire building across the street.

"I don't ask very much more from a hotel than to have clean rooms, and for a hotel that is new the maintenance obviously lacks. The bathroom had hair from previous people. The bedskirt and in between beds had so much dust and dirt and even old chewing gum wrappers, it was obvious that it had never been cleaned. The carpet hadn't been vacuumed and the carpet in corridor was stained and dirty. It was very dissapointing but it was too late when we realised it, it all seemed okay at first sight. The hotel also overlooks I4 which I didn't care for.",Bad
"We arrived to find out that the hotel was under refurbishment. We checked into a King Suite on the ground floor (115) and were staying over a weekend (saturday to monday night inclusive). I realise this is a business hotel and the weekends are quiet so it provides the opportunity to refurbish but here is a thought. This is a 2 wing hotel, one wing on each side of the pool. If I were the General Manager I would have arranged the refurb to take place in one wing and then the other thus limiting disturbance to 50 of the hotel and keeping it 100 isolated. Instead the refurb is happening on the third of three floors on both wings and banging noises can be heard throughout the entire hotel. We are frequent travellers and we always require the hotels we stay in to be quiet and 100 comfortable. My wife was ill with a stomach bug and needed to sleep. My daughter is a 20 month old toddler and needs to take sleeps throughout the day. The constant hammering from the workmen prevented this. I contacted the front desk 3 times to complain and the banging continued despite assurances it would be dealt with. I eventually walked to reception with my daughter in my arms and made my grievance known to the staff that I felt I was not being listened to. I was then contacted by staff and told I could move if I wished to another room where no noise was guaranteed. I think they fail to see the point. I don't see why guests should have to repack all their belongings and move to accomodate the disturbance. The disturbance should move or quit to accomodate the guests. It's not rocket science. It's a shame because the hotel is nice and the staff are pleasant. I am not usually easily rattled but banging noises in a hotel - NO WAY!Please allow me to extend my sincerest apologies for the noise disturbance during your stay. I can assure you that many months of careful planning have gone into our renovation and the decision to renovate by floor rather than wing was made based on a number of factors, one being guest safety. Based on the layout of our rooms and elevator location, a different plan would have required our guests to walk through a construction zone to reach their rooms. Not every stage of the renovation is affiliated with noise and the fast majority of our guests are not disturbed at all. I am truly sorry that your wife and daughter were not able to rest peacefully and hope we can make it up to you during your next visit.",Bad

Asked to speak with someone with authority, asst. manager now involved. All I can say.... thank goodness reservation was booked thru an executive / director with the Hyatt chain.... Or we would of been screwed royally.Checkout was a disaster. Credit cards presented and staff unable to handle splitting the charges to two credit cards. Not only do they charge full amount to both cards, but do it twice. Trying to correct was a nightmare. Once back in Canada, numerous calls and numerous employees in Accounting involved. With the exchange on the CDN dollar, I'm still out of pocket for their error.Plus side, never again. Avoid this property.

"This hotel is in great proximity to downtown Atlanta. That being said, it still isn't worth the deal. We arrived at 3:30, with the understanding that check in was at 3. When I walked in, there's no one at the front desk and there was a sign that read Be back in 10 minutes, if you're checking out, just leave your room key. I thought that strange but hung around for a bit before I finally got tired of waiting, and my friend and I decided we would go eat and come back. So I come back and there is a gentlemen in front of me checking in and someone at the front desk this time.... so good sign. Boy did I stand in line FOREVER. I did mention that fact that I tried to check in earlier there was no one at the front desk and the clerk was incredibly dismissive and I think the fact I said anything made him want to take even longer to check me in which really ticked me off. We get to our room the air unit wasn't on so it was incredibly stuffy and smelled of mildew. The beds looked felt prison issued and one of the blankets looked like it hadn't ever been washed. I will say the bathroom was very clean and I appreciated that. There's only one elevator and you can fit about 3 people max in it that's without luggage. Oh and GA does some thing where you have to pay an extra 5 now. So whatever the website says your price is, add 5. When I checked out the next morning, the front desk girl made it abundantly clear that I was inconveniencing her by checking out and asking for a receipt. If we had planned to stay more than one night, I would have left went somewhere else immediately. The whole place was very sketchy so be mindful if you decide to stay here.",Bad

"This hotel was awful. My boyfriend and I were going for an anniversary weekend as we aren't 21 yet, it was hard to get a hotel in downtown Seattle. We read the bad reviews, but decided to take a chance as our options were severely limited. The room was on the first floor, opened into a parking lot and the door had at least an inch of clearance from the floor. (this was the 'king suite'!) We had to plug this gap with a towel at night to keep out the loud freeway noise and cold air. The bed was only questionably clean, and some of the lights didn't work. Our biggest problem, however, was with the shower! The water pressure was ridiculously high if you stood in the spray, the pressure was so bad that it would ricochet off your body and through the curtain, no matter how tightly you closed it. A lot of water ended up on the floor our first morning, and after we dressed we went to inform the man at the front desk. As soon as I began to politely describe the problem, he very loudly interrupted me, telling me that there have never been any complaints such as this before in my opnion, this indicates that there probably have, but that's just my intuition. He followed us to the room and looked at the bathroom, very loudly and rudely proclaiming that it was all our fault the whole time. He closed the curtain and attempted to demonstrate how the water could be kept in the shower although water was still coming out (which my boyfriend politely indicated) he refused to acknowledge that and even went so far as to accuse us of doing 'wild things' in the shower!! For the record, shampooing my hair was about as wild as I got in there, and I doubt my boyfriend was doing anything weird during his shower either. We ended up having to pay a fee to clean it up, and I will never stay there again. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!!",Bad

Which clogged the drain at 1st, I never knew a screen could hold so much dirt, this thing probably hadn't been cleaned for years! They need to get 2014 Acs. Other than the front lobby which was nice and cold the rest of hotel was broiling. The hall way reminded me of the place I live where its hard to breathe! Just terrible!I was thinking of giving this place a 3 but due to their low handed trickery I went with a 2 instead.The bed was hard as a board! I'm surprised I even slept. I woke up with a kink in my neck.Thankfully we did not come across anything bad that I read about...While I did see some care taken to the room, I feel the managers wishes are pie in the sky as far as improvements 2014 or 2016 etc. The bed was just horrible.Now my friend did mention something I thought was cute we got a double room with individual bathrooms, Both had big closets too. It seemed so same sex like both of these touches.The rainbow flag flew outside this hotel.My favorite thing is the tv was nice we had a 40 in Samsung. I bought a LG for my apt 2 yrs ago. Samsung actually looks a slight bit crisper or its newerLocation is what you pay for here! Although on their room key they have an ad for Domino's, walk down North Broadway and get real Chicago style pizza that was yummy from Renaldi's After Dark 2831 N Broadway StChicago, Illinois 60657 . I had the last piece of our large pie for lunch yesterday. I could only eat 3 slices it was so big, and the crust so thick.!I'm glad I gave Renaldi's pizza a try, I go to Aldi's to shop, and Aldi's had this brand Reggio's from Chicago that gave me heartburn the sauce is too rich and hot, but Renaldi's thankfully isn't anything like this. Really this was the highlight of my Chicago stop over on way back to NY. We went just before we checked in.As for this service Inn speaks of, thats kind of a joke! Let me tell you why...my friend calls on street by his parked car at 7 PM 7/21/2014 after we have eaten.At first lady can't answer his about a rate for tonight, he holds on for over 5 mins, then hangs up, calls back does it again, 3rd time they finally answer his I personally would've given up on this place after a 5 mins of non response. They need a 2nd customer service person 24/7!He asks for AARP discount and they give it to him for 40 off. So you think you're getting a good deal ....wait for it......parking....ahhhh 30 + tax to that...he states in NYC its 40 so not so bad.....anyway ..it costs 176 total for one night with tax after a 40 discount....The french toast was good, and so was the egg, it was cute how they cut up the doughnuts in half, for those watching their figure.... I thought it was nice to see my 2 milk I buy from Walmart too back home. The small danish was good and so was the choc ice frosted doughnut .There was a problem though after I ate some, I went into elevator back to our room 417.Instead I got off 3rd floor and got scared I knocked on 2 doors which I though were our side of the floor. You see they have a stupid ad for pizza on our room key but no room . My friend said they got scared cuz of the way the elevator made a jerking noise, this thing was probably never updated since the hotel began in 1910's, from what I read it was a Comfort Inn at one time, I wonder if it failed to meet standards and was dropped from the chain...Anyway my one encounter with the front desk was ok, I had to tell her his name, and got the room , went back upstairs, and gave him a hug when I saw him, this was a big traumatizing exp. To add to this I can get around Chicago without a map, and I last was in the city 20 yrs ago.I guess I just thought I wouldn't have to make a mental note of room.I don't want to write a book so I'll close by saying in a way we lucked out, cuz on Tues 7/22/2014 the Cubbies were playing a game so the hotel was sold out the rest of week!Even if it wasn't close to the perfect stay, I slept ok, and was able to survive the rest of day til my friend pushed thru to get me home at midnight!Thank you for taking the time to let me know about your stay.

"I called the hotel from the Atlanta airport where I was stranded. They could not find my business account on the phone---even though I have a corporate account and are one of the largest companies in the world. I was too tired to keep asking the operator. I booked and then immediately---and I mean immediately called twice to cancel as I didn't understand how far away the hotel was from the airport. I called twice and my question was brushed off. Both operators were very professional, but were obviously trained how to brush off those questions and immediately ask if I wanted to book something else. I have stayed all over the world for decades and have never, ever been charged a no show for cancelling within a couple minutes of booking. Heck, I've even been refunded airline tickets when I immediately cancel. You can tell me it was your policy, but the hotel seriously lacks the desire to do the right thing. I have stayed in another Aloft before and have been a faithful SPG member for many years. I assure you that I will avoid this chain and will spread the word within my company to do the same.Dear TampaDude2, We sincerely apologize for your dissatisfying experience while booking your stay. Its our goal to provide excellent customer service to our guests throughout the entire booking process, and we are very sorry we fell short on this during your cancellation call.

We founded it out because theyattached all our laundry bag, in the closet. Full of cloth waiting tobe picked up. They where very small black sticky ants, those you cannottake away with nothing. I felt horrible about this. It was discusting! I felt really ashamed and didnt whant anyone to see that repugnant scene. And the room, even though it had a beautifull bathtub in the middle of the room, separatyng sleeping area from bathing area, it was really small for the price payed. Decoration was excellent.

"My fiance and I have a one year old daughter and wanted to have a nice night out just the two of us. I had only heard good things about the Chelsea, and the price range was very good for a Saturday night. We checked in around 10:30 pm. The first room they gave us had a leak in the bathroom, resulting in water all over the floor. The bathrooms were so outdated - like straight out of the 50's tile etc. We called maintenance and they sent us to another room. The bed was decent, but everything else was falling apart. The shower head was coming out of the wall, and when you turned the shower on water leaked all over because there were holes in the tile near the knobs. The light fixture in the room was busted in. It was just grimey and disgusting. Oh, and I can't leave out the fact that our room overlooked the lovely streets of Atlantic City where we heard EVERY car system bumping, people yelling, sirens and other loud noises all night long. Plus the fact that we heard every noise from the rooms next to us, people BANGING on doors, running and yelling down the hallway. Neither of us slept a wink, which was the whole purpose of our peaceful night out. After being up all night, finally at 5 am we proceeded to the front desk to check out. We told them that we never complain, but it was a terrible experience and I even showed them the pictures I had taken of everything that was broken and dirty in our room. Not to mention the entire building smelled like marijuana and vomit. They didn't even give us a refund, nor offered to comp anything. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN OR REFER PEOPLE HERE! So much for a nice, quiet, romantic night out!!!!",Bad
I called there asking to speak to my husband in the room in which he was staying. I gave the first and last name. I had failed to ask my husband for the room number...however due to the fact that I was not staying there and never been asked that before by any other hotel I was a little confused.... More,Bad
"Rude customer service at check in even for a Hilton Diamond Member,noisy, only 1 elevator working. Large group of over 100 plus in the hotel breakfast area making it impossible to even grab a cup of coffee. Worst hotel in 11 years of business travel. Thank you for sharing your comments regarding your recent stay here at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center. Thank you for being a Diamond Member. Please except my apologies on behalf of our entire staff that our hotel while normally is quiet and busy, the hotel was noisy during this groups stay. We did have 5 bus tours of guests who were attending the International Rotary Convention. Sorry for the inconvenience that you were not able to get in to get your coffee during the peak time from in which most of the group had previously arrived. Once again my apologies , I hope that you will give us another opportunity to win you back. We do appreciate your business and we want you back with us.",Bad
"I checked out and moved to another Best Western in town right after I checked in to this hotel. Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback. We've read through your review in detail and are sorry to hear of the service and room cleanliness issues you experienced. It is our top priority to ensure each guest has an exceptional stay and it appears we fell short of this goal during your visit. Rest assured, we will discuss your concerns with our staff to prevent these issues from reoccurring for future guests. Thank you again for your review.

The hotel is very rundown. I was very disappointed. The mattresses were terrible you could feel Springs,Bad
"I'm writing this as I prepare to check out, this way the recollections are fresh.I just got back to the computer after the door opened. Fortunately I used the chain lock. Not do be negative, there were a few good things. The parking lot has a high fence, which is good since the neighborhood made me nervous. No stores nearby, a good drive willl get you to places with vagrants and loiterers outside, lexan cages to protect the cashiers.The clerk wanted to be helpful, but there was only one of her. I waited in line each of the 3 times it took to lug my bags up and down from the 5th floor because the key cards did not work. The next day when I got back from a gruelling 12 hour work day, the keys did not work again, 2 more times up and down with heavy gear. The fridge worked and was properly adjusted. Beds were comfortable.Close to Turner Field and the Georgia dome and the airport.That's it for the good. The room was dirty, not cleaned surfaces with dried spills, hair in my ice bucket. One of the 2 old, noisy, shuddering elevators gave up the ghost and trapped a guest. The Internet worked but was very slow. I would have my toenails pulled before I book here again.Scott M,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review of our hotel and your experiences during your stay. Since your stay we have made many improvements and continue the effort to continuously elevate our level of service. I hope you will stay with us again and experience the positive changes we have made during your next visit to Atlanta. We have fully renovated our property and all our guest rooms, which I hope you will be able to experience when you next stay in Atlanta. Again, thank you for your comments, all feedback is used to help improve our efforts to build our hotel staff and product into a destination guests look forward to visiting.Sincerely,Enoch D.",Bad

"This is not an attractive hotel. It is an old hotel. There were spider webs near the sink. There was mold inside of the restroom (near the shower). There was no microwave or refrigerator. I was told to go downstairs to get extra towels. There were a lot of human noise outside during the night. Prostitutes seem to be roaming on the property. During checkout, the guy at the front desk seemed nonchalant when questions were asked.",Bad
"I recently stayed at the Francisco Bay Inn during a conference in San Francisco, and based upon my last minute booking, was left with few viable lodging choices at a reasonable rate. This hotel is unclean, my room, and the room of my traveling colleague, had a funky unpleasant odor that required the AC to (partially) clear out. The bathroom had cracked floor tiles, peeling wallpaper, stains on the walls, and the decor is overall is extremely outdated.The glass door of the office/reception area has been smashed, and the outlet in my bathroom burned out and destroyed my relatively new Braun electric razor. The manager let me know they tested the electrical outlets, and since voltage was apparently normal, they wouldn't do anything about my razor.The location is convenient, and the woman who checked us into our rooms was nice. Otherwise, an overpriced, terrible place to stay. The Buena Vista a block down the street is a better choice for the same general rate.",Bad
"The manager kept changing rates without notice during my stay. Questionable business ethics. Only cereal and coffee for breakfast. Noisy except in rear rooms, which are not used in winter. Poor maid service.",Bad
"So I booked this room before looking at the reviews. Honestly, your opinion is all going to vary upon your expectations. Almost everything that everyone wrote was true. The paper states 2 queen beds, which were actually full beds. The beds were probably the best thing in the room. The dresser drawers do continue to open, so there may also be ghost in there. It had a bathroom, the toilet ran the entire time, but it worked. The bathrooms are very outdated, but everything worked. The shower was clean and water pressure sucked per expected. Now.. one of the nastiest things is looking up and seeing vomit all over the bathroom moldings, all I wondered was how did that get there The elevator was suspect and you could possibly fear for your life until it opens. I can see myself staying there again, if the price is right. Like I said, its all on your expectations. I didn't expect much, so it turned out not that bad. Good location. The downstairs diner food was good.",Bad
"The hotel looks good, and I don't know if things have gotten bad lately, but when we stayed there it was noisy as heck and the place is run by kids. We stayed AT FIRST (but not for long) on the first floor. Whatever was going on above us sounded like a wrestling match. It was there when we checked... More",Bad
Room need to be update shower was very dirty and also had water leaking I called the front desk and told them my issue no one came to look at it . sheets and blankets need to be replace. House keeping people are rude and don't know how to knock on doors,Bad
"Let me begin by accentuating the positive, check in staff and shuttle drivers are friendly and efficient. Room is dated but not dirty. Air didn't work properly. Lunch buffet although tasty is no where worth 22.00 for 2 meats , 2 vegetables and salad.pool and hot tub were gross. A dirty film covered the water. Hair was everywhere. Very dirty. Wait staff at the bar are rude . They act like you are bothering them to ask for service. This hotel is no where worth the they charge. Also watch your bill. They tried to charge me for items that I didn't buy. The Marriott just across the street is a much better option.On behalf of the entire hotel staff we appreciate you taking the time to write a review, Thank you for the nice comments on our staff. Our lunch prices are comparable to the other full service hotels in the market, We will have our engineers check the filtering system at the pool to see if there is an issue. We will address your comments about the service at the bar with the Food and Beverage Director.",Bad
"After carefully reviewing places to stay, my friend and I decided on The Annex at the Chelsea. The photos looked nice and the reviews were good. Also, the amenities were good for that price point and location. We were greeted by the friendly and welcoming valet staff. We entered a nice lobby and the desk staff was pleasant. We get our keys and head all the way down the hall. It now appears that The Annex is not quite The Chelsea and should not be called The Annex at the Chelsea. From what I can see, The Annex was a small motel/hotel that was next door to The Chelsea, went out of business and The Chelsea decided to take it over. A really bad move for the Chelsea. The elevators were small and needed to be serviced, the carpet in the hall was nasty. Thanks for the dim lighting we were not able to see what the carpet really looked like. I really couldnt believe the bright neon lights on each floor. The neon lights made this place look even cheaper. We enter our room in disbelief. It felt like a prison. There were no real windows and the room had a weird smell. Not to mention, the dated furniture. We head back to the front desk to request a different room. We get a different room, not quite great but a little better. I do not recommend staying here. It is unbelievable the prices they charge for such a terrible place. This space should not be associated with The Chelsea. I recommend The Annex at the Chelsea be burned down and rebuilt.",Bad
"The Westin San Diego has no Customer service or satisfaction, at all. They only try to get as much money out of your pocket as possible, they are 100 inflexible, the response in communication is very slow, you need to send questions a couple time to get the right answers, they send important information last minute or after a couple time of re-asking, Pro-activity is certainly one thing they are not aware of and the capacity-chart they send is far beyond any reality.Lavalampe0815 - I am sorry to hear of your recent experience and would be happy to connect personally with you to further discuss.

"We stayed at this hotel last night while my grandfather was hospitalized because it was attatched to the Virginia Mason Hospital. The floors were so dirty that u could see the dirt sitting on top of the carpet, the mirrors were covered in dirty streaks, and the tub was full of leftover residue from recently removed no-skid strips! I have never been in a dirtier hotel room and am absolutely appalled that it is attatched to such an amazing hospital. The front counter staff was very kind and helpful but the state of the room was unbelievable. The toilet seat nearly slid off when I sat down and the wall plugs look like they're from the 1940s as we couldn't keep a single charger from falling out of the wall. It was an absolute waste of money I have spent nights in rooms that were half the price and twice as nice. Don't waste your money here - spend the night at one of the nicer hotels that are only 5 minutes down the road for less money and a better experience.Good morning. Thank you for your comments. As you can tell from previous trip advisor reviews, your stay is not the typical experience our guests enjoy. I have shared your comments with our housekeeping team - while the rooms are older, our staff works very hard to ensure rooms are thoroughly cleaned. It was a very busy weekend in Seattle and we are proud we are able to offer an affordable alternative for guests and family members seeking medical care. We hope your grandfather is feeling better. Good luck in your future travels, Carol Gallagher",Bad
"I can't believe this was a days inn. I tried to book a days inn near the convention center, and that's the location I clicked, but somehow it booked me at this location. Where to start... no phone, lamps didn't work, sheets didn't fit the bed, patched up tiles in the bathroom to cover holes (and none of it matched), exposed electrical outlets hanging out of the walls, housekeeping didn't clean anything (not even the toilet) during my stay. My rooms door had been pried opened, and hammered back to seal the door, Worst hotel I've ever been at.",Bad
"I stayed at The Chelsea AC (8/24/12-8/26/12) and have to say it was extremely disappointing. A group of 8 of us were there celebrating a Bachelorette Party for my sister. I work in the client service industry and have to say that the inappropriateness and rudeness of select members of the Chelsea AC staff was almost unbelievable. I was told I would be contacted by the manager of the hotel (Ms. Terry --) and lo and behold, we were unable to access any messages on our hotel phone (room 314- the button would not connect and I heard a busy signal) during our entire stay and even the front desk was unable to access them. I booked two rooms at The Chelsea in the Annex back in February via the hotel website and when we arrived, we did not receive the rooms as described: Two Queen - Pool View Balcony. I called down to Guest Services and they were able to move one of our rooms to the appropriate description, but our second one was unavailable. Then, I was sternly told that I shouldnt have booked our reservations on the hotel website, that I was paying way too much and that they wouldnt even comp a 15 parking charge for the trouble. I truly felt that Guest Services did not have any concern for our satisfaction. In fact, they made me feel bad for spending any money at the hotel period.The rooms had holes in the ceiling, missing refrigerators, mirrors. Very ghetto. After our stay, I contacted Ms. -- via email and she agreed to reimburse me for the difference in our room cost. I received a measly 78.44 back for the entire weekend after spending almost 350 per night per room. I requested that the parking charges be removed as well and never heard back or received a revised folio after multiple follow up emails to Ms. --. Hence, why I feel compelled to write this review. Beware! The regular hotel (the towers) seemed pretty nice. The Annex is an old, moldy motel with rude staff.",Bad
"I would never stay here again. The food at the basic breakfast buffet was good and the front desk was nice BUT the rooms were terrible. We were notPut in the tower but in the low rise Motel 6 type section. Bathroom was extremely small. (Door will hit your knee and you can touch the ceiling with the palm of your hand). Our rooms overlooked the pool and their was a connecting balcony along the outside of all rooms overlong pool. Did not like that feature or the bright lights kept on all balconies thru the night and the curtains poor design allowed for a lot of light tocome into the room. Sheets were too small for the bed and didn't even cover the mattress. Carpet on stairs to our floor was years past its replacement date. Walls thin. I could hear hairdryers etc in next room, kids having fun in the pool and planes from O'Hare at night. It was NOT a peaceful stay. For the cost of a Marriott stay you get a Motel 6 kinda roomDear Wendy Z,Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write to us about your most recent stay.

"This Hotel is not up to the standards my family is used to. The Front Desk staff were robotic and seemed annoyed. The Pool and spa were dirty and I got an attitude when I asked for pool towels. The evening social was a disappointment from what we have experienced from other Homewood Suites and the breakfast was lacking as well. The room was fine, a little outdated but the AC would turn on and off by itself and was really loud. One if the elevators broke down while my family was in it, luckily we were able to get out. This hotel is close to everything you want to do in the area, but i feel there may be a better choice somewhere else. We have had more than a few bad stays with the Hilton Brand lately. Not sure if I will continue being a Hilton Honors member. To top it all off, I wrote a review from the Trip Adviser link on my emailed receipt and it never got published. Not happy.",Bad

"We had a 5 am flight at Orlando airport, so decided to stay the night before at the Hilton garden in as it is a 5 minute drive to the airport. The hotel was perfect for that reason. We were unhappy with the quality of the room as it had not be serviced correctly. We were not an early check in. We checked in after 5 pm but our room had dried pee on the toilet and a used soap bar with hair on it in the shower. It is a simple fix for the hotel but just an awful experience when they make these mistakes to ready a room. The nightly fee for the room was 219 per night, so I have a higher expectation for the quality of the room for that price range. if it had been sub 100, the value would have offset the lack of quality controlOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to offer my sincerest apologies for the service issues in your room. There are no excuses for the issues you experienced. We have inspection procedures in place to make sure things like this don't occur and clearly we dropped the ball this time. I am working directly with our housekeeping supervisors to review and tighten current procedures to make sure that we deliver a superb stay every time.

"Stayed 2 nights for a conference. This hotel is very close to the airport. I used Lyft to get there and it took 9 minutes in morning traffic. The CTA blue line Cumberland stop is literally in their parking lot and I used it to get back to the airport. I also took it downtown to sightsee one night- was about a 35 minute ride to be dropped off right in the heart of the city by the riverwalk and magnificent mile. I was able to check in using the app at 9:00 and by lunchtime I had a room key and could grab a quick nap. Using the app I requested a shaving kit (an option listed as available) and a refrigerator which the website lists as available upon request. I received a chat message that a fridge was on the way up to the room and would be placed in the room. I left to sightsee and returned 7 hours later with a bottle of wine and left overs expecting to have somewhere appropriate to store them. There was no fridge or shaving kit in the room. I wouldn't mind but when they offer to provide me with anything I forgot (how do you fly with a razor nowadays anyhow) and tell me that something is on its way, then I expect it to be there. If they had replied that either were unavailable it wouldn't have been a big deal. Conference services were okay. Meeting rooms were comfortable temperatures. Food wasn't great but I passed other meetings with amazing looking food so I feel like my organization just picked the cheapest option. The grilled vegetable sandwich boxed lunch I was provided was quite good. No where around in walking distance for toiletries or food. Grub Hub was limited to a Denny's, several Mexican restaurants and a subway. Pretty much forced to travel to eat or eat at the hotel restaurant which is okay but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't probably stay here unless it was required for a conference or the location being by public transportation. Thank you for your review. As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay.

"We were looking for a last minute day trip for the president's day weekend and because it was last minute our top three choices were booked, so we decided on this inn. We booked a suite and the rooms were clean, had fresh towels and coffee throughout the stay the microwave and small fridge were also nice.On our 3rd night someone walked right into our room at about 2 in the morning!! OMG scared the living heck out of us informed the management in the a.m. he didn't seem too concerned, actually he seemed annoyed.Yes it is within walking distance of all the best places, but the breakfast is laughable, and I swear there are working girls/men or druggies who frequent this hotel, there is just too much foot traffic on the balcony at odd times of the night,the management is just plain rude, once you have paid your money you are out of luck and they don't care.

After reading that short term renting is a thing of the past I find myself with conflicting feelings. I stayed there many years ago the summer after 9-11. The place was a dive but all I did was sleep and store my stuff. I did several loads of washing in the basement and talked with several residents about the building and living in NY. It was great. Being so close to Lincoln Center and Central Park and the Subway was great. But I guess it will never happen again. Real Mixed feelings.,Bad

"The Chelsea itself is a pleasure to stay at, however, stay clear of The Annex. The Chelsea and it's owners (same as Congress Hall in Cape May) should be mortified having their name associated with this wing of the hotel. It felt like a low budget refugee motel. Upon entering our room we promptly called the front desk and had our room upgraded to the other side of The Chelsea and out of The Annex. The whole feel of the Annex was dirty, banged-up and worn out. The bathroom was something straight out of the 70's and not the boho-chic 70's. The furniture in the room was below standard and reminded me of poor garage sale finds. If The Annex underwent a huge refresher...you would have a gem on your hands.",Bad

"I suppose you get what you pay for. Rooms appear clean but are small. Pricing is still a bit high for what you get. Rooms are a bit noisy and you can hear others' in hallways and in adjacent rooms. The only perk is the free breakfast, which is just okay.The thing that really bothered me about this property was the shuttle service. So, they advertise they have shuttle service, but if you don't tell the front desk at least a half day ahead of time they tell you that they ain't got you down on the shuttle log and they act like they are doing you a favor to get a ride back to the airport on the top of the hour.

"Stayed here from Wednesday through Saturday February 27th till March 2nd. We had a roll away bed in the room and it had bed bugs, which means they can be anywhere in this hotel. Not getting much of an answer from the Hotel manager on this one, was supposed to call me but hasn't. Our toilet was broken and had to be plunged three times while we were there, we just gave up and used the toilet in the restaurant downstairs, which was hard to get to because the elevator was broken the entire time we were there. Not a great experience. The photo is actual if I wanted to fake one off the internet I would pick one that looked worse, actual bedbug bites from The Sheraton Four Points New Orleans on Bourbon St.We inspected every roll-away bed in our inventory and found no infestation of any kind. We also checked for substances that may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. Again we found nothing. Our hotel is regularly serviced by a reputable extermination organization that provides reports of any pest findings. We answer all consumer concern calls but no one has attempted to contact me or my management staff on this matter.",Bad

"We were looking for a place to stay in San Francisco for the family (3 kids) and found Royal Pacific Motor Inn on hotels.com. I compared the price at hotels.com with the price if I were to book directly at the hotel on their own web-site. The price was almost the same (156 USD + tax, total 186 USD incl. tax), but I made the booking through hotels.com because there it was clear that we could stay 5 people in the room (often there is a limit of four persons which makes it a bit difficult if you have three children). At check out time they wanted to charge me 215 USD per night incl tax, that is almost 30 USD extra per night. They refused to acknowledge that my price was given including tax. So they have charged me two times for the tax.This is a kind of discussion you don't want to end up with during a vacation so make sure you have a correct quote if staying here. Otherwise the hotel was OK.",Bad
"We stayed at La Hacienda because it was close to the SafeCo field and we had to get to a Mariner's game. We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad, with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty, there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds, as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.",Bad

"Checked in VERY LATE on a Friday night and we were assigned a smoking room with a king bed even though we did not request one. We were reassigned to a non-smoking room with two beds. Night clerk was very friendly and accommodating. Next day, we placed do not disturb sign on door as we had checked in really late. Approximately 11:00, we left room and went out to have lunch. Returned to room approximately 2:00 pm and discovered that room had not been cleaned. I called office and told them we needed our room cleaned and also informed the maid as she was in the room next door. The front desk clerk this time was very rude and told us that it was our fault since we had placed the sign on the door. When we returned to room at 10:00 pm, we found the room had not been touched. Night clerk said he could do nothing for s but did offer to bring us fresh towels. This hotel will NEVER get a single penny of my money again. The maids are inept and management is badly lacking.Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel, and thank you for your feedback. As the new manager of this property, I'm very interested in what our guests have to say. First, let me apologize for the confusion regarding the bed types service in the room you reserved. This is a training issues that I will definitely address with my front desk staff. We are working diligently to make improvements to our property, including retraining in every department. Our goal is a guest experience that creates loyalty.Please know that I am doing everything I can to make that a reality. And it's guests like you, that give honest and fair feedback, that make it possible. So thank you again, and we would love the opportunity to show you how we've improved. Hope to see you again soon!",Bad

I traveled for business and this hotel rated at 3 stars with corporate booking too. I had to store my suitcase on my bed the rooms are so tiny. The elevator is barely functional so be prepared to hall your suitcase. The fitness center has one out dated treadmill and a few weights and equipment that doesn't work. Good Nob Hill location but better off staying in Union Square for better value.,Bad
"Booked online at the last minute. The hallways reek of cigarette and marijuana smoke, the hand towel was dirty with a lip stock kiss mark, there were fleas in the air conditioner unit, breakfast was substandard.

"Kimpton Hotels are an amazing brand if you never have tried them I would recommend it!Hipster hotels, free wine/beer hour, great style and good experience most of the time...With that said we booked months in advance and worked with NickHotel Solamar on this being a special birthday weekend and we wanted a room with a view of the ball park as we where coming in to scout the hotel for a major event happening in Feb 2015 Petco Stadium.This was Labor Day weekend but we checked in on Sunday mid day and it was train wreckLine of people 20 deep waiting outside for valet, so it kept people from being able to get in, no bell staff helping new people coming in only people leavingWe stood there 15+ min before I had to yell to get a bell men to help No staff to open big massive doors and we had to drag in our own luggage By the time we get to front desk the agent seemed a little put off with helping out and told us our room would not be ready for a few hours then points back out side to stand in line to get luggage stored Seriously You would think in a big weekend you would have managers or assistant manager downstairs directing the chaos but didn't see anyone of authority Its now 5p and we get a call our room is finally ready so we come back in to the same person and she is still in a put off mood and never tells us about the pool, free bicycles to use, the wine/beer happy hour etcIts interesting that some younger people in the hospitality industry forget how big a part they can play in a customer experience after all most of us our on pleasure vacations at the time we come and interact.The hotel itself in beautiful deep wood tones, velvet, lot of room and open space which for downtown San Diego is rare! The room itself was very big (King special) very nice open with big windows that...wait for it...Over looked a massive construction site the website doesnt warn you about nore did the front desk etcSo be warned its a high rise coming so this build may take years do not get a room on the north. The pool was nice but not a lot of shade and it was hot that day. Great Happy Hour on Sunday/Monday holiday.Staff was hit and miss some could care less when you came and went and no interaction. Bell men never greeted or open the doors which when you have packages from shopping, a dog etc...its simply courtesy! Crystal the from desk was so nice stopping us asking how are day was, where had we gone, and always had a treat for our dog!There is a lot of places to eat in the area, lot to do, light rail is right down the street, Petco Stadium is a block away, convention center 2 blk away, Horton plaza a 20 min walk.Would we stat again..I dont think so, with Hard Rock, Omni, Hilton Bayside, even the Hyatt Grand at the other end of downtown there is just to many options for other hotel when you have bad service that didn't live up to the Kimpton Experience.Side note the management comp the room etc after that fact which was thoughtful but hoping a major retraining on hospitality going forward.Dear RollPositive Thank you for your feedback from your visit over Labor Day weekend. As previously mentioned in our prior correspondence, we agree, it was a busy weekend and we could have certainly done a better job to be prepared. We are happy to share that we have addressed this opportunity with our leaders and are better prepped for the future. Thank you again for your feedback.Terry BuchholzGeneral Manager",Bad
"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Bad

"Never had such bad experience before. Stayed in this hotel for 9 nights, there were so many incidents happened during my stay.First night, I requested double room when I check in, they gave me three times twin room.And I asked for a room with the view, they said I have to pay 6USD extra, which I agreed, then I found it was much more than what I have been told. Second night, I was being locked outside of my room. After changing the key card three times, they found out that it was the lock issue,they asked me to wait in the lobby till midnight, and then arranged me a room next door,which was not even cleaned thoroughly. Yuk, imagine that sleeping at a room with someone else left belongings.Third day, I was being notified that the lock of my room was fixed, so I can move back to my own room, such a relief, I was wondering what I am gonna do if I couldnt get back to my room, since all my stuffs are there. So I took a quick shower before going back to my room. Guess what I have found out when I change back to my own room The door was left unlocked and nobody was there!!! I had to quick check if anything was missing. Just when I decided to relax a bit in my room, someone came in my room without even knocking my door. He left immediately when he saw I was in the room without saying a word. I went to ask what that was for, he told me he just want to confirm if I need room service. I think that makes sense, and I answered yes, I need. but why didnt he knock first I went out for sightseeing during the day, when I get back to the room, it was exact the same as I left, nobody came to clean it. So I called them to ask why they didnt do the housekeeping since they came to my room specifically to ask if I require room service, which I answered yes, in the morning. They did send someone over to do it though after that phone call.Fourth day, since I thought they just did the cleaning the late night before, I left my room with DND sign on the door. Guess what happened My room was cleaned!!! Whats more, I was locked in the elevator for nearly ten minutes that night, and I had to call for help.Fifth day, I found my credit card has been charged by the hotel with a strange amount of money. So I called them to ask why. The person who answered the phone said they will investigate and get back to me. I was waiting and waiting, still no answer, until I get back to the hotel at the night, I had to explain myself again with what happened to another their staff. Yet, still no answer.Sixth day, they charged my credit card again, which makes me so furious, since they just did whatever they want without asking for my permission. Seventh day, after I called four times, finally, they found the reason why my credit card has been charged.Because they didnt preauthrize enough money when I checked in, so they have to do it again and again. I said why it is different amount of money then, they couldnt give me a straight answer. And when I asked why they didnt inform me first Yet, no straight answer.Eighth night, I have been charged again, but I could guess what it was for already.The check out day was the most smooth day during my entire stay. I asked them to print my bill. And I am so glad that I did.To be fair, the location of this hotel is really nice, since it is just next to the Space Needle. The breakfast is too blunt. Strong smell of the decoration for not only the lobby, also the room. But the attitude of their staff is really good. And they are actually quite helpful. So I wasnt going to write my experience until today when I saw the final invoice I was being charged around 60USD for parking fee. Ironically, I dont even have a driving license, and I have never drove a car!!! This is soooooooo ridicules. I have stayed in many hotels in variety locations around the world, never suffered as badly as in this hotel. Worst experience ever and super disappointed.Dear mgx2222,Thank you so much for choosing to stay at Hyatt Place during your recent trip to Seattle. I would like to first and foremost apologize on behalf of the hotel and entire staff for the unsatisfactory experience you encounter during your recent visit. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. I could make excuses about the newness of the hotel and the lack of experience of our staff, but that doesnt rectify your inconvenience. Its important for us to hear the feedback from our guests, as we want to improve and make the necessary changes that lead to positive experiences. We are addressing these concerns with the appropriate departments. We always want to be a part of great travel memories. Please let us know when you come back to Seattle as we would love to welcome you back!Sincerely, Sarah Junge",Bad

"First off, Id like to say that the staff here was friendly and accommodating. But thats about the only positive with my experience.You generally know what youre getting with a Residence Inn. Thats why I stay at them frequently. I had never experienced anything like this one before. Inside the hotel its dated and dirty. Outside the hotel room its run down and pure ghetto.Many hotels are close to a freeway or interstate. This one is no exception. The difference: its like right there, right outside my window. It was very difficult to sleep at night due to the traffic. Moreover, sirens seemed to be going off constantly. Ive attached a photo to show how close the freeway really is, and you can see an emergency vehicle with its lights and sirens blaring.I tried to go outside for a walk yesterday. Bad idea! Cop cars everywhere and the neighborhood didnt seem very safe. Im not sure what a Residence Inn is doing in this area, anyway. Seems like it needs to be torn down and built somewhere completely different.The inside of the room and the whole property are incredibly dated and dirty. Here are a few examples.See attached photo of a TV in the bedroom. Its so smallbasically the size of an average computer monitor. I havent seen a TV that small in a hotel room since the 80s.Another attached photo is of the pillow case. Looks like theres either blood or pizza sauce on it. Im not sure which one, and I probably dont want to know.Another attached photo shows just one area (the vent by the kitchen) and how dusty/dirty it is.These are just a few examples. Overall, Im very disappointed and would never even consider staying here again. The worst part is, I traveled with some co-workers who are staying at a Homewood Suites down the road. Im a Marriott guy so I went out of my way to stay here. Their hotel ended up being MUCH nicer.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience and our opportunity for improvement. I will address these areas with our team since these items should have been resolved prior to your arrival. I apologize for a less than expected guest experience.Our guest stay and experience is important to us so we will look at ways to improve our cleaning and inspection processes to that we do not cause disruption to our guest.

"I'm a Marriott Platinum Elite member. I stay at Marriott hotels 100+ nights each year. I gave this hotel a try in May of 2016. It's a nice, modern hotel in a good location, with all the amenities typically found at a Springhill Suites.However.....the Air Conditioning unit couldn't cool the room. I ran it all night and it never succeeded in getting the room temp below 70 degrees.Hotels MUST allow their guests to keep the room at the temperature they desire. This means installing AC units that are powerful enough to cool the rooms to the desired temp.This Marriott failed in that regard, and thus I cannot recommend, nor do I plan to return.This is so disappointing to see, and I'm so sorry that your room wasn't up to par. My team and I would have been more than happy to fix it in the moment, but I appreciate the feedback nonetheless. I hope you can give us another shot to show you the stay you deserve.

"Well trip was booked without looking here first. Figured ok well we will go and see how it is thinking it is only to sleep and rest. Got to room and lights didnt work, patio door was a nightmare to open. to mini frig, very poor service in diner, room was almost alive with smells and dirt. We stayed from Sun to Wed. now the diner service was very bad but had 30 daily for food and was not going to let it go to waste. But the wait was long and slow. Staff seemed to be more interested in texting or smoking or anything but service. Housekeeping seemed to be doing best they could with available supplies. Seen floor cleaner sitting in hall on 1st floor for almost 24 hours. The bed itself was not to bad. Always go on trips with my own pillows as i hate the ones in hotels. Internet was worse than dial up.

"The room was clean and the staff was friendly. The way the rooms were set up made it easy to get turned around and lost. Because we got the managers special are breakfast was not included.

Thank you for your sharing your experience. We never want anyone leaving our hotel feeling disappointed so for that, I am sorry. Regarding your question about breakfast, we offer a complimentary breakfast for those that book directly on the hotels website as well as AAA/AARP guests.

"My husband and I visited Atlanta, and just finished our 5 night stay at this hotel. They overbooked, so our double was upgraded to a king suite. Score!The location was good, right off 75. There was a mall, Walgreen's and several restaurants nearby. And you can't beat free parking, wireless and breakfast - and a microwave and small fridge in the room!Unfortunately, I have to give them a lower rating for the room itself. We were a little lost at first because our room did not have a number posted. After a little walking up and down the hall at 10:30PM, we figured it out. The room had a funky smell. Not really bad, just smelled weird. It was much more humid in our room than the rest of the hotel. I think the room air conditioning unit was not working properly. Cable did not work, so we could not watch TV (Not really a bad thing, who wants to watch TV on vacation anyway So we never called to have it fixed). The bathtub faucet dripped constantly. There was lots of trash under and around the bed - paper towels shoved between under the headboard, between the wall and mattress, bits of paper and wrappers, a wooden coffee stir stick. The entire time there it was never cleaned out. Some liquid had been splashed on the headboard and dried. That was also never cleaned off. The cherry on top was I went to use one of the new wash cloths replaced by housekeeping, and found a hair stuck in it that clearly did not belong to me or my husband.FYI elevators can be a little scary - very slow to open! We never got stuck, but there were a few times I was not so sure...It was OK for the price we paid, but I wouldn't stay there again. Next time we will try another hotel in the area.",Bad

"While this place is relatively inexpensive, it isn't worth the savings! As soon as we walked in, we noticed the room smelled like urine. There was no remote for the tiny television, the towels looked worn and unclean, the mattress was as hard as a rock, there is no ventilation (no ac, no fan) in the room and there are no screens on the windows. The worst part was that we were attacked by mosquitoes all night! The tub didn't drain properly (while I was showering, I was standing in several inches of water) and the bath mat for the outside of the tub was a piece of paper! It is a shame because it is obviously a hotel that has been in SF for a long time, and could be charming if the owners took better care of it. We will never stay here again.",Bad

I didmt like the fact that it wasn't possible to open the windows in the room.englishmaninmidtown - It is unfortunate to read you did not enjoy your recent experience at the Westin San Diego. The hotel completed a 15 million renovation in 2014 which included our public areas, meeting space and guestrooms. We are a high rise building in a large downtown city, therefore our building windows do not open. There is an air vent at the window to allow for outside air but the windows unfortunately do not open. This feature assists with noise control as well providing our guests with a heavenly nights rest.I hope you will continue to look to Westin's when traveling as I truly believe our brand and its offerings are the best in the industry.

"The room was ok. I stayed there from Friday to Monday. We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy.

"This is the 3rd time I have been to Florida and the 1st ...and last time I will stay at the Orlando Continental!!My party was 5 adults and the room did have two double beds which was fine, but my 16 yr old son had to sleep on a rollaway camp style bed with his legs hanging off the edge!!The air con, was up the creek and was either too hot or too cold and very very noisy! Every day when we came back to the room after visiting the theme parks the walls were wet, all our clothes were wet and the beds were wet!Our view from the room window was a blank wall and therefore the room was always dark.The free breakfast in the morning was a joke, with a free for all for the toast, fighting for seating and a real cattle market. The pool was very small and you could not swing a cat in the games room (I use the term 'games' loosely) because the room is about 6ft by 4ft!).To be fair the only 'good' point with this hotel is the location. It is right on International Drive and takes about 30 seconds to get to wet n wild so you can walk there and save on parking.I ended up staying one extra night in florida, so I stayed in the Holiday Inn which is also on International Drive, about 500m up the road. What a pleasure! I thought I was in Heaven!!In conclusion, I would say, only stay here if you really really really don't mind the quality of the hotel and want a cheap hotel to rest your head at night.",Bad
"Stayed here for one night before leaving town. The room was OK. Although we had a minor plumbing issue and we were just handed the tools to fix it ourselves. Otherwise, the night was quiet and the room was fairly well kept. Just an OK stay.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar San Diego. We appreciate you bringing up your concerns with our property as well and apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused. We are happy to hear that your room was fairly well kept. We strive to work hard in providing a well maintained property and are glad that you took notice. Thank you again for reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar San Diego. We hope to see you during your next trip to San Diego. Thank you!",Bad
"I had two of my employees stay at the hotel form mid Sept to mid November. After coming from another hotel where there were no issues, thy began to have allergic reactions. After several thousand dollars in doctor bills we found that the room was infested with bed bugs. They moved my two employees to another room, which they had to do since they would not refund the payment, but then made them wash all their own cloths several times and made it known that the problem was not theirs but that my employees had brought them in with them. There was no compensation for the trouble or expense and the humiliation was uncalled for. So be prepared that if you stay here, that whatever goes wrong is your fault and nothing of the hotels responsibility and that you should be glad they even let you stay in their marginal hotel. I will make sure none of my employees ever stay there again. Also, tremendous noise and dust from the many construction sites around with no reduction in monthly rate due to the noise.Dear Bud PThank you for choosing us, as Weve told you before, as soon as we were notified about the situation, management were on top of the issue, and we are grateful that our pest control company was notified, checked all your luggage finding that the bed bugs were in your luggage and we were able to content and fix the situation changing you of rooms immediately. We are glad that you decided to extend your stay with us and we are able to have you as our guest for another extra month. We hope you enjoyed our complementary fruits and twice a week cleaning.",Bad

"I am writing the review at the hotel. Lets just put aside the inconvenience of the location aside at the moment. I chose to stay here inside of the south beach because I want a quiet hotel but guess what, there are plane flying over my head every ten minutes! And guess what, when I called the front desk they told me they have never heard any plane noise. I went down to talk to the manager on duty and he claimed he has never had any complaints and he has been working here for two years. They are treating me as if I made this up. I invited the manager on duty to go to my room to prove that there are planes noise every ten minutes. He heard it himself very inevitably and instead of trying to solve the problem, simply told me that there is nothing he can do about the planes. I told him that I am aware of it but is the other side of the hotel going to be better I asked. Of course he can't answer the questions since he claimed no guests have complained about the noise before...well they must all be deaf. I requested to check the rooms on the other side of the hotel. We went together and it's slightly better, the catch is its facing a main road and there is traffic. I truly dislike how they handle my complaints. Now lets get to some other technical issue. The vents of the air conditioning blows directly to the bed onto my head so I can't turn any air conditioning on. By the way they don't give you adapters, they are part of the minibar item so you need to purchase them. Not to mention that one needs to purchase wifi connection. That is the least of the problems. By the way I asked the manager on duty in light of the noise of planes on the one side and the traffic on the other side of the hotel, which is the lesser of two evils for an insomniac like me. He said it would be the side facing traffic. Oh so he finally heard the plane noise So I didn't make it up after all! Shame on this mandarin oriental. The chain should disown this property to preserve its standard. Do not stay here!Dear Ms. Yao,I am very sorry to read of the noise disturbance you encountered which has also been brought to my attention by our Front Office Manager and our Rooms Division Director, who has tried contacting you.Please understand that Mandarin Oriental, Miami was built with the highest of standards and to withstand category five hurricane force winds.We are an urban city resort, tucked away on a semi private island, away from the traffic noise of downtown and the South Beach festive scene. We have never received a report from our guests of air traffic noise since the hotel opened and if you review other Trip Advisor reports, there has not been such an incident.I would like to assist in making the remainder of your stay seamless and enjoyable and would like to speak with you. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to see what we can do to help make your stay a restful one.Kind regards,Greg NunezHotel Manager",Bad

"DISGUSTING DUMP! If this hotel is an example of the Ramada chain the health department should shut them down. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I shall never visit another Ramada hotel again. The room stinks. I am guessing the carpets have never been cleaned. The room was not cleaned. The bathroom is filthy. The tv gets 4 channels and stopped working the second day. The elevator does not work so all luggage had to be taken up to the top floor by hand. The phone does not work, the sheets are full of holes and the curtains smell. DO NOT STAY AT RAMADA HOTELS. I believe deseases cold be hatching in the rooms. Where is the San Francisco health department to protect the public Health department and tourist bureau start doing your job, SHUT THE DUMP DOWN NOW!.",Bad
"The staff was great, the rooms nice looking, but unfortunately the entire hotel has a foul odor.

"I have stayed at this hotel once or twice a year for quite some time. Its a decent hotel, nothing spectacular, unless you want to get drunk and ride a mechanical bull at the bar really, but other than that its a decent hotel. I recently booked a room online, where I was charged immediately, but there is also now... More",Bad
"Let me start with the positives. Its located next to the Tropicana. Now the negatives. It started with the 1920's elevator. You only need to ride it once to prefer climbing the stairs. It shimmies and sways for the whole ride. The stairwell and halls are dark. Thank goodness for the pink neon lights. The room was small but it was relatively clean. No stains on the beds or towels like other people found. They call this the social end of the hotel. First, its a motel and second, social means.. people that pay for rooms by the hour. Normally when you check out of a hotel, the desk clerk asks how your stay was... I guess they don't ask questions they don't want to answer to. If we had only paid 60 or less for the room I wouldn't be complaining. We got a living social deal and it was too much for this room. So if you can get this room for less than 60 then its worth it if for nothing else but the location. Word to the wise, take the stairs, dont bring a black light and sleep with one eye open.",Bad
Not what I expected our room felt like it was in a basement damp and humid so much so that the bathroom door didn't even close all the way Window air conditioner sounded like a freight train kept us up all night Free breakfast and laundry on site were nice,Bad
"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Bad
"using AARP rate, room over looking I-4, noise all night, one themostat did not work, 10 pm it was worked on, but not much better, coffee maker did not work, upon checking out, my wife forgot a new pair of LL Beans slcaks on the bed, called a couple of hours later, no one knew anything, repeated calls yielded no responce. After repeated calls emails to Hilton and hotel nothing . They jusst dont care about theirt customers.We're very sorry to hear about the unpleasant experience you had while staying with us. It's our goal to provide great service and accommodations to all of our guests and we certainly dropped the ball.

This review is the average of the two rooms my family stayed at on this property. Our first room was terrible. The first thing you notice was the smell of the room. It smelled as bad as a mildew basement. The walls looked as if it was a patchwork of wall paper. Its only redeeming feature was the comfortable bed... More,Bad

"I will never stay at this hotel again as many things were either hard to turn on or not in working order. No coffee at breakfast as machine was broke, no sign hung on the machine saying that it was out of order. Cool shower every day. Stayed close to office and doors were being slammed all night long.Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future.",Bad
"The only concern that I had was the cleaning service left our hotel room door open while we were away. When we came back, luckily nothing was missing. I would suggest using the safe the hotel provides at NO additional charge.All in all, I found that for the price the location was great. It is directly across the street from the tram entrance and main gate entrance to the two parks. The best thing I found was the Denny's restaurant located at the entrance to the hotel parking lot.",Bad
We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.,Bad
"Stayed in the 'annex' rooms. FIRST OF ALL... the elevators weren't working!! So we all had to lug our luggage up to the 4th floor!! (seriously) Walked in and it looked like an old dirty motel room that they attempted to cover up with a fresh coat of paint (that wasn't really working-chips and marks everywhere) and some cheap 'mod' furniture. When they say that the hotel is retro, it really means they were too cheap to update it from the 60s 2 star motel it must have been previously. My friends and I tried to ignore it and wanted to listen to some music and have some drinks before heading out. The ice machine wasn't working either! big surprise... okay, so what about the Ipod dock it said would be in the room None to be found... called down to the front desk and told them to get us one.. got a call back saying sorry they are all out tonight. COOL. What else The mirror that they show in the online picture above the tv/dresser wasn't there! There is only one tiny mirror in the gross bathroom. This place is really just pathetic.",Bad
"After reading the mixed reviews I wanted to give this one a try. I stayed 2 nights before moving to Park Vue. The room was a king, very small, and fixed up, but it looked fixed up. Some parts you could tell was old. It was clean and ok for the location. I paid 74.98 each night. If I had a car I would have stayed at Motel 6 instead for about 50.00 a night and it is nicer and larger than Del Sol. When I arrived I wasn't to impress with front desk. He had run my credit card already before I arrived for one night. Most run it when you arrive. I did want to use a different card, and he started to run it - then told me he had run the other. I got the slip and made sure I tore it up, so I wouldn't get double charge. The room is definitely blah, but I didn't expect lots for what I was paying. I wanted to compare it and the Park Vue. I would only go back to Del Sol for the location and only if I could for some reason not afford the Park Vue. I have seen Del Sol priced as high as 100 night on the web. That is way too much. Even the jazucci at Park Vue with great planning far in advance was only 108.00 a night and the King or double queen can be as low as 81.00.I personally think this room at Del Sol would have been good for 1 person. I couldn't imagine being closed in with kids. I won't be returning, but if you get a 50.00 price and want clean and don't mind being no breathing space go for it - the location is good, but Park Vue is also closer.If possible no matter where you stay book as early as you can. The closer it gets the higher the room goes. I already booked for next year Park Vue jacuzzi suite for 98.00 in August.Happy Planning......",Bad
"Was not able to run hot water from shower - was told by staff just to let water run for 20+ minutes and then it would be hot.

"This hotel has many good points, most notably its location. Unfortunately, it also has some aspects that didn't live-up to expectation. The parking was free, which in any downtown hotel is a good thing. Sadly, many of the cars are double-parked, which means leaving the key with reception. When we were ready to check-out, we had to wait for ten minutes for the receptionist to find the missing keys to a van that was blocking our exit. The 'free' breakfast wasn't much more than a small table containing coffee, tea bags, hot water and a few pastries (the table sitting in the hotel's lobby which had two chairs). The room was a little scruffy too. The decor was old, the fabrics were very faded and our entrance to the hotel seemed to be held together by the construction that was taking place. If you're looking for a cheap hotel in Downtown SF, this place is ok, just don't expect much.",Bad
"My wife and I were just staying at the hotel for one night and believe me when I say I didn't expect much to begin with because you get what you pay for, which is fine.I just needed an economical stay for one night - that's all.Well this one night stay turned out to be a nightmare!1) We arrived very late because our flight got delayed into San Fran. When we finally got to the hotel it was after midnight and there was one attendant working the front desk.As he was checking us in, the hotel system went down. The man spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out what to do and could not check us in at all. When he finally had everything back up, it all went down again which led to a much longer wait just to get our room. We finally got our room key well past 1am, which was after more than an hour of waiting.2) This next issue makes the first one seem like nothing.Our room was on the 3rd floor and the next morning I wanted to go move my car closer to our room. I called up the one and only elevator they have in the place and took it down to the main floor. Well just before I got to the first floor the elevator just stopped. I realized It was stuck. It is a very small and old elevator which made me feel so claustrophobic! I pressed all the buttons trying to go back up, open the door, the alarm button and what not. I even knocked on the door and screamed for help.I was in the elevator for about 10 minutes but it seemed like an hour and no one came to my assistance. Finally I kept holding the door open button and the door opened a crack and I pushed it open the rest of the way. It was on the ground floor thankfully so I was able to walk out. I had a did that just happen moment and was in total shock.What was even more shocking was that there was a sign on the first floor noting the the elevator was out of service! That's great but where was the frickin sign on the second and third floors Who was the genius that decided one sign would be enoughI got to the front desk and spoke with the man on duty and explained the situation. All he said was that he's new and he will put signs on the other floors (better late than never) and that the manager wasn't in that day so they would reach out to me.I took the manager's email address just in case. We checked in and got the hell out of there.Well it's been a week now and I haven't heard anything from management at all. In fact I emailed them a few days ago explaining why I had such a horrible situation to give them a chance to address it and I've gotten nothing back.I realize the elevator situation and the system going down might just be bad luck but it's how the staff responded that makes me upset. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever.If you decide to stay here don't expect service you'd get from an average hotel. It's far worse.",Bad

"I did not feel safe at this hotel. Their shuttle took forever to arrive at the airport, took 2 calls to find out where they were, and was so old and rickety I couldn't talk on my cell phone. The lobby night club attracts an unsavory crowd and people are lurking around everywhere. The halls are dark. The front desk is covered with graffiti and the staff couldn't answer basic questions. My room furniture was covered in vinyl upholstery with lights around the bed. Everything is painted black. The bathroom needs a total make-over. Somehow they thought I'd be fooled by a new shower curtain. I didn't even consider eating in the restaurant. If others liked this hotel, I'd question their taste and travel experience.

I do not recommend this hotel for anyone who values customer service or safety. The staff is not accommodating or friendly. There is a huge crime problem here and the management does not bat an eye. There is no security or concern for those staying here. The manager did not even attempt to contact us when our car was broken into on the property. Break-ins are a regular enough occurrence here that the Sheriff's office patrols at night regularly. If you value your vacation stay do not stay here.,Bad
"This was the second time I stayed here. The first time everything was fine. This time in room 1509, the neighbors on each side were very loud. The first night on one side I called the front desk and they eventually quieted down. The third night was horrible! We called the front desk 3 times around 11 AM and the people never quieted down. We had to play music to fall asleep. Then at 3:30 AM they were noisy again. When we called again, the new front desk person was not aware of the issue. She offered to move us, but at that point with an early departure, it wasnt worth it. They claimed they sent security, but no results. They said they would refund my room, but in the morning, when I mentioned our problem to the front desk person, she made no mention of it and I had to run to catch a plane.If you are a heavy sleeper, it is a very nice hotel. Small city-size rooms are nicely decorated. Beds are comfortable. They have a nice lobby bar with alcoves where groups can meet. Lucy, the bartender, is very nice and provided excellent service to our group the first time we stayed there. She was very friendly this time as well. From 5-6pm, they offer a free wine happy hour, so the ambiance is nice and lively. No room service, but the lobby bar offers snacks you can bring up to the room. We wanted to schedule our annual company meeting there but although they had well-appointed conference rooms, the catering restrictions were insurmountable. We had a group of 10 people, and they had the perfect room, but wouldnt offer a good value for the forced catering spend. We ended up getting a room at Riva on the Navy Pier, and had a continental breakfast and three course lunch and excellent service vs. a very skimpy offering at Allegro for the same spend. It would have been so much easier to keep it all in the same place, but just not worth it. If you have money to burn on a large expense account, it would probably be a nice place for a conference, as long as your guests are heavy sleepers.If you are traveling and are a heavy sleeper, it is a nice hotel. The thin walls were really puzzling and disappointing.",Bad

"On a good note, this place has nice hot water, the AC keeps the room nice and cold, the staff are helpful, room service seemed to be very efficient, the beds are comfortable enough, and the one meal I had here was pretty good.On the flip side, our room had bugs (most likely due to the gaping crack around the door), a lot of the outlets did not work, the tub always looked like it had sand in the bottom, and the carpeting looks like it is in bad need of replacement.Solely based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place to anyone. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are however, pleased to hear you enjoyed our comfortable beds as well as our helpful and efficient staff. Hopefully you will consider staying with us again in the future so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!",Bad

"This is by far the worst wedding vendor I've work with while planning my wedding. I'm planning my wedding in San Diego from NYC and chose Estancia as my hotel for out of town guests. BIG Mistake!!! I was initially going to hold two events here during my wedding weekend but they are being held at another hotel because of the poor service. Initially the venue was beautiful with such a luxurious pool spa. The group sales manager was responsive until the contract for the room block was signed and then it began to take a long time to return emails or phone calls. The Group event manager John never said congratulations or made me feel special. I know this property holds a lot of events but I seriously felt like a number and super unimportant. The group rate sounded like a good deal when we initially spoke. John from Estancia told me the rate was about 50 less per night than they charge in July. But my guests easily found the same room online for 50-80 per night below the contracted rate so they booked online and did not use my room block link. The room block was suppose to be a better deal for a large group. However, Estancia has a clause that if guests aren't booking rooms at the hotel the bride can be held financially responsible. My guests booked rooms at the hotel be did it not at my contracted rate since it was higher than their advertised price online. The group sales manager called me to talk about how very few of the rooms had been booked for my block. I told him that guests were booking online to get a better deal. I asked to have the online rate matched. He threatened to sue me per the contract unless guests booked under my block. Apparently it's in the contract that the Hotel Estancia's revenue goals are not met then the bride groom will be presented with a bill that if they don't pay they will immediately be sued even if the rooms are rented by other guests or if guests of the wedding make reservations outside the hotel block. How rude! I tried to get someone else or a manager of this manager but no one would help me. I called several times for a few weeks. I tried the front desk and the 800 number but kept getting this same guy John so I basically gave up and moved on with the event planning. I thought the group rate was supposed to be a discount compared to what guests can book themselves. at least that's what they told me when speaking with group sales initially. It seems like Estancia is going to meet their revenue goals for my wedding so good for them but it's really been at my expense. Several awesome friends were nice enough to cxl online reservations and move to my room block so we would meet the minimum to not get sued by the Estancia because the revenue requirements for the room block are not met. But this was really embarrassing to have to tell my wedding guests that we would be sued they didn't change their reservations to pay more per nigh!!!About a month later, I asked if we could get group transporting to the wedding venue and the group sales wrote an excruciatingly long winded email that basically said they don't do group transportation to weddings. Which is odd because when we toured the property they showed us a Mercedes Van for group transportation to events....This time I absolutely lost it with them and was really fed up. I talked to a friend who suggested that I call Bacarra. So I called the sister resort and told them what was going on and asked for help getting ahold of someone else with Estancia. Got the Hotel GM's email number and they finally agreed to use the Van to take guests to the wedding. They are still not very responsive and seem to be grudgingly polite with me. IThe sales manager of managers Brad seems to be somewhat easier to deal with and he did say congratulations which was very refreshing. However, we are still technically under the required number of rooms for our event. The Estancia agreed to allow a couple guests to be listed under our reservation even though they booked outside of our wedding block. I've asked for updated reports again to prove we are now at the contracted number of rooms but they are very unresponsive. I'm trying to document everything as they already verbally threatened me with legal action. I really hope this all works itself out and that we have a reasonable solution to all this. Initially I wanted to have my spa day before the wedding and post wedding brunch with Estancia as well as my welcome party. But due to the problems with communication I moved forward with other event spaces. You guys have a beautiful property. I wish the communication was warmer and that brides were treated with greater care kindness by your team.I have written 3 emails and made several calls to the hotels General Manager, Mairead Hennessy about this and have received no response from her. I still don't have updated reports from the hotel to prove that we are meeting The Estancia's revenue goals for our room block even though I have reached out extensively for several days. I called 7 times yesterday and sent many emails to the group sales team. My wedding date is less than 2 weeks away and this is so unbelievable.",Bad
"Was travelling down to San Francisco on business and booked two hotel rooms at the last minute - all paid and confirmed...or so we thought. We showed up in a rush between meetings and the front desk informed us that we didn't have rooms any more because the people staying in our rooms had extended their stay! Hotel was supposed to find us rooms elsewhere but we ended up scrambling to find two other rooms. Disappointed as we always like to try and find the hidden jewel but this time we certainly found something else. Guess squatters rights still exist in San Francisco!Dear Nathan M-Let me first say that I appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback following your recent experience with us. Secondly, let me apologize and say that I wish that we were able to have accomodated you and your colleague at the Hotel Abri. Not being able to honor a reservation for a guest is the least desireable and most difficult situation for the hotel as well as the guest. We had a group of rooms extend that caused us a bit of a situation. I believe that when you arrived we were in the middle of securing accomodations for you at a neighboring hotel, but I understand how disappointing this was as you had already picked the Abri and we were unable to welcome you in the way we wish we could have. I hope that when your travels return you to San Francisco, you will give us a second chance. Please feel free to contact me or the hotel directly for future reservations, as we have a lowest rate guarantee, and always offer the lowest rate available thru any booking channel. Thanks again for your feedback!Yours in hospitality-Rob BrehantGeneral Managerrob.brehantmetwestterra.com",Bad
"I used Tripadvisor to review various properties at the Philadelphia airport before booking and the Fairfield Inn was highly rated so we booked. We were astonished to find that the reviews in no way reflect reality. I want to say first of all that the staff were professional, competent and extremely helpful, so this review in no way reflects on them. While the lobby and breakfast room were clean in appearance, the room was a completely different matter. It was shabby and filthy. The sheets and towels were clean but the furniture was sticky, the shower curtain had mold around the edges, and the chair in the room had multiple stains on the seat. The curtains and dust ruffles around the beds were very wrinkled and appeared to have been crumpled in a ball before being used. After noticing these things, I began looking more closely at other aspects of the hotel and noticed that the elevators were quite old and had not been cleaned well either. The hallway carpets appeared dirty and were rippled from stretching - they are obviously old as well and not kept up.This is the second worst hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here or in another Fairfield Inn again. When you can't even sit on the chair in the room because it is so badly stained or touch the tops of the furniture because your fingers will stick to the top, it is pretty bad.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. We take great pride in the service that we provide. Please contact me directly so that I may address your concerns immediately. Rest assured that I will go into every single room today to ensure we continue to reflect the highest cleanliness standards as this is extremely concerning to hear.

"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.

"This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever had the misfortune of checking into. I had come to Orlando to meet with my sister who was flying in from the UK, she and I had not seen each other in 3 years and it was to be a great vacation with each other. Checked in, and 30 minutes later checked out. This hotel had cockroaches, the room we were given was filthy, a visiting prostitute went to the room next door whilst we stood and watched. 3 attempts to gain entry to our room resulted in the handy man coming with master key. And to add insult to injury the dirt and grime was so thick it made me ill. There was one wash cloth, one hand towel, and 2 bath towels. The toilet seat was cracked, and it was supposed to have been a disabled access room. I could not enter the bathroom in my wheelchair. I have reported the hotel both to the Wyndham group, and also to hotel licensing of Orange county Orlando. This place needs condemning.",Bad

Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER.

In my opinion, this could have been done in less time.Loud radio was played in the pool area. When I addressed this, I was not taken seriously. The sliding door to the balcony has no insulation, resulting in that all outside sounds and noise would come in the room.Internet was almost non existent.

"This has been a horrible experience. I was on vacation with my husband and son and this pretty much ruined some of it. At check-in, they had to cancel my existing reservation and start two new ones because my stay was supposed to be paid for with my points (points for 2 nights and pay for 1 night). I would have to check in again after my first two nights and get my key cards reprogrammed. A hassle, but I was willing to do it. They had already put a hold on by debit card for 415.74. They advised us that the hold would be released as per the manager and the money would be credited back. The hold was not released as promised and I had to spend at least an hour at the front desk the next morning trying to get it handled. I also had to call my bank and let the front desk person talk to them in order to get the release done. Our bank took the hold off of the card once they were given an authorization number. I woke up the next morning and found that this hotel had run my debit card for the 415.74 AGAIN. This transaction overdrafted my bank account. I am not even sure yet if the bank is going to charge me an overdraft fee for the hotel's mistake. It was a good thing that I had more money that I could transfer to that account or we would've had issues going to the theme parks or eating meals. My husband went down to the front desk again and had to go through the same hour long session trying to get the problem taken care of. BOTH days of this, we were late getting to the theme parks that our child had been looking forward to. They credited the card back via the bank again. The front desk said that the release of the funds from the day before has never been released as promised. We were assured by front desk personnel that the manager would be in later and that they would have him call us. He did not call us. My husband called the front desk around 5:00 that evening and we were told that the manager said he wouldn't be able to look into anything until the next day. We were flying out the next day. This stay has been the worst I have ever experienced. Very disappointed. We used Hilton Garden Inn because if their good reputation on our last two trips and have spent thousands of dollars staying with them over the last six weeks. We feel that the fact that none of the management had time for us is inexcusable and terrible customer service. We will not do it again.Thank you for sharing your experience about your stay with us.

We were sweating bullets when we finally settled in our hotel room. So after a 8 hour travel than getting to our room in tim buck two it was just a diaster!! Ruined my night for sure!! But the room was okay. The view out the balcony was better than what i thought!! A great view of the pool and the garden. And it was cool that we got to sit out on the deck. We had a room in the old building, so it was a little old unsafe feeling i had the entire stay. The beds were pretty comfortable and made nicely. The little fridge was in a cabinet under the TV, which had a little odor in it and sat on a stained shelf. I actually have never experience a Holiday inn as a motel before, but this room made me feel like i was in a motel. I would not stay here again... not unless it was for a cheaper price than what i paid. If i wanted a motel feel like room.. i would of stayed at Days Inn for half the price!Dear Kristen386, Thank you for your stay with us and leaving feedback.

"Trying to navigate that area of San Diego is very confusing, when it says near I am thinking on the same side not over the freeway down some other side street. I guess I was hoping for Next to Qualcomm instead. Well the room looked like I walked into a bad 70's movie, green and orange decor, very stained carpet and flying insects. The room was in need of some serious updating. They tried to make it look fancy with a bed runner. Luckily the bathroom had been updated, it was safe to take a shower. Too bad it didn't match the rest of the room.",Bad
"We have stayed here 4 nights and its a very basic hotel. It is overly priced even 4th night was free. I dont mind spending some extra money if hotel was worth it. No added amenities, just a small room, leaking sink, and no ocean view. The Sheraton hotel nearby appears to be much nicer. The only thing that I liked was location.",Bad
"Everything was good until we received our bill. We confirmed our reservation on the phone before arrival at 107 a night. At check in, we were told to initial next to our room rate of 107 a night. On departure date we discover there is a charge of 125 for the second night. We asked to see the card we signed when we arrived and it certainly did have 107 next to our initials in the top right hand corner, but over to the left in small print it said 125 for second night. So, here is another scam we must all be aware of, and worse, the person at the desk just turned his head away and said sorry about that. Actually, sorry about that right back to you, because we will never stay at a Homewood Suites again with such deceptive trickery. If you are still thinking of staying here, be aware that one side of the hotel faces Interstate I 4 and is extremely noisy.Hello rtwo dThank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. First and foremost, I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay. However, I'm also glad that you shared your concerns in this review. I have to apologize for the billing issues. Please know that we in no way participate/promote scams or any type of deception to our guests. We all make sure to inform all of our guests about rate changes when we make reservations and also during the check in process. Now, we will all make sure to emphasize this information even more to ensure that no one else has this happen to them. In addition, I hope that you decide to give us another chance in the future. It would be our pleasure to accommodate you and your family again. Take care and hope to see you soon.",Bad
"This used to be my favourite hotel. From now on you're only someone that I used to love. Perhaps they underperformed so dramatically due to a perfect storm of challenging events. It is a holiday weekend, the World Cup is being played in a city full of Immigrants who are all as football (Soccer) mad as I am and to add insult to injury, a major young celebrity is in residence at the hotel. Along with the celebrity has come HORDES of young teenaged girls who have overrun the parking lot, the hotel lobby, the elevator bays AND the hotel BAR! There has been no apparent effort to restrict the access of these obviously non resident children who have been camped out here for days. Hotel guests have been forced to navigate around, over, beside and under them simply to get service. Perhaps due to the nature of the crowd, the usual calm sophistication and unhurried pace of the hotel has vanished and the edges are beginning to show serious wear. There were so many short comings on this trip and far too many opportunities to regret the bill prior to its arrival. A hotel of this purported caliber should never cause one to feel there is a value for money disparity. Your unique selling proposition should be that you are SOOOOO good, I forget how much it costs. While I still hold a particular fondness for the MO- Miami, I have had to draw several uncomplimentary parallels to the much vaunted Ritz Carlton service standards and the Regis' brand of sedateness(stuffiness depending on the POV)and I, for the first time, find the MO outclassed. More's the pity.",Bad
"The HVAC did not work properly leading to both of us having a restless night's sleep. The location was great and the room and layout were also ideal. It is a beautifyl new hotel however, I always sleep through the night even when away from home, and especially after walking over 3 miles at Epcot that day. Was unable to get comfortable, even though I brought my own pillows too. Checked out after one night's stay so would not have another restless night. Expressed our disappointment to the front desk and no alternative was offered, such as moving to another room, or fixing the unit in the existing room. Also, there was no mention of the 100 satsifaction guarantee, so I did pay for the one night.Dear Gary A,I would like to first take this opportunity to apologize for the late reply and to also express my sincerest apologies for not following through on our 100 Hampton guarantee with you during the time of your stay. We ensure all of our guests who come to our property, If you're not satisfied, we don't expect you to pay. I am thoroughly disappointed that we were not able to exhaust another alternative or fix the problem immediately and make your stay more comfortable. I would love to help make this right.

"I'm not sure why this place gets such good reviews because there are other places in Napa that are so much better, see my other reviews.1. They charge your card before you ever arrive.

"The front of the hotel looks very nice and we were actually pleasantly surprised when we pulled in the driveway--if only our room in the back had been so nice. It looks like they invested all of the renovation money in the front of the hotel, NOT in the back, where there are quite a few rooms. Aside from the room looking dingy and feeling gross, there was a crack between the doorjam and the actual door that you could peek through into the room if you leaned up to the crack--it was wide enough that the brochures the local eateries were sliding into the door went all the way in easily! The broken mini-fridge was actually propped up with the Bible. There was no way I was going to let my kids stay in this motel, we checked out and went to the Days Inn Airport--which was 5 cheaper a night, and although it was no palace, at least we felt safe and had a clean place to stay!

"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights, arriving on Tuesday 7 October and departing Thursday 9th. I was very disappointed.My reservation for this stay was confirmed in January 2014. It was prepaid, and the charge was posted to my credit card account on 10 January last. I selected the hotel partly for its location, partly because it offered the facilities and amenities I sought, and partly because of good reviews on TripAdvisor.When we arrived at the hotel on 7 October, the lady on the front counter told me the MasterCard I presented was declined, and requested another card. Since I knew there was nothing wrong with my card or account, I stood my ground. Reluctantly she tried again, and succeeded. But that was clearly not her first choice.I told her the reservation was prepaid, which she denied. She said it would be charged to my card. After I got settled in my room I went online and downloaded a copy of my credit card statement for the month of January (showing the charge for this stay), which I showed the front desk lady. Reluctantly she agreed and asked pointedly It has not been charged to your account here, has itOne of the amenities that drove my choice of this hotel was free parking, as advertised on the hotels website. What it does not say is that there are only 40 or 41 spaces, given out on a first come first served basis. When we arrived they had all been given out. Because we were staying two nights I was permitted to park on the street in front of the hotel, rather than off-site (the other option). Neither of those options fits what I understand when a hotel advertises free parking. (I was given access to the hotel's parking area for our second night.)When we reached our room we were very disappointed at its size. There was neither room nor a stand to open two suitcases one case occupied the armchair, leaving only the desk chair for seating. This does not conform with what I expect from a Best Western, let alone a Best Western Plus hotel. And at 161 per night I consider it over-priced, though most hotels of this standard in New Orleans seem to charge around this figure.On both mornings we were at the hotel, when I stepped into the bath to shower there appeared black grime on the bath from my feet this came from the carpet. I complained the first morning and asked that the floor be vacuumed, but the problem was still there the second morning. I consider that the carpet in that room requires a shampoo.Finally, on both mornings when we came to breakfast the four tables provided were all fully used. On the first morning we had our breakfast in the Business Centre on the second morning we waited until other guests left.On the morning of our departure there appeared under the door a statement which, in the light of the initial denial that the reservation was prepaid, could have meant that the hotel had charged the stay to my credit card on the day of my arrival. The lady at the front desk on departure morning clarified that, though I must say bringing a January payment into the hotels account on 7 October seems a strange way to keep books. But the total of this statement exceeded my prepayment by 4.92, and appeared to say this amount was charged to my card on departure. I hope and expect that no attempt is made to recover this amount. A prepaid room is fully prepaid if the hotels charges change between when the stay is prepaid and when the guests arrive, that is the hotels risk. After all, they had my money for nine months. It is not a charge that can legitimately be passed on to the customer.Bruxin,I appreciate you taking time to let us know about the issues you had with the hotel. I am very sorry about the confusion with the prepayment. We just switched out front desk system, and they have been working on it for about a week and a half! The system is not playing well with out credit card swipers causing declines, so we have new ones on order. I have refunded the 4.92 to your credit card. The city implemented a tourism assessment in April causing the difference in your bill. I do heartily apologize for the disappointment in our hotelMelissa AlbertGeneral Managermalbertstcharlesinn.net",Bad
"When my friends and I looked for overnight stays in New Orleans during this years's Jazz festival we were in desperate need for accomodation as we decided to go on the trip last minute. When we explained the management that we needed to stay on a budget as low as possible, preferring to share one room instead of booking two, they deliberately misunderstood us, charging us the room rate for two instead of one. We immediatly realized the mistake and asked to rectify it. The management was then totally unhelpful, refused to rectify and called the police. The police sided with the management, which should not even have been an issue at all right from the start. Any serious and well-led hotel should allow the customers to rectify a booking, particularly since we hadn't even entered the rooms. Do not stay there if you are looking for an honest management and good service!!",Bad

"My family are Disney annual passholders so we wanted to drive up for an overnight and get an extra evening in. We decided to stay here because some of the other hotels we normally stay at were booked. I read the reviews re: the parking, so I was prepared. Also ready the reviews re: the bad coffee...nothing still prepared me for the horrible stuff they serve. No hot water for tea either.The room just had a general feel of being old and tired. My eight year old grandson panicked when he went to take a shower. He felt as if he was using towels someone else had used.What was the true kicker was when we left. My daughter-in-law left her makeup bag in the room.When we had left a different Anaheim hotel a few months before, they called immediately because I had left my sunglasses there.No one called her.She arrived home and since we arrived late, didn't notice until she was getting ready for work the next day.She called the hotel. At first they said it wasn't there, then changed their minds and said it was.When the bag arrived a few days later - 1/2 of her makeup was missing! (Naturally, the more expensive makeup.)She called the hotel and asked to speak to the manager. He wasn't available. She asked when. They said he would arrive in the late afternoon and he would call her.No call.She called back. Was told she had just missed the manager and the manager wouldn't be until Monday.She called Monday am. The manager wasn't in. She should call back.She wasn't able to talk to manager until Tuesday -- about 4 days AFTER her first call.The manager denied anything was missing. no comments such as: I'm so sorry...I'll look into it.

"They literally could not pay me to stay here again.Rewind 24 hours ago...check in seems fine. The place has a musty smell and everything is extremely run down - but okay, fine, its one night. Go to an elevator behind the diner. The elevator is barely in service. There is a blinking neon sign that reminds you that this is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The walls and carpets are drab/dark and the lighting is dim.First room we go in, okay seems fine, upon further inspection a GIGANTIC hole in the wall. Called the front desk and they could not have seemed more apathetic. No, OMG we are so sorry! Instead there was okay we will change it... fine....Second room, smells like ciggarettes but okay. Another smaller hole in the wall, but everything else seems okay. We go out, come back around 1 get ready for bed and lie down. Fiance and I cannot sleep with out noise so we turned on the AC - only heat came out, so we tried to sleep without it. Think again! This is where our nightmare began - you will hear every noise in atlantic city. From a bum sneezing, to some frat kids screaming, to some bachelorettes flirting with the frat guys I think I heard it all. I ended up going in the hall way and screaming some profane things at them.Cut to 5 am..this is still occuring. In fact, one of the frat guys smashed into our door with his entire body and screamed oh S*it I finally gave in and went to the front desk and asked them if they could do something - they sent two security guards (who to their credit were very nice) but could not do much to help. NEedless to say, we checked out immediately. The manager could not do much but gave us a credit. I Will be disputing the charge on my credit card. My favorite part - as we were walking out, blood was smeared all over the wall! Guessing it was one of the idiots that decided 5 am was a good time for a hallway wrestling match.IF you are thinking about staying here - think again! It is dirty, disgusting, run down and nothing like the pictures on the website. I actually think the fact that they even have those pictures on the website has to be illegal/unethical.",Bad

To top that off. This shouldve been something they credited me back asap, i shouldnt still be waiting for the money in my account days and days later, i dont appreciate how slow its taking the hotel to decide to refund me and get back to me, this made me negative in my account and accumulated bank fees.

"We had booked this hotel for two nights after our cruise in January . Two months before we were to arrive our plane home was moved to an exceptionally early time. We decided we had to stay at an airport hotel in order to make our plane, since we had to be at the airport by 4:30AM. I called to cancel the one night. Imagine my surprise when Hyatt raised the room rate for the remaining night 165. I questioned the reasoning and was told that even though we had until 24 hours before to cancel they treated the remaining night as a new reservation.

"Stayed at the JW Marriott several times now as it is in a very convenient location and close to Houston's, however I think it is a dump the more I stay. This last time, the price increases from one amount to about a 100.00 more in 2 hours when I went back to book. Then I get a room with a shower/tub combo that I specifically said, I don't want. My morning shower was a nightmare to say the least. The water only trickled out of the faucet as the handle was off in my hand. Seriously I could not even shampoo my hair. I was livid. Pictures attached as when I say trickled I mean that may be an exaggeration as it was only basically dripping. The rooms are really a dump. Last time the air did not work and the filter looked to be about 10 years old. This room had air that worked so well it sounded like someone was in the duct work banging to get out, seriously I turned the air off to get some sleep. The decor is very modern and updated and truly looks nice. I just expect the room to be comfortable in a JW not falling apart. Very unhappy with this hotel. Moved over to the AC from now on.Thank you for your recent visit. I am sorry you were disappointed in your stay and the with housekeeping issues you described. Rest assured that I have followed up with our staff for immediate correction. I am not sure what may have happened with the rate increase you mentioned.

"A transient welfare hotel without amenities of any kind, but once a week, non-scrub housekeeping. No elevators despite 5 floors, no handicapped access, despite ADA laws. A non-responsive corporate office for this multi state, chain of single rooms rented by the week is less than 5 miles away, at Paces Ferry Rd., so there's no excuse. They don't return calls or emails.Most employees here are pleasant, but as we all know, one incompetent individual can bring down a hard earned reputation. Reservations were not recorded by the woman, and repair orders went weeks unacknowledged, including toilet overflowing issues, electrical hazards of broken sockets and short circuiting of outlets and kitchen burners. Thankfully, we rarely cooked. Good restaurants chains in the area are a plus. No air conditioning in the room or repair effort in six months. Must be owned by a billionaire I'd suppose, since rooms lay vacant and Ms. Murphy has no problem sassing the guests or playing the slumlord.Holes in the walls, the room was infested with bed and other bugs, mice. A dirtier room I had never seen before. A few hired hands, paint, steamer, laundry bug spray clean up a place well, if you need a good location, at a cheap price, which is what we did. Your own stuff, can make it comfortable for an extended stay. Security personnel, Miss Melanie and manager are excellent, polite, reputable and we never had any valuables go missing during a year using this Piedmont Circle facility.",Bad

"Rooms where not ready upon arrival waiting two hours for them and we had a nb baby. Price is expensive for a mediocre place. Had breakfast there food was not hot more warm but we did have a nice staff at breakfast.I am very sorry your room was not ready when you arrived, especially with a new born baby. I know that was probably challenging for you and your family. We make every effort to have rooms cleaned as soon as possible for our arriving guests. Thank you for your feedback and I hope you will give us another opportunity in the future.",Bad

"Room was filthy. Staff was mediocre. Stained sheets, used medicine cups in drawer, filters full of dust and leaky shower. Place is a dump and not worth the price. Would not recommend to anyone, especially if you are traveling with kids. Dear Bobby,Thank you for your feedback. We take our guest comments very seriously and always strive to provide comfortable and friendly accommodations. Were sorry we fell below your expectation regarding cleanliness, carpet condition, bathroom amenities and bathroom cleanliness which was unacceptable. We will address these concerns. I assure you that the feedback of our hotel will be reviewed and most certainly forwarded to the appropriate departments. We take the confidence our guests place in us very seriously and work diligently to rectify any unsatisfactory experiences. We hope you give us a chance in the future to show you how great our hotel is.Sincerely,",Bad
"The hotel was under major construction - there is no front desk/lobby area. This was not apparent when booking the room. The front door was closed and there were work crews in the makeshift lobby area during our entire stay. The free breakfast is a single piece of bread and a small glass of orange juice. There is no free breakfast. The hotel is extremely overpriced. The hotel is within decent walking distance of the New Orleans sights. The customer service is non-existent. I booked this hotel through hotels.com after calling to confirm that I could use a third party site and still get a Cruise and Stay discount on cruise terminal parking. The hotel CONFIRMED that I could do this. They also CONFIRMED this when I arrived at check-in. At check out they DENIED that I could have discounted cruise parking and the front desk employee refused to contact a manager or customer service for me. Customer service did not answer my call after 30 minutes.Dear E G,I am terribly sorry to read about the service that you experienced in May of 2016. We are no longer under any construction and I can assure you that this is not typical service for our hotel- especially now. I apologize that you were misinformed about our cruise parking rate as that does need to be booked directly in order to ensure the discount. I am not sure who you are referencing in regards to customer service but there is no excuse for the experience that you had. We do offer a complimentary croissant along with your choice of coffee, a variety of teas or orange juice delivered right to your room. It is our intention for this to be a nice treat before you head out to explore our beautiful city for the day. If you find yourself in New Orleans again, I do hope you stop by to see the difference a year can make. Best,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",Bad
We booked a room at this hotel but didn't stay the night. We arrived and checked in and went to our room to find an extremely dirty bathtub and the vent hanging from the ceiling. We complained to the front desk girl who told us that that was common on the first floor because construction workers use those rooms and... More,Bad
"Careful when you book this place, especially if you book via a third party! We booked and supposedly paid for the hotel when we booked it, yet we had money taken when we checked out. I have since been informed by the company that I booked it through that this is a non refundable hotel and therefore we had already paid! so we now have to claim a refund from Hampton Inn for charging us twice! Not a comfortable nights sleep, pillows were terrible, WIFI was in and out, staff were unhelpful and so on. Simple sum up here, stay somewhere else!Thank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and were very sorry for negative experience at our hotel. If you would like to discuss these issues in more detail, please contact us at the information below.

"This motel was not that clean. Long, black hair in tub. Breakfast was horrible, no one around stocking syrup and such was empty and nothing seemed stocked at 8 a.m, dirty tables. Couldn't even eat there, we left and went down road to have breakfast. On the positive side, it was quiet and shower had good water pressure.",Bad
"This is a review of the customer service that I experienced at the Hilton. You would certainly expect better customer service from a 4-star hotel. After booking, I immediately reviewed the information and noticed the date was incorrect. So I called them to make the necessary correction. Apparently, it routed to a different date because the preselected date was not available (that's what the agent told me). They would not give me a refund, allow me to change my date, or even a credit to be applied to future reservations (not even a partial credit!). Now I'm stuck with a reservation that I can't even use. Thus, this review will only be limited to the customer service as I won't be able to use the reservation to enjoy the room. After this experience, I'm boycotting the Hilton. It's unfortunate as I always choose the Hilton above other hotels. No longer a fan!We thank you for submitting a guest survey. It is very unfortunate that you booked a non-refundable/non-modifiable reservation online. This review, while being pointed at our hotel as the one providing poor service, highlights the drawback with booking these type of reservations online. Hilton urges guests to book reservations through our websites. While these other internet booking sites offer a significant discount, the reservations mostly are not guaranteed a specific room type (king or double) and, most importantly, the reservations are not modifiable and cannot be canceled. This is clearly stated through the website that you booked on. Please use Hilton.com to book your stay. With our reservations, we have the flexibility to assist you when reservations need to be modified.",Bad
"One night staff theaten to call police and lock the doors as one our members (coach was in the sitting area with a player). He was rude and could of spoke to the guests in a polite manner before giving the rude ultimatum as there was a loud party not from our group making noise the night before. Rooms has a old smell and I had to spray the pillows and sheets with frebreeze. Housekeeping missed cleaning our room one day as they said we refused cleaning, I asked all the guest in the room and they said this never happened. Also housekeeping was performed very late in many of our groups rooms. Perhaps more cleaning staff is needed during the busy Albion cup weekend. The internet needs faster speed, perhaps this is the way Hampton makes money if guest are frustrated with the complimentary internet.Rooms should have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds as they are very small for 4 adults. I used the coffee maker/fridge/microwave, happy they were available but they could use upgrading.The pool was cool and there was no hot tub. It would also be benificial to have laundry on site- even if we have to pay for it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to future guest on TripadvisorThank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and we sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience.

"We have stayed at a Hampton Inn several times because we are family of 5 and it is accommodating. Since the rate is usually between 125 and 200 you get what you pay for.

"I didn't stay here. the place looks decent from the outside, but the inside....well, I never got that far. first, I entered the front desk area to have 2 men behind the desk. One just standing there, the other answering the phone...over and over the phone rang. he wasn't very plesant to the callers either. and after getting off the phone, he would mock and make fun of them. from the TV not working to the faucett leaking to the front door lock not working. his answer seemed to be maintenance isn't here, I can't do anything. really after about 10 mi9nutes, he got to me. I asked for any room, I'm not picky. he said sure we have one for ya...then I mentioned the corporate card I travel for business on and was told, he would see if he had a room.(card is for discounted rates like AAA) I then mentioned that I had a rewards number I wished to use and he handed me back the rewards card and said that the rewards points would not be awarded on discounted rates. (I have received rewards points on EVERY hotel I checked into with this same card including BW plus, Holiday inn, comfort/quality...every one! ) he then answered the phone again and interupted our conversation without even saying excuse me or anything...and after a few minutes of being ignored I left and told them i would find another hotel that was friendlier.I went a little farther toward the jobsite and got a room at another Best Western in Santee...where they are friendly and I really liked the empolyees and the location. (and I got the reward points like I have at all other hotels.)these guys were jerks, and I would rather sleep in my car than stay here. I will never stop here again.",Bad
"Hotel stay was ruined 1) the pool closed on the 2nd day due to child's toilet accident. Hotel staff then shocked the pool, and opened it several hours later. However, 2) no warning sign was put out to inform guests that shocked indoor pools are dangerous for people with respiratory problems. Had to end stay at Hotel early due to sudden severe respiratory problems that developed at the pool on 2nd day. My Dr. later informed me that the chemicals in the air from the shocked pool caused my respiratory problems. Hotel also put, unknown 115 charge on our CC after we left, even though we used our Wyndam Rewards points. Manager of hotel failed to respond to written complaints left at the desk. General Manager failed to return several phone calls in a timely manner, and finally told us that Wyndham did not do anything wrong It was a CYA response. Our vacation was ruined. I had to have 7 Rxs filled + Emergency visit to my Dr. who felt I might need to go to the ER. No cleaning staff ever came to our room to clean it.Hello dalef565,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel, the pool was in working condition. The incident that happened we did have to take the correct protocol by shocking the pool to insure that no one is harmed by the chemical or the bile. We did check all pool levels and tested the water before allowing anyone in the pool. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff to ensure that we change the look of our hotel. We do care as a staff about every situation that goes on at our hotel good or bad. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for any inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call.

"I travel on business nationwide constantly, and I'm gold level for most chains: now I know why I don't stay at Sheratons often. Their location on Bourbon Street is bad enough. It took my 1/2 to go one block due to all the drunk revelers walking in the street, and the GPS didn't know what to do. By the time I got to the front desk, I was tired to the point of tears, and the front desk staff were cold, unfriendly and rude. As it turns out the Starwood computer system messed up and showed me as arriving the next night. Despite seeing a well dressed, exhausted middle aged woman asking for help, the front desk lady just looked at me and said, loudly, You're here on the wrong night!looking at me as though I were an idiot. She made NO effort to find me room, NOR did she even offer to call another hotel to get me a room, even though it was almost midnight, for my plane had been delayed three hours!!! I started crying (!) and went back out to get my car from the valet,. I have NEVER been treated so poorly by a hotel: ever! I had to sit in my car with my cell phone charging, calling hotels for a room. Stay away from this property! I called the next day trying to get the manager, and was put on terminal hold, so I hung up.Dear TripGypsi, We are very disheartened to hear of your disappointing experience at our hotel as it is very important to us to make our guests feel welcomed.

"My husband and I usually stay 3 or more times a year at this hotel when we go in to Midtown to see a play at the Woodruff Arts Center Complex. The location is excellent - within easy walking distance to do this and also a couple of acceptable restaurants nearby.We went last week and on a Tuesday night, I made the reservation 2 hours prior using my Marriott Rewards Elite Member points. When we arrived we were told they were starting a refurbishment of the hotel so the water was off until about 6:30. Why not mention this when I was making the reservationSo no nice hot shower and chance to spruce up and change clothes before going out to make the theater curtain. So we decided o.k. we will go to plan B - no play we will go out to eat and then just watch a movie in the room - with no kids around- what a treat - something without talking animals! But wait - the movie channels were not working on the TV- so no movie or play! To be fair the front desk offered to send someone to try and fix the problem - but we were already in our pajamas and I just did not feel like getting redressed for a stranger to come attempt to fix the issue. We just went to sleep. The condition of our queen suite should have been embarrassing to the Marriott corporation. The easy chair in the room looked worse than a thrift store find - it would have been better to take it out of the room than leave something in that condition in the room. The ceiling/walls in the bathroom had been recently spackled/repaired which is fine - except the cleaning staff did not clean up the dust from this repair.The staff were all wonderful. The young lady at the front desk was polite and tried her best to be helpful. The women at the breakfast buffet in the morning was so friendly and went and got me a bottle of water from downstairs when I ask if there was water available (a glass of tap water would have been fine). The breakfast has good selections for a free hotel breakfast.Valet parking has gone up to 28 - ouch!I am very disappointed that because of the remodeling and the other maintenance glitches our child free romantic night on the town turned in to a less than stellar evening. What a waste of my rewards points.",Bad

"Honestly should have known better than to try a second stay. At least this time, the wifi eventually worked, but the desk clerk didn't even know that the room I was given didn't have a microwave / working refrigerator like my reservation said it would. At least there was a great fast mex restaurant within walking distance. When I returned, there were two squad cars and police at the room above me, sidestepping the dog feces in the parking lot, I got into my room took a hot shower, took note of the cigarette burns in the bathroom of the non-smoking room, and hit the clean sheets. Breakfast room was clean, food ok, big sign that said no taking food to rooms. -shrug- another hot shower and I got out of there. Won't go back.",Bad
"The hotel is well located for tourist attractions and check-in was easy. Getting maid service of any kind was next to impossible. No one would take responsibility of any kind. I called corporate and they agreed and called the hotel. Finally a general manager spoke with me and guaranteed my room would be cleaned between 9 am and 2 pm the next day when I was to attend a wedding. It didn't happen. Bathroom trash really does need to be disposed of daily. Both elevators broke during our stay and we never saw a repair person. So 6 flights of stairs every time. What was to have been a joyous occasion turned in to a very bad experience.Dear TravelingJeffry,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the Hyatt house Seattle. I am sorry that your stay did not go as planned and that your room was not serviced and the elevators were down for maintenance. I can see how this would be create a very bad experience or you while you were in town for a wedding. Also that I did not get to speak with you in person while you were staying with us.

"Ok.. before I start the review - Can I just say that I always stay at budget hotels and never really have any issues.The continental plaza is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!",Bad

"I'll start with the good, very near Sea World and easy drive to Disney. Delicious breakfast, fun pool, and overall kind employees. But one major negative problem was cigarette smell. Our room was almost uninhabitable due to the smoke smell, it hit you in the hallway as you open the door! It was so strong everyone got a headache, so we avoided staying in the room as much as possible. Supposedly non-smoking hotel but this room didn't get the message. We told the staff and reminded them everyday (stayed three nights), and they never were able to move us to another room. And I left my number for the manager and attempted to meet with him multiple times, but he never called or was available. So they made absolutely zero amends for the situation, not even a real apology. Too bad, because this place should be a great stay, but they shouldn't claim to be smoke free and certainly could be more professional in at least calling me back when there is a problem. So I won't be staying there again and would not recommend it after my experience. Good Morning Sir,I would like to start of by apologizing sincerely about smoke smell you had to endure during the duration of your stay. Our goal is to always make sure our guest leave here satisfied, and unfortunately we failed at meeting that promise for you. We are non-smoking hotel for this very reason, I would like to talk to you more about your stay, please, if you could please give me a call here at the hotel 407-239-4540 EXT 134, I would love to talk to you about this.

"The hotel itself is fine but two times the housekeeping staff left our door open so when we came back after long days out we found the room wide open. The safe was not accessible so our passports and valuables were left unsecured.

We spent the weekend Of September 17-19th. The location was great and the hotel beautiful. I was disappointed in the gentleman behind the counter who treated my family and others in our party like we weren't worthy of staying there. We were well dressed and happen to all be very educated with good jobs and I felt throughout the entire check in process that we were being treated like we didn't belong.

When my family and I took a shuttle back from Disney we were dropped off 4 minutes away in the middle of the road while it was pouring and when we asked the bus driver he told us to f**k off his bus. No apology or anything. I was told by staff that I would receive some type of compensation (points, etc) however at the end of my stay I was told I will be receiving nothing. I honestly just wanted at least an apology for what my family had to go through that day and if Hilton is nice enough something else.

"I'll start off by letting you all know that when travelling in the UK we usually stay in cheap hotels (Travelodge, Premier Inn etc) but this hotel is the pits.

"Upon arrival the lady acted like it was an inconvenience to get up from the desk in the back and wait on my at the counter. She laid the keys on the counter while working and I noticed it said 222. I asked if that was second floor and she said yes. I told her I had requested a first floor when making the reservation two weeks earlier and she stated they didn't have any rooms on ground floor available very matter of fact. She continues with check in, never mentioned breakfast like they always have in the past. We unload and walk the small hike to the room. At 3:10 a.m. my husband jumps and startles me awake to find a rather large roach crawling on his face.He slaps the roach to the floor and chases it and gets rid of it. He calls the front desk to let them know what has happened and the man that answers the phone stated he would have maintenance take care of it the following morning. We then stay awake the rest of the night until time to leave for the hospital. He couldn't sleep thinking another roach was around there. I checked out the next morning and asked for the number to the corporate office and they never asked what was wrong, just told me they were owned by choice hotels. We have stayed at this hotel many times when it was Holiday Inn Express through my husbands illness we were in Atlanta a good bit off and on and never had a complaint but this was a very miserable night and we don't plan to stay at this hotel again. They could have at least acted like they cared about what was going on. This stay was on 7-17-2012.",Bad

"You get what you pay for, but don't expect an AARP discount. Found and booked this location through the membership website but was told on arrival that they don't honor AARP, even though the AARP discount sticker is located on the lobby door, and, You already received our discounted rate. Location is okay and within walking distance of downtown, but don't do this alone at night. Found hairs of different types and texture in the bed and bath tub and, when issue taken to reception, was treated very rudely by clerk. Replacement sheets were also riddled with hair, which made for a very uncomfortable night's rest. No microwave, coffee pot, refrigerator, etc. in third-floor room, and no vending machine on the floor. Ice machine made horrible racket all night. Only coffee available is located in the lobby and comes in a two-swallow-sized cup. If you're looking for cheap rates, be aware of what you'll get here. Otherwise, go elsewhere and either rent a car or use car service. Like me, I'm sure you work too hard for your money to receive this type of treatment. Would not recommend if they paid me.",Bad
"Situated right on the Chinatown gates, Astoria is perfectly located. A few blocks from the muni the cable cars, bart within 1 block but the hotel itself is terrible but it's very cheap.

"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Bad
"Not recommended. Pulled in here after a lovely drive up from LA. We were all in great spirits until we were checked in. Without going into too much detail the girl at reception was short, rude and unhelpful. After going into our smelly rooms I literally walked back out, cancelled our booking via a website booking dot com (burning 400 for that nights accommodation), loaded up the car and drove around at 6-7pm at night on a Friday - till I found another place for our 3 night visit, which was walking distance to Fishermans Wharf. The other place was actually pretty average but got a great deal and recouped the 400 on room rates, way closer to the Wharf/Lombard/Girardelli's area.

This hotel is just ok. The rooms are decent but nothing more. The pool is small but I guess adaquate for kids. The walls are paper thin and we were awake every night by people walking in the room above. If you want quiet choose a room on the 3rd floor and away from the pool. The complimentary breakfast is just ok also. I love my breakfast and this was not that good at all. Eggs and sausages were not edible. At least there was cereal and milk. The location is good as there are several big shopping malls around. The zoo and sea world are close also. Ralph's grocery store is also not far. You do need a car in san diego though.,Bad

"I used Tripadvisor to review various properties at the Philadelphia airport before booking and the Fairfield Inn was highly rated so we booked. We were astonished to find that the reviews in no way reflect reality. I want to say first of all that the staff were professional, competent and extremely helpful, so this review in no way reflects on them. While the lobby and breakfast room were clean in appearance, the room was a completely different matter. It was shabby and filthy. The sheets and towels were clean but the furniture was sticky, the shower curtain had mold around the edges, and the chair in the room had multiple stains on the seat. The curtains and dust ruffles around the beds were very wrinkled and appeared to have been crumpled in a ball before being used. After noticing these things, I began looking more closely at other aspects of the hotel and noticed that the elevators were quite old and had not been cleaned well either. The hallway carpets appeared dirty and were rippled from stretching - they are obviously old as well and not kept up.This is the second worst hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here or in another Fairfield Inn again. When you can't even sit on the chair in the room because it is so badly stained or touch the tops of the furniture because your fingers will stick to the top, it is pretty bad.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. We take great pride in the service that we provide. Please contact me directly so that I may address your concerns immediately. Rest assured that I will go into every single room today to ensure we continue to reflect the highest cleanliness standards as this is extremely concerning to hear.

"The most miserable dump I've ever had the misfortune to step into in my entire life. Let me tell you why. Spoiler: It ends with this being a mold dump. The paint on the door is peeling. Door opens and we're slammed with a wave of moldy smell that's mean as hell and thick as grass. We're dead tired and we assume that maybe we just need to run the AC or maybe we just need to leave the door open for a bit. (The door needs to be shoved closed by the way.) The light in the bathroom buzzes like a chain saw and a quick shower ends with stained towels. Or maybe they were just dirty. Early wake up the next day and we come back to the same rancid smell. I investigate and realize there is clear water damage everywhere!!! Bu the door, in the bathroom, all over the ceiling. Thrown in damaged furniture and a sink that's falling apart and you really have an A+ dump. All this on top of a real health hazard. We checked out and went somewhere else at like 11 PM.",Bad
"I have been a Hilton Honors member since the inception of the program. Arrived at the hotel with family, and a man checked us in for a room, confirming the reservation (had conf. ). Then Veronica Bonilla, asst. GM, came to the desk and said my reservation was cancelled per my bank. When I questioned that, she became unpleasant. She stated the hotel had called me 3 times (no record of calls on my cell phone). I called my bank, it seems the hotel had imputed my expiration date incorrectly. I had confirmation for a suite but was given a different class of room with a slight decrease of cost (12.38). However, we waited for over an hour (with a toddler) for another room, even though my original room (suite) was still available.The next morning we went for breakfast about 9:50 am but part of the food was already taken away. Earlier than the 10 am noted time. We had to eat out at a restaurant. I have traveled to many Hilton's for business and pleasure and this by far had the worst customer service, especially follow-up by a manager (with attitude) and untruths that I had been called. I was also told that the GM would call me on Monday, again no call. If you are in the Seaworld vicinity, stay at another property. With our annual passes, I know I will next time. Additionally, when I was at the desk, another customer was also complaining about misinformation they had received by a clerk about the shuttle. When I checked out, the clerk gave me my receipt and then said, oh did I give you the wrong persons receipt. After I showed it to her, she said, no, that is yours!",Bad
"I have seen this before in other hotel brands but shocked that the JW Marriott has resorted to HVAC manipulation to save a buck. You know where you turn the thermostat to 65 at night and the air blows at 70 (if you're lucky). Actually in our case it was turned down to 60 because we overrode the thermostat and called maintenance when this didn't work and the air still couldn't have been any cooler than 70. The thing about it is that the air was working because the room would cool off in the daytime. Apparently they're overriding the air temp from a master switch and putting a cap on how cool it will be at night. I'm sure this is to conserve electricity but why can't they do this in the daytime when people aren't in their rooms or trying to sleep instead of at night when people actually care about the temperature! Just be aware if you like your room temp below 70 you probably won't be happy here.Dear WullaB86,Thank you for choosing us for your visit.

"I went to stay at this hotel and ordered a jacuzzi suite which is suppose to be one of the nicest of their rooms. I go in the rook is huge. It looks nice but as the day goes on I kill at least 8 stink bugs, the bugs that emit a disgusting smell when killed. I use the jacuzzi tub and one of the jets do not work some of the towles have this yellow residue on it and the tub wasnt completely clean. I check out today to find out they charged me 150 dollars because I left some tobacco in the trash which they institute as smoking. I make my own cigarettes so sometimes I do not use all of the tobacco but if I wouldve known I would be charged 150 dollars for leaving tobacco around I would have never went to this hotel. I did not smoke in the room at all and i know it smells nothing like smoke so I do not understand what constitutes the charge of 150 dollars. The general manager was not there so I have to wait until Monday.Our entire hotel is non-smoking. We do charge one hundred and fifty dollars when a guest smokes in the room.

"Room needed some work, or a deep cleaning. It smelled like someone tried to cover a moldy smell with air freshener that smelled like cologne. Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dirty on one of the beds, as if someone had walked across it with shoes on. The room had a mini fridge but it was turned down to 1 so I had to turn it on to store my food items. I was given room 115, which unfortunately for me was right near the breakfast area so as soon as breakfast was available I was woken up by everyone walking by and holding loud conversations. Then at 7:45am, what I can only assume was a dance troop staying there, started practicing their routines in the middle of the parking lot while blasting their music and yelling. At 9am when I went to check out they were still going strong and oblivious to anyone trying to navigate the lot. When I was trying to back up, one of them walked up behind my vehicle and I had to ask them to move. Then after pulling out of my spot and attempting to leave, a few of them almost walked right in front of me because they were not paying attention. I find it extremely RUDE that they assumed everyone would be wide awake and want to listen to this.

It's so ridiculous I feel odd even writing this.

I called the front desk and he stated he tried to call the cell and the room and talked to someone(not me) that said they didn't want the pizza. I told him we were waiting for the pizza and of course we would of answered any call to the room. His response was are you calling me a liar. I called your room and you didn't answer!! I've never dealt with any front desk staff at any hotel I've ever stayed at that was so blatantly obtuse, defensive, and mean. Maybe he was having a bad day but it's borderline childish. He told me the pizza is here come and get it. I did and it was ice cold just sitting there and he was super rude during the exchange. Horrible service.The hotel itself is nice and check in was good.

Also, thank you for pointing out the items that were not working properly while you were here. As you experienced, we have no problem fixing things when we are made aware and making them right. One item that did not get fixed until you were gone was the sugar ants, but I want to let you know that too has been resolved the day you checked-out we had an exterminator come in and treat the room, and then revisit it a week later.I am sorry this was not a memorable trip for the right reasons, but I appreciate your kind words about the team. I hope to have the opportunity to serve you as a guest again.Sincerely,Patrick D.General Manager",Bad
The pool and hot tub was filthy. Tried to call front desk and was unable to reach anyone about it.I apologize your stay with us was not a pleasant one.

"In the last few months, I've stayed at three different Hilton properties for work... and the Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Bernardo, CA is a disappointment. Less well cared for than their sister brand Hampton Inn. And as a HiltonHonors member, they refused to give me a free bottle of water after the check-in for my 8 day stay. Wifi is sketchy. Parking and restaurant is substandard. Stay at a corporate rate at the nearby Rancho Bernardo Inn. So much more worth it!Also, light on mirror in bathroom has been out for a day and I just called down and the maintenance person on duty doesn't have access to the lightbulbs.I am very sorry that you did not have a good experience with us. I do appreciate your feedback and I will ensure I personally follow up to ensure we correct these issues. We truly appreciate your loyalty to the brand and are very disappointed that we fell short of your expectations. Please know that we take your feedback seriously and will improve. We hope that you will consider trying us again on a future stay.",Bad
"The room has additional room fee charged which should be included in the price for wifi ect and the wifi consitantly drops out. The noise at night from other venues such as empty bottles being emptied into bins occurs every night and the room above had water dripping onto our window from the a/c unit which kept us awake. It's a old hotel with a lick of paint on it and also had construction work being carried out during the day the staff are friendly but I won't be returning.Thank you for the feedback. We are pleased to hear that you found our staff to be friendly. I apologize however if the rest of your stay was less than excellent. We do charge a facility fee that includes free Wifi as well as other items. I am sorry you were having difficulties connecting, we do have 24 hour staff available at the front desk to assist our guests with things like this. We strive for all guests to have a 5 star stay and again we apologize this was not the case.",Bad

"First, make sure you are booking the hotel you want. There is another Comfort Inn (Zoo / SeaWorld area) nearby and it has a better rating than this one. At this one we reserved a kid's suite, however, they do not seem to have a room as pictured on the website w/kid's bunkbed. So you buy a room and get another one that is dirty and smells bad. The staff at the reception is courteous, but the cleaning people seem to make a special effort to make you feel uncomfortable.",Bad

"I spent two nights here on what was a VERY busy weekend, due, I imagine, to any number of colleges ending their spring semesters. The hotel was jammed with visitors and because I arrived late in the day, I got what must have been the last room, even though I had had a reservation for several weeks. I was put in a handicap-access room on the first floor, which was spacious and seemed quiet due to its location at the end of the hall. However, at 7:45 am the construction crew started working in the room directly over my head and I was awakened by the sound of someone scraping the floor above my bed. So much for sleeping in for a late work day ahead...I complained by phone to the front desk and they apologized and promised to move me for the second night of my stay. Two hours later I checked in at the desk to see if I could move before I had to leave for work, but was told that the hotel was again booked solid and they would see what could be done. At that point, I got angry and mentioned that I had requested the change hours before, I am a Hilton Honors member, and anything else that I could think of that would persuade the agent to make the change. She did point out that the renovation work was posted on their website, and there was a printed apology in the lobby, neither of which made me any less sleepy...She finally found a room on the third floor, which was above the floor being worked on, and I moved. It was a nicer room. HOWEVER, bright and early the next morning (Sunday) the sounds of a power nailer wafted up through the vent in the bathroom. Luckily, I had to be at work early that day anyway, so I was already up. If you are booked here, try to get as far from any renovation construction as possible. Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are very sorry that you werent happy with your guestroom during your recent trip. We try to accommodate all reservations but occasionally we cant meet every room request. Your feedback is important us. Were very sorry for the noise issue you encountered in the morning. Your comfort is our number one concern, and we appreciate that you brought this to our attention. Your review will help us correct similar issues in the future. I would like to hear more details on your stay. If possible you can contact me at Jessica.Jones2hilton.com. Our renovations are now completed and we hope that the next time youre in the area, youll consider staying with us again.Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport!",Bad
"The good -- the hotel was nice, relatively new and had an indoor drop off lane, so getting in during inclement weather would be easy. The room was normal sized for this type of hotel, but typical HGI spartan, no in room safe, just basic furnishing. The ceilings were high, which gave the room a roomier feel for the size. The bad - we had a power outage for a few hours during the night, the whole neighborhood, not HGI's fault, but there are no emergency lights in the room, so if you didn't have phone or flashlight nearby, it was very dark (room darkening shades work well). The front door of the hotel is locked 24/7, making me wonder about the neighborhood. Our keys were either improperly programmed or were deprogrammed somehow and it took 2 trips to get them reprogrammed, the first one didn't work, and of course it happened when friends were waiting for us. The housekeeping staff tried to barge in our room at 8 a.m., check out was at noon and after getting up for an hour for the power outage, we were trying to sleep in. Then they went to the next room and banged the vacuum against the wall and adjoining room door waking us again. When I brought these issues with the desk on checkout, I was offered a bottle of water for my trouble, a less than satisfactory response. If the customer service was a bit better, it might have increased the rating.Hi Tom. Thank you very much for your feedback. While we're very glad to hear there were some aspects of your stay that went well, we deeply apologize for the other instances you mentioned. We're especially sorry to hear that you left with a less than satisfactory response from our front desk. We strive to ensure all of our guests leave happy and satisfied with their stay and we apologize that you did not. We have reviewed this with our team and can assure you this is not typical of our property. We hope you'll give us another opportunity to showcase our property next time you find yourself in Atlanta. Thank you again for bringing these items to our attention.",Bad
"The hotel is located next to a very noisy highway. The bathroom was very dirty and the room cooling/heating unit was very noisy. I was not made aware that there was a breakfast included so I could at least enjoy something from this hotel. I checked out after the first night of a 2 night stay and went to the Hilton Bayfront for almost the same money and a MUCH BETTER experience.Dear Bernard B,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we appreciate your feedback. We are sorry you had some noise issues and concerns with your room and if you had let the front desk know, we would have done our best to move you to a more quiet room and address your concerns.

I asked for my parking spot as a guest and they respond they were full and send me across the street to park my car to Komo plaza and pay 60 usd by my own for 2 nights. At least I was expected any courtesy or a refund of 60 usd from the hotel.Too bad.,Bad
"I made a reservation at this hotel through the Marriott 800 number using reward points. The reservation was for three people and I later noticed we were given one bed. I called back several times finally speaking to a supervisor (Steven - a woman) who was no help and then hung up on me. I spent several hours on this issue being transferred multiple times to go back to the same queue with non one willing to give me any identifier number (such as an employee number so I could document). One of the worst customer services experiences I have ever had.To be fair, we did not stay at this hotel and cancelled the reservation. It was the Marriott reservations group that earned this one star - the only one star I have ever left on TripAdviosr. I didn't even know it was legal to give three people one bed.I'm so sorry to hear of the confusion and resulting frustration caused by the reservations error. Our Central Reservations team is generally top notch and it is obvious that they dropped the ball in your case.I'm sorry you did not get a chance to experience the hotel, but we certainly hope you may have the opportunity to stay with us in the future.",Bad

I pulled back the covers on the bed to make sure the sheets had been changed and there was a plastic wrapper and a dirty wash rag. Needless to say, we went downstairs and said, please put us in another room.

"I'm a frequent traveler, mostly for business, and stay with Hilton-brand hotels about 90 of the time. I needed a local hotel near a facility I was spending a lot of time at recently, so I chose this Hampton.The rate was nothing to write home about...high for a Hampton in most places (165/night) but it was convenient to where I needed to be.Where do I start The rooms are old and worn...bed quality was fair, at best, with no choice of pillows except for feather-stuffed (I really need something with more support.) The hotel Wi-Fi is probably the WORST I've experienced at any hotel anywhere in the US...constantly dropping signal...poor strength...just really frustrating!And then, to top everything off, my schedule changed and I was able to depart a day early, but because (despite my HHonors status) I checked out at 11 minutes past 3PM...I had to pay for the entire next night. Now, I would have been fine with a late-checkout fee...no problem...but an entire night's cost---just ridiculous and something I have NEVER had happen at any other Hilton-branded hotel anywhere.Just bad all the way around!

The pictures from the Chelsea hotel website are not bad (DONT GET FOOLED!) and hence I booked it for 15 of my friends. On arrival we were told we are not in the main tower but the side building the Annex (Annex - the hotel website does not have pictures from the Annex, how could they!). The walk from the lobby to the Annex was pretty shady, the elevator looked like the freight elevator, the hallway from the elevator to the room had used furniture and appliances lying on the floor, on arriving in the room the decor was piecemeal together (nothing matched), the room had stains all over the carpet, on taking the shower (I was hammered by the time I got in the shower - still wondering why did I go to the shower) there was slim in the bath tub.

The next night we chose to pay for the valet service at 35.00 a night. because once we did more driving around we realized it was a very bad neighbourhood, not child friendly or even adult friendly for that matter .

"My fianc and I decided to have a last minute moment of relaxation over the weekend (June 25,2016) before our upcoming July 9th wedding so we decided to hit the beach and stay for an evening. I will say the woman who helped me book over the phone was lovely and the front desk person was also wonderful. We walked into our room at The Annex on the third floor and I walked out after just 15 minutes. The front desk was called and we unfortunately could not switch rooms or hotels so we decided to just check out and leave. The room felt grimy it was scorching hot, cigarette burns on the floor, dirty ceiling and my city view was a garage. It did not smell clean or pleasant. I was so disappointed. The front desk person was VERY apologetic and said he would try to get me a full refund. I saw that this hotel was under the Cape Resorts Group and that is so sad because I have had wonderful experiences at the Virginia Hotel and Congress Hall. This was just a bad experience and waste of money that I may never be refunded, which is awful especially when its just 2 weeks before my wedding and we tried to spend our money as wisely as possible.

"Our family of five (myself, my wife, and our three daughters) had booked a room as part of a block of guests for my wife's cousin's wedding on Saturday, onsite at the St. Regis hotel scheduled for 6:00 pm. I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic, they tried to offer a handicap accessible room, which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart, tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding, now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room, but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job, when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice, or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us, they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case, I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review, because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize on behalf of our entire staff for the extended delay upon arrival to your room and the multiple inconveniences that were caused to you and your family.

"On entry, the lobby was quite tired: old carpet, paint chipping, etc. Hallways and room had a old, dusty odor, but the window did open, so we could get fresh air. Everything in the bedroom was old (not quite historic), with rusty fixtures in the bathtub. We were on the fourth floor, so it took a long time on our first morning to get steady hot water, and then later that afternoon - no hot water at all. There is no excuse for a lack of hot water at a hotel in the Second City.The price should have given me a clue. I read the reviews here before booking and lent more credence to those that saw it as 'quaint', but in reality it's just bad. I need to be renovated top to bottom.Staff were nice enough, and maybe in the 'home country' this hotel might have been acceptable, but not here, not in Chicago, not in any major US city.Would have been much better to spend the extra 200 and stay at the Willows one block away.We apologize about the issues you had while staying at our hotel. We are not sure why you had issues with the hot water. We had not received any complaints so it may have been isolated to your room only.

"Last trip I refrained from reviewing after a rather bad experience. I believed it was a one shot occurrence. Last trip, I was given room keys that didn't work for the parking. Returned to the desk and received a lukewarm sorry. I stayed for 4 nights. My room was left completely un-cleaned one day and not well cleaned the other. When I informed the front desk, another lukewarm sorry. After I asked to see the manager, the desk person offered reward points instead because the manager was not available. Arrived today, front parking attendant asked for my car key while I checked into the hotel. Mind you, the front desk is in view from the entry way. I haven't been asked that in the last 2 visits. I asked him why and he said that people parked there and left their cars. He needed my key in case I did that. He reluctantly gave me a ticket after I asked - his reasoning was I can see you from here at the desk. Huh Wasn't that my reasoning as well except as the customer A rewards member, I was asked for my information though the person making the reservation a month ago took all my information. Got my keys - one opens the parking deck and one opens the room door, but neither does both. Can't wait to see what else I encounter while here.",Bad
"I was disappointed about the Hampton Inn Del Mar. My preferences as Hilton Honors member were ignored. The room we were given overlooked a Taco Bell and the freeway. Needless to say the noise level was great. The front desk staff simply did not care about our satisfaction. The lamps did not work. I have stayed at Hampton Inns before and have been satisfied but this was not the case with this hotel. On a positive note the breakfasts were pretty good.Thank you for your review. We highly appreciate your feedback and sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay.

"Worst experience ever! We were in ATL to attend the Alabama vs Virginia Tech game. Lots going on in Atlanta this weekend, the game, the Braves, Nascar, Dragacon, and more. We were excited to get a room downtown so last minute, when we made the reservation only 4 days earlier. We went to check in early and the rooms were not ready. OJ at front desk told us we could go ahead and park and check in after the game. We asked twice if we needed a parking pass and were told no. Parked below the motel and walked almost 2 miles to the Dome. Rather than have a huge towing bill and walk 2 miles we would have driven and paid 40 and parked near the Dome. Called after the game to make sure we were still good and let them know we would check in late to please not give up our room. We were assured everything was fine and we needed to check in my midnight, we got to the hotel with five minutes to spare. The night clerk proceeded to check up in and pulled out a parking pass. RED FLAG!!!! We told him we had asked for one early in the day and didn't receive one. My husband ran down to check and sure enough our truck had been towed. The clerk wanted us to check in our room and spend the night and deal with our missing truck the next day. NO WAY!!! All of our belongings were in our truck. When we finally found out where if had been towed we had to take a cab across town. Luckily we had a wonderful cab driver who helped us out a lot, stayed with us until he was sure we would get our truck back and warned us about quickly getting out of the area and not stopping because we were in a very bad part of town. The tow company wouldn't accept my debit or credit card, they needed my husbands. Thankfully I had some cash (which I rarely have). We finally got our truck and drove the very late 2 hour drive home. We found out that 10 vehicles were towed from this location that night. We feel very strongly that this was a scam between the desk clerk and the tow company. The man at the impound lot told us he had never know of them taking cars from this location until yesterday when they got 10 from there. Don't be the next victim.",Bad

Also, our second night our room was not made up or clean towels when we arrived back at 11pm. When we asked why at the front desk we were told because we had the Do not disturb sign on our door still at 10am. However someone was in our room because our air conditioner was shut off. The front desk staff both at night and the next morning basically did not care because we booked through Expedia and not them. The staff for the continental breakfast were so sweet polite and helpful. I enjoyed seeing them every morning.Our last night all we heard all night was a dog barking. Again the staff said Well people sneak dogs in. And then pretty much shrugged there shoulder in a not caring action.I will definitely not stay here again when I visit my daughter at school.",Bad

"This was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, we travel a lot and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I have reviewed a lot of hotels and I rarely leave a bad review, but this was too disgusting to not address.We were moving my cousin to Orlando, and needed a late night hotel last minute. We picked the best western, in hind sight I wish we had slept in the car. We checked in around 1 am. Once we got settled in and ready for bed, we started seeing small roaches crawling out from behind the painting above our bed. My husband killed the 2 that we saw. We were a little grossed out but that late at night, we didn't have many options. The next morning we woke up to more roaches crawling around the painting. Then we saw a couple of huge ones above the TV. After seeing this we wondered how many more were in the room. We grabbed our stuff went to front desk and told them. She refunded us 50 . My husband emailed the manager STUART BLOOMBERG about this. He emailed us back and told us the exterminators came and said the room was perfectly clean and there wasn't a single roach. So either we saw the only 4 roaches in the room or someone is not being honest. My husband relayed to Stuart how grossed out we were and asked for the remainder of balance to be refunded. Stuart told us he can't do that the roaches must have entered the room when we opened the door to enter the room ourselves. At this point not only were we disgusted by the pest infested room but also insulted by the manager that he would accuse us of letting the roaches in. We are realistic, a bug here and there is normal, but a roach infested room is a sign of filth. We are so disappointed, what a waste of money, and such poor customer service. STAURT BLOOMBERG offered us 50 off on our next stay, as if we would EVER go back to that hotel. I have never left a hotel feeling this disgusted. A word of advice to the manager of this hotel, don't blame your customers for your hotels lack of hygiene. Unprofessional staff, filthy hotel, stay somewhere else.Dear Deepti DI really appreciate you taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize again as did my staff did for the failure in our extermination program. My staff did reduce your stay to 50 off before you checked out.A pest free environment is basic for a good stay. I am sorry if that was not the case during your stay. You can be confident that we did follow-up on your concerns, so that others are not disappointed as you were.Again, thank you for making the effort to share your thoughts. We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns! Please stay with us again soon, so that we can demonstrate our commitment to your comfort.",Bad
"Booked this hotel for the price. Amazing price, great location but.....you get what you paid for. One of the beds were broken, the room smelled like bug spray (I guess at least they spray), no hot water in the shower, the property looks like a prison, carpet was at least 400yrs old. But, location is 1mi from universal and will serve its purpose for one night at that great price.",Bad
"It s bad hotel with terrible and dishonest management. Expect to be without room if you arrive late. For them it does not matter that you have reservation, they just simply give away your room.

I want to personally apologize for not having a room for you.

"I picked this location because it was close to MCO, relatively affordable, and had a free airport shuttle. The room was ok, though is showing wear (for example, bathroom tiles were cracked and some grout was missing). The linens were very cheap and coarse (I quite literally got rug burn on my elbow from rolling over in the night). The shuttle to the airport in the morning was fine, but I couldn't get the front desk to stay on the line long enough to get picked up from the airport after returning my rental car (seriously irritating when someone answers the phone and immediately puts you on hold before taking 30 seconds or less to understand the reason for the call). I spent about 10 minutes on hold (despite trying to call 3 different times) and eventually took a cab to the hotel (which annoyed the cabbie greatly since it was a short fare).Given this experience, I wouldn't recommend staying here unless it's the cheapest cost. It was reasonably quiet and I slept ok all things considered, but there are several options in the immediate vicinity.Dear Falconsview, thank you for sharing your experience and for being our guest. While overall you had a pleasant stay, we are unhappy with the lack of service received from our front desk staff.

"We stayed at this hotel last year for 10 nights and while the rooms weren't completely up to date, it was clean, had extra room, breakfast was decent, and for the price we felt we got a great deal. Based on our past experience, we booked again for a family reunion and referred our family to also book this hotel. We arrived late at night and check in was fine. The lobby still looked nice and the elevator was still slow like we remembered. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room and turned the bed down were the yellow stains on the sheets. At this point I wasn't sure if the sheets had been laundered and they were permanent stains, or if the sheets had not been changed. I called the front desk and they had me come get a new set of sheets. By the time I got back up to the room, my husband had discovered the towels hanging in the bathroom had fresh lipstick/makeup all over them. I went back to talk to the front desk and the employee decided it was time to try a different room. Room 2 had a ant on top of the pillows on the bed and when we turned down the bed and pulled the pillows away from the headboard out ran 10 more. Back to the front desk we went and were now headed off to room 3. When opening the door to Room 3 we were immediately hit with what I can only describe as B.O. and it was potent. I called the front desk and told them about the smell and told them we would tough it out for the night as it was getting super late and we had a baby with us. I asked when the manager would be in the next day and was told 10 a.m. I ran the air vent on the airconditioner and also turned on the bathroom exhaust fan all night. The next morning the smell was as bad as ever. It literally was oozing out of everything in the room-the mattress, the couch. There were ants in this room also, but they were crawling on the wall instead of instead of in the bed. I headed down to visit with the manager of the hotel and found he was out due to an emergency. I expressed my concerns to the staff that was there (the housekeeping supervisor and a young gentleman) and asked to cancel the rest of my stay as well as the reservations for my family that would be arriving in town later in the week. The housekeeping supervisor came up to the room and acknowledged the smell and thought that it was possibly wet carpet-my opinion was that the room smelled due to body odor and not cleaning the room thoroughly. The only rooms the hotel had left were double rooms and she offered to let me walk through one before moving all of my belongings again, but I declined as we had already switched rooms 3 times and I also was very concerned about how many times my family coming into town would have to switch rooms to find an acceptable one.This hotel has drastically gone down hill in cleanliness since we stayed here last year. The linens in all of the rooms were stained and the towels were threadbare and grey. There were ants in 2 of the 3 rooms we checked into that night. I felt this hotel was along the lines of a motel 6 at best. Free breakfast cannot make up for a filthy hotel that is not being cleaned properly. We actually witnessed a maid RUNNING into and out of a room in less than 5 minutes. How do you clean a room that fast And we certainly didn't see a vacuum. We were wondering if the maids were paid by the room and not the hour. I do want to say the front desk staff was very accommodating and tried their hardest to find an acceptable room and I appreciate that they were willing to cancel our reservations when they realized their hotel had too many issues. ****PLEASE HIRE A SUPERVISOR FOR YOUR MAIDS AND INVEST IN REPL.ACING OLD/STAINED LINENS AND TOWELS***Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at the Comfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area in San Diego.

"When we got there to check in, they made us pay a 50 deposit per room that they neglected to mention on the phone when the rooms were booked. So instead of renting two rooms as planned, we had to rent just one.The A/C in the room was terrible, it hardly cooled the room down - probably because the insulation was so bad you could see the sunlight around the edges of the room door (which also meant you could hear every person running by and yelling at all hours). The sink in our room also clogged several times.We found several cockroaches crawling in various places (including the bed). We all have random bug bites now, probably from mosquitoes coming in thanks to the poorly sealed door. There were odd stains on the ceiling as well.The free WIFI came in and out, and it interrupts your browsing with full in-browser ads, which actually gave our laptop a virus. It slowed down our computer noticeably during our stay so we checked when we got home and had to remove it.They gave us two tiny bottles of shampoo (no conditioner) and two bars of soap, for a room that's supposed to sleep four people. Three towels, and two hand towels. There was no ice machine, and you have to pay for a mini fridge. They also had no complimentary breakfast in the mornings.All in all, a huge disappointment and we definitely will not be staying at this hotel again. Don't recommend it to anyone else.",Bad

"I'm a big fan of Best Western Hotels, because the majority of them accomodate my German Shepherd dog, this one is no exception except the other reason that I like Best Western is because the majority of them are designed well, and are well maintained, and offer rooms that feel fresh and clean, the Best Western Mission Bay seems to be the exception to the rule. The main parking lot features a poor design, it is difficult to navigate when stuffed full of trucks, and other vehicles that should have been parked in the overflow lot provided to the side of the hotel. There were derelicts floating about the hotel and parking lot, which made me wonder whether my car and the contents would be there when I awoke in the morning, I was on a road trip back to Mexico with a full load and didn't really want to have to unpack an entire SUV late at night and have to try to piece it all back together in the morning. The room felt stale and just not clean, although I'm sure that it was, it just didn't feel clean, or look clean, the place is in need of an overhaul and I feel that I could have just crashed at a Motel 6 and left the next day feeling like I needed a shower just the same.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.I apologize you were unable to find a parking space by your room.

"I basically live out of hotels and this is the WORST I have ever seen. Staring with parking you are paying 12.00 for a spot that you have to do a 3 point turn to get into and my Camry almost didnt fit into. The room was super small for being a family suite and everything was cramped. The was enough space between the foot of the bed and the tv table was wide enough for a vacuum to fit though as well as the space between the bed and the wall. The second room was divided by a French door only the fixed side of the French door had window covering so there is no privacy between rooms and the lights from either room shines into each other. The AC was weak and smelt like mold. The second room never got air and by the time you go to the bathroom forget it just open the window to let the air in. There is no circulation, except what was provided by a large fan in the wall between rooms that was extremely loud and reminded me of an attic fan. One good thing the bed was comfortable for a single night stay. This location does offer breakfast, but after making a waffle and getting a plate together and sitting down to eat each of us took a bite and ended up at Dennys down the street. I wasnt expecting a Hilton or the Ritz Carlton, but I was expecting something a little higher than what ended up looking like highway motel. Lucky for us we were there only one night before heading home to Los Angeles.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. I greatly appreciate your comments about aspects of the room that need updating.

"Picked this Hotel, because it was within walking distance of a concert venue my mistake (I should have done more research). Sadly, the area is not the best (within one block east south there are considerable numbers of poor unfortunate people living on the sidewalk, in tents, in cardboard boxes and cars). Although, we did not have any trouble whatsoever we did witness open (injected) drug use on the street. Some may call it edgy or off the tourist track. Certainly not a place for families with young children to visit. During our visit we met a retired SF Social worker who told us Hyde St. (300s) is one of the dirtiest locations in the city and a good many of this former clients came from around that area.The hotel building (c.1904) was clean inside and the staff more than helpful. Out first room, on the fourth floor, although a double, was a disappointment very small and cramped, no draw space, tiny shower room, single glazing, overlooking the main street, very noisy (there is an Emergency Hospital directly opposite with vehicles coming in though-out the night).Our second room (floor two) was much larger, with ample cupboard/draw space and a bath and was situated at the rear of the building clean, but, again a little tired.There are a few places to eat nearby again, some care would be needed, not to go down the wrong street.The nearest public transport (Cable Car on the California line) is two blocks to the north and a 20minute ride will connect you with the downtown financial district.Pros: Price!Cons: Location.Visit Again: No, sadly, the adjacent area is too distressed.We were pleased to host you during your stay in San Francisco, and we hope that you enjoyed your trip to the city. It is also good to hear that the hotel itself was good, and we trust that you rested well. We know that the homelessness that is evident throughout the city can be very disconcerting for those who are not used to it, and we are sorry that you found aspects of this to be so off-putting. Please know that this is replicated throughout the city. Thankfully, our guests are never approached by people, and despite appearances, our area is very safe. Our building and some of our furniture are quite old, but we trust that you noticed the wonderful standard of cleanliness and upkeep that we maintain, and we hope that this did not detract from your stay too much. Overall, we are sorry that you did not enjoy your time here more. Best wishes, Hotel Management",Bad
"Yes the receptionist was very professional, and upon enterence into the hotel it was nice and the breakfast was good. However I choose this hotel because of the name and it did not meet the standards that I'm use to when staying at a Wingate Hotel and for the price it truely did not match. The pictures looked better online than in person. The door to the hotel room did not open properly, the toilet was very loose and when me or the kids sat on it, it shook - the tub was not properly cleaned so we used the towels to put down on the bottom of the tub. The money I spent on the room did not match the quality of the hotel's name which is why I choose it. For what we got we could have stayed at a motel 6 for a approximately half the price. The computer really sits by the front door and not in a computer room.The location was O.K.Please accept my sincere apology regarding your recent stay at the BRAND of Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. Teyonna what you experienced is not the standard we strive to uphold. We have reviewed our procedures and made appropriate changes to prevent this from occurring in the future.

"From the time we pulled into the parking lot, then we went in and the smell was horrible. went to the room, the hallways smelled of smoke. and the room was ok. no wash cloths and no sheets or blankets for the pull out bed..The stay was no pleasant at all.Please accept our sincere apologies for the problems you encountered. You deserved a comfortable and stress-free stay, and we did not live up to your expectations.

We deeply regret the inconvenience caused, and please give us another opportunity to serve you better in the future. Sincerely,General Manager",Bad
We stayed there for multiple nights and from a family of six three of us became sick and after passing it off as exhaustion we later found black mold on our clothes. Headaches sore throats and rashes and coughing all night .we stayed in a room right across from the pool which may have increased the mold and to honest I'm not from a high humidity area so maybe this is common but we have stayed other places in Anaheim for longer and have not experienced this. Everyone says we just need a place to sleep and nothing great .that's what you get here.,Bad
"We have traveled extensively prior, and have stayed at many hostels of similar price range, this one however, is a whole new experience for us. At the check in, the staff opened not with the availabilities of their facilities, but with the offer of free alcohol, every single day. What they didn't say, was that the staff themselves drank most of the free booze, and were hungover most of their shifts. The were more interested in sharing their drunken antics rather than providing any help to the customers. There was only one girl Billy who spoke English (and she's the least useful one out of them all), the rest of the staff spoke very little English and had trouble understanding us.The free alcohol turned lots of the hostel guests into violent drunks, who threw knives at each other in the kitchen whilst cooking.Hostel was extremely noisy and was impossible to sleep without earplugs. The mattress was creaky and filthy, and we didn't even dare to cover ourselves with their blankets, on which we had presumed was dried blood.",Bad
Yeah so as named it wz really a pathetic experience to stay in this hotel. It was so dirty n the disk staff r v rude. Especially the ticket selling lady. So shouts n yell at da ppl working there. When v booked da rooms the didn't said anything about extra charges if u book it on trip advisor b5 the charged us extra 2.5 for Dat. The laundry is out of service n da lift is so scary. It makes noises. Not at all recommended to any 1 visiting orlando.,Bad
"My husband and I were excited to stay at Estancia last week to celebrate my 30th birthday. Upon check-in, here are the things we noticed in our room that led us to believe it wasnt a luxury resort, as claimed:-Dirty diaper in our bathroom garbage-Dirty towels in a heap-Items in fridge from last guest-Opened water bottles (included in the outrageous 22/day resort fee)We were very nice about this and called the front desk just to mention it and ask for new water bottles although I think we should have made more of a fuss because a dirty diaper is pretty disgusting.What makes me the most upset about this resort is the service from the concierge. My parents ordered a cheese plate and bottle of wine to be delivered to our room upon our arrival because that was the day of my birthday. My mom was guaranteed that it would be delivered to our room within 30-45 minutes of our check-in, which would mean that the gift was delivered on my actual birthday. We did not receive the cheese plate or bottle of wine that day. On Saturday, just before noon, we received a cheese plate delivered to our room. I immediately contacted my parents to say thank you for the cheese plate, and my mom asked if there had been a bottle of wine with it, which I told her there had not. She contacted the hotel, got no answer, and left a message. I called in-room dining to inquire about the wine. They told me that they thought they would deliver the cheese plate in the morning and the wine after dinner. If someone orders wine and cheese as a gift, its because they want them to be enjoyed together, so this was obviously a lie.This entire time, my mom had been dealing with Gabby, who was rude, interrupted her, and didnt let her speak. When Gabby called back, my mom complained that the gift was not delivered on my birthday as promised, and was not delivered in its entirety. Gabby assured my mom that she would take some money off because of this, but my mom checked her banking and she had been charged an additional 35. When my mom called Gabby to talk about this, Gabby did apologize. However, she was still incredibly rude and told her that I had actually received the wine and cheese on Friday, but that I just didnt call my mom to thank her and that I lied when I said we didnt receive anything Friday. So not only was our room dirty upon check in, with a dirty diaper and more, but my mom tried to do something nice for us and the hotel has responded by being incredibly rude and accusing us of lying. The 35 has been taken off, but my parents are still paying full price for a gift that wasnt delivered on time, having to contact the hotel 6-7 times while my mom was on vacation, and being accused of lying.I left a voicemail for the manager two days ago and have not heard back. I will never stay at this luxury resort again.Thank you for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us on Trip Advisor. Your experience was certainly not indicative of our service standards, and it is simply saddening to read of your negative experience. We are though, happy that we are given this opportunity to personally apologize for the multiple mishaps you encountered during your stay. We know how important the little things are (especially on ones birthday) and I regret that we are unable to go back and fix the situation first hand. We appreciate your comments and will be researching the situation in more depth in order to prevent any experience such as yours from reoccurring. I sincerely hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and want to thank you again for your review.If you could please check your private messages we have sent you an email to further follow-up on your experience.",Bad

"Let me start off by saying I am a marriott Gold Status member who logged 50+ nights at Marriotts last year and year-to-date has logged 41 nights with Marriott. I'm always on the lookout for reasonably priced business hotels. Let's just say that this isn't one of them. Several Cons about the hotel and rooms:- There are no irons in the rooms, you have to go to a communal ironing room. This makes it weird when you have to get dressed in the morning to go iron your clothes. For the road warrior who likes to iron in the AM after they get out of the shower, it makes it awkward.. - The showers are literally in the bedroom with no defined bathroom area. When you get out of the shower onto the wood floors, you get water all over the floors next to your bed area. - The rooms are the sizes of coffins. - There is absolutely no storage in the rooms for clothes (no closet, no real hanger system to hang work shirts or coats, no drawers. You have no option other than to live out of a suitcase, which is even a problem because there is no real benching area or room to put your suitcase. The goal of this hotel is to create an experience for the guest. They want the guest to be driven out of the room to the common area lobbies to spend time with other guests and to spend money in the lobby. Unfortunately for those of us who need to do work or are looking for some relaxing quiet time, this hotel doesn't allow you to accomplish that. When you are in the lobby, they are blaring club music and at night times, they have a DJ who also blares club music. It's just a lot of crummy club music. The other issue I had was the excessive promotion of alcohol consumption. It was no stop. Although I enjoy alcohol, I could see how someone who didn't or who is in recovery from alcohol could feel weird when staying here. For someone who has stayed at Marriotts roughly 50 times per year for business and for pleasure, i would never recommend someone going to this hotel. It's a terrible hotel with minimal space and an overarching desire to try to be overly cool. I can't stress how much i actually hated staying at this hotel. It was terrible.Hello 575bjacobs,We are so sorry to hear about the poor experience you had at the Moxy Chicago. Our goal is for our guests to be comfortable and enjoy all of our unique amenities and we hate that we let you down. We value every bit of feedback - good, bad, and in-between. We do now offer irons, upon request, in our guest rooms, along with additional hangers and storage containers that slide directly under the bed in order to help better cater to the needs of our beloved business travelers. We hate to see you leave, but realize the Moxy experience may not be for everyone or those expecting the traditional hotel stay. While we know this does not help your experience, we hope you will accept our apologies. We wish you the safest of travels.Peace. Love. Moxy",Bad
"Old tired hotel. My room was right on the edge of a 10 lane highway and I had to sleep with ear plugs. Although clean, the room was old with cracks in the walls, saggy beds and grey towels. One evening we had no water at all for about an hour. One morning we had no hot water. Staff were pleasant and did their best but they don't have much to work with. Wifi so slow it was useless and I was forced to link to my cell phone.",Bad
"I booked my stay here for my birthday weekend March 28th-March 30th through booking.com The hotel was clean, and the front desk reps/cleaning crew was very nice and cheerful! The stay there wasn't bad at all, well....that's until I got home and two days later I check my bank account to see that I was charged for a total of 3nights instead of 2. When I called to inquire about this. I spoke to Jenny, the same nice,cheerful rep I saw when I checked in. I guess that was a front! She was very RUDE! She was talking over me and insisted it was a bank error and not Hampton Inn fault. She kept saying what does your reciet say I told her the recit states the correct amount, however, I was charged a addional night. She still was rude and nasty! I asked ti speak to the geneal manager, and she kept saying she was in a meeting. I told Jenny how this has compromised my account,and I need reinbursement. She hung up on me!! I will NEVER stay there again!! I advise everyone to check your account twice! They will jip you!!Dear Guest,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimiter Center. I am sorry that you felt that Jenny our guest service agent was rude to you. I personally looked at your account and you were charged the correct amount for your room. As per your request after speaking with you I called your bank and had them remove an aurthorization amount off of your account that your banking institution was holding. I am sorry that this was an issue while a guest at our hotel. We hope that this clears up any misunderstanding and hope that you will choose to stay with us again.",Bad
"What else is there to say Two word review: bed bugs. No one or two bed bugs...I came out with 30+ bites. It is easy to call this a nightmarish experience. If you value your sanity, please, I implore you, pay the extra money and don't even consider this place for one second.",Bad
"You'll never get to sleep. The only advantage of the continuously loud, throbbing dance music is that it drowns out the traffic noise from the street. I, too, was suckered by the glowing reviews, but in reality, this is a refurbished motel that has cleverly marketed itself as a hip destination spot. It's located in a nondescript area of town, and the furnishings are Ikea-quality generic modern. The pool is small and filled with plastic balls, making it all but unusable. The attraction of this place seems to be the bar, which unfortunately is in an open courtyard, which means you get to hear the music all night, whether you want to or not. The crowd is young, as is the staff. If you are, too, and are on vacation, you might like this place. But don't stay here for business.",Bad
"We were given a room infested with fleas. First noticed while lying in bed and got bit. Thought it was a fleeting incident and left for the day. That night I was in bed and felt them on me, I got up walked across room and saw fleas were all over my lower legs. Needless to say I did not sleep that night. First thing in the morning asked for a new room and they did move us, however I was paranoid the fleas got into my things and would come home with me. So I felt very anxious and uncomfortable the rest of my stay. I have bite marks all over my legs. They didn't even offer a discount of any kind off that room price.Thank you for taking the time to write your review. I am very sorry that happened during your stay. I am very glad we were able to move you to another room, and we have gotten the original room taken care of. We do have a cleaning policy in place when we know a pet has been in a room. There was no record of any pets in that room for several months. Unfortunately, it sounds like someone may have had a pet in that room without us knowing. I have contacted you by phone, and would be happy to discuss this with you further.Thank you,Melissa AlbertGeneral Managermalbertstcharlesinn.net",Bad
I think the price for the rooms was overpriced. The room was not very clean for the and the exhaust fan in the bathroom was very loud. There is a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The refrigerator did keep the stuff cold.,Bad
"Was hesitant about this hotel after reading some of the reviews and my fears came to life as soon as we checked in. We had a room on the first floor with a kitchenette which smelled awful - evidently a souvenier from the last meal cooked there. The hotel is very outdated. I was told by the very nice desk clerk (who took me around the hotel attempting to find us another room) that they are in the process of updating Not to sure about that. Hotel is right on the strand. There is no A/C in the hallways and it appears that windows are usually kept open. We were supposed to stay two nights but left after one. Probably a great place for families on a budget with small children. Oh yeah, continental breakfast is juice boxes and poptarts basically. It is a good location though.",Bad
"I recently stayed at this property as it was listed as a three-diamond under AAA ratings and had bunk beds for my two young children. This hotel is not as nice as advertised. The room I had showed its age as it was looking dirty and worn. I also had one of the worst experiences I have ever had with the hotel personnel and management. Their customer service was very poor. On the second night of our stay the Toilet backed up a around 8:30 P.M. I called the front desk and was told there was no one who could fix it so I could move to another room. I declined this, as it would have taken at least an hour and a half to pack up, move, unpack and set up the room. My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive. I couldnt believe that they didnt have anyone who could plunge the toiled as this hotel has over 125 rooms. I asked if they had a plunger and the desk person stated he would look. He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused, and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service, she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel, or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information. I asked for the name of who hired her she stated herself, I asked if she was the owner. She again would only say she didnt have that information. Earlier I had asked for compensation for the situation she insulting only offered to pay for the plunger. In the room was a card titled commitment to your Satisfaction, It stated states that if youre not satisfied with our accommodations or service, please the front desk know so we can make it right. At this property from the general manager on down they do not follow this policy. They definitely did not make it right.",Bad

I know all hotels overbook but surely it's common courtesy to let you know before you arrive after a 9 hour flight and a couple of more hours getting through immigration, picking up a car and driving there.",Bad
"Centrally located, close to Pike Place and other key points of interest. Room was spacious, but unfortunately, I really missed their wonderful Heavenly Beds! They must not have these beds at this location, as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further, the water pressure in my room, located on the 10th floor, was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa, thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle.

"Your first difficulty if you drive to this location is going to be parking. Expect to pay up to 16.50 a day to park your car 2 blocks away at a parking garage. Once you get to the hotel you will need to climb 18 very steep stairs to get to the check in desk. No elevator. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful. Some of the rooms have windows that open into the hallway. I am sure that this may be quaint for some, but a huge privacy issue for others even if there is a blind that you can pull down. There are shared bathrooms (2 total) and you may be sharing it with 20 + other people. 2 showers are also shared. Not a lot of privacy. If your neighbors are loud, you will hear every single thing that is going on in the room next to you. The location is great with really everything within walking distance. Over all, this is an over priced hostel.Dear teasippinglou,Thank you for the nice comments about our location, cleanliness, and staff. Were sorry that there were some points that you did not meet with your approval. Bringing a car to San Francisco and parking it can be an expensive proposition. We advise guests to leave their cars at home, but we welcome those on a road trip and love them ourselves. Our rate for overnight parking is one of the best values in San Francisco. By comparison the hotel directly across from where we send our guests to park charges 45 per night and we charge only 16. Nob Hill hotels charge 60 per night and downtown hotels charge 62. So we feel our parking rate is very modest and a true value in keeping with our budget prices geared towards value-oriented travelers.The San Remo was built in 1906 and had no elevator. If anyone needs help with their baggage we would gladly bring their luggage up the one flight. The San Remo is only three stories high, is fully sprinkler-equipped, and is not required to have an elevator. Our stairs are up to code and are well lit. Were sorry that you missed some of our other bathing facilities but there are seven showers and a vintage claw-foot bathtub. They are all fully private and there is seldom any wait to use them. We are an historic Victorian hotel and not a hostel, although we are popular with backpackers looking for some comfort at a reasonable price. As far as our rates, we are well below the average for San Francisco. Rates within one block of our hotels great location range from 200 to 489. We have not had any complaints about privacy of our inside corridor rooms. They all have lace curtains and window shades. As far as noise, our walls are as thick as most other hotels, but due to the fact that we have no televisions which create a white-noise effect you may hear sounds that would normally be drowned out by them. We do provide ear plugs if needed.We hope you give us another try on your next trip from Alaska. When you return could you please say hello to Santa Claus for usTom Field",Bad

"I booked site unseen as I am a Best Western Rewards member. This hotel is older than the seven seas! The outside is old and needs maintenance, appearing more like a highway side trucker motel than a hotel. Rooms are old and musty, with water and moisture damage radiating from the bottom of the exterior door and bathroom door. I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy. Room appeared clean at first glance, but tile floor in shower/toilet area needed scrubbing and vanity looked like it was never dusted. Shower water was luke warm.Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.

"I had booked a reservation through Priceline.com for a non-smoking room. When I arrived at the hotel I was informed succinctly that my reservation came through for a smoking room. Although there were non-smoking rooms available, I was charged 11 to change to a non-smoking room. Calls from customer service agents at Priceline had no effect at all. The front desk clerk admitted to me that this happens very frequently (every day she said) to people who book through Priceline or Hotwire. I believe this hotel is running a scam to earn extra revenue by charging unsuspecting customers extra money for non-smoking rooms. Shameful. I will never stay there again.Let me start by thanking you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our property. I apologize for not exceeding your expectations.

I also confirmed an extended checkout time when checking in and the front desk assured me that I was all set.On day of check out I was told that I could not have a 1 hour extension.And last but not least I had requested the room cleaned before 2 pm... I was told that housekeepingwas being sent right up... that was at 11 am.

"I travel often to San Francisco (1-2 times a month) and while recently planning on going with my friends for a vacation I booked at Hotel Abri. Trying to save money, I found a decent deal for a hotel that had good reviews here. While not going into further detail, but noting that I had difficulty in checking-in due to housekeeping being short-staffed, there was much issue.The BIGGEST issue I had here was with getting spider bites from sleeping on the sofa bed. After showing the front desk, and after their inspection came out negative, they moved me rooms, but that was it. I still haven't heard back from a manager and was not offered any sort of compensation.I would suggest not going cheap and staying at the Parc 55 across the street.Dear Luke H.,Thank you for your time and for providing us with the details of your experience while staying with us at Hotel AbRi, I want to let you know that I am aware of the multiple interactions/communications with you regarding your check in, stay and insect bites, I want to assure you again that we have followed up with the staff and pest control teams with the same procedures as we communicated to you at the end of your stay that there was no evidence of pests in the room, after our professional vendor inspected and treated the room, we also provided you with the findings and communication. I want to again formally apologize to you and your guests for the multiple interactions and confusion regarding the check in, as our check in time is 3:00pm, however we always try to accommodate guests requests, and our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests, we were sold out the night before and also on the day of your arrival the requests are challenging to grant as our check out time is 12 noon. Also our apologies for the confusion on your reservation made by the third party which provided you with a One deluxe room with double double beds, not a two bedroom room, as stated, our front desk team did upgrade you to one of our Urban Suites to provide you with more space and a better stay for you and your guests. I am very sorry that even with the steps we took to upgrade your room type we failed to provide you a great stay, as this situation does not reflect our Hotel AbRis core values, style or caring approach, we totally understand your point of view, but we would like to let you know that our teams are diligently working with our third party partners to resolve these type of situations, so it would not affect other guests as it affected you. However this is not an excuse for the actions or scenario you described, during your stay we really tried to provide you with all the upgraded amenities our Urban welcome provides, but as we can see we fail on the communication and we will work on getting better. I can assure you that the sequences of events you have presented are not in any way, our teams guest service standards or company goals. I want you to know our leadership and service team have followed the procedures as we are truly concern and sadden by the details of your experience, and we want to again apologize on this format as we have done for the past days during communications with you. I would like to request from you another opportunity to further discuss and try to turn this situation from a negative experience to a positive, as we value our guests feedback. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800, we are anxious to show you the caring, casual and family atmosphere we promote in our Hotel. Thank you again for your feedback and I look forward to speaking with you. Have a great day!EJ Varela Hotel Manager",Bad
"The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you. We thank you for giving us another opportunity. We sincerely hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans. As always, if we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.

"The Hotel has terrible WiFi that randomly disconnects every few seconds. The parking is bad and there are only like 2 elevators. This hotel is not meant for disabled people or elderly, even those who have trouble walking up stairs or have bad knees. I had to carry all my suitcases up three flight of stairs just to get to my room. I even had to help two elderly people carry their suit cases up the stairs. The layout of the hotel map is confusing as it is. If anything the Hotel needs to add more elevators for each building and not only for two buildings. The only reason I booked this hotel was due to the lack of hotels during Comic Con. I won't be going to this hotel again.I am so sorry to hear you experienced inconveniences while getting around the property. This is not the kind of experience we want our guests to have. Our team can usually assist folks with luggage and getting to the room, as most hours we do have a bellman. Also, seven of our eight buildings have elevators.

"Booked a night here through hotels.com Cost 167. Saved between 30 and 40 off the hotel website.The hotel is very small, the room was stuck in the 80s, the elevator was covered in graffiti and it was faster to take the stairs.It was noisy in the room. We could hear people in the other rooms and the wi-fi kicked uis out everytime we turned off our ipads. It would not allow our phones to log in.I was not comfortable letting my children leave the room at all without a parent even into the outdoor hallway which is accessible to anybody, including non hotel guests.The parking lot is so small all cars were doubled parked. The front desk does keep the keys of people double parked to let you out though.This was the worst breakfast of our 2 week trip. Cold donuts and muffins with tea or coffee (no milk or cream, just dried cream substitute).I would recommend some place that cost 50 more that has a better breakfast, more secure rooms and better parking.The only positive thing from this stay was the two people working the front desk were both very polite and helpful at finding things in San Francisco.",Bad

"The area was just off a busy freeway in what we described as the stripper neighborhood. I needed early checkin which I arranged months ago. Didn't get it. When we were able to check in noticed wet section if carpet. Thought maybe they cleaned something up. Next morning 1/4 room saturated. Went to front desk. They said probably Ac problem. They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd, I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No, we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no, fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left. Thank you for your feedback. I apologize that we were unable to fix your air conditioning issue immediately. Through our several interactions with you early in the day, you were offered a room move several times until we could get the resources to fix the leak in your air conditioning. I am sorry that the staff that you spoke with were not more empathetic, but they did offer you alternate accommodations. We try to honor early check in requests, but that is dependent on the departure patterns and how quickly we can clean the rooms for the new arrivals. I hope that this does not prohibit you from joining us again.",Bad
"I can't even begin to review this hotel. This hotel is SOOOOO dated.The elevator has a gate and a door and it doesn't stay open.

I just can't believe that they didn't at least try to fix it so that it stays open so that you can get in with luggage into elevator.I have to say it was a struggle to get in. NOT FUN!! The room was clean but very tight. I had a full bed and my luggage was on the other half of the bed. No room to put luggage anywhere but on the bed. Good thing I was on my own. Sink was in the bedroom. We are sorry that overall, you did not love your stay with us.

"Do not stay at the hotel Allegro if you value professional courtesy, stable internet connections, or not being subjected to overhearing whatever television show or casual conversation in which the next room is engaged. The beds are small as well. If you're over 6 ft like me, stay somewhere else. Most infuriating of all was my experience with the internet. It was down consistently. It turns out that there was an issue with the router on my floor -- which in and of itself is not a deal breaker. But they asked me to call their tech support staff, which is odd because the guests shouldn't be the ones troubleshooting internet connectivity. I spoke with the technician for around 25 minutes before he figured out the cause. By this point, the meeting that I was supposed to be attending via teleconference was almost halfway over. I marched to the front desk and asked for a new room and was made to feel like a criminal. One of the desk staff actually smirked at me as I described my difficulties. I lost business because I stayed here. Do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake of staying at the Hotel Allegro.Ouch! I'm so sorry to hear that your internet connection was so unstable and that you missed the conference call that you were supposed to attend.

"I wish I had the opportunity to rate my experience at this hotel, but I never got the chance to even book my reservation.I had done a lot of resarch on hotels for my upcoming visit to San Francisco in two months, and was very pleased to find the Orchard Garden Hotel. When I did more research, I discovered in the specials section of their website that they offer a discounted rate of 149 for a superior king room when you book three consecutive nights (San Francisco Triple Play special valid through 8/31). When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of 213 a night, 64 more a night!Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention.Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts. I'm very disappointed.",Bad

"So the hotel has a shuttle service from the airport that they told me about when I contacted them earlier in the day. Very pleasant lady I spoke with and extremely helpful. Got off the plane and called to let them know we were here. The driver will be there shortly (remember that phrase, there's a pattern here). Waited 20 minutes and called back same phrase. Did that twice more. The last time I called with attitude she told me the driver had just picked someone up on the A side and after he dropped them off, they would come back for us (the A spots were just across the street). Well, I was none too pleased to put it mildly after waiting that long. Had she been upfront with us, we would have taken a cab the 1 mile or so, which we ended up doing. When we got here to check in, her comment was, instead of I'm sorry for the inconvenience, it was not my problem, they are short a driver tonight. What!!! When I asked to speak to a manager, she said no, there is no manager here and you can deal with me. WHAT!!! It went downhill from there. Can't believe the attitude that was being thrown my way from some twenty year old. Finally just took my keys and left (fortunately I had already checked in online) was a long day. The rooms were adequate although there were mystery smears on the inside of the bathroom door. Went to speak with the front desk this morning but he was again a twenty year old (I guess get done with high school and start working at the hilton). Well, luckily again, I have more Hilton Honors points than I can ever use (and have in the past loved the customer service they provide) at least I didn't have to pay for this experience. There are so many other hotels right here, I suggest avoiding this Hilton at all costs.

"We stayed at this Courtyard in Oct. 2007, and booked well in advance of our arrival. We used marriott.com to book the room, and reserved a room with two double beds and a balcony (the website lists details about each room type available).Upon arriving at the hotel, the front desk clerk (only one for a line of 5 parties checking-in) advised us that our room was XYZ. When I asked if the room had a balcony and two beds, he said that there were no rooms of that type left. We had a dialogue back and forth, and I said that I reserved a room with a balcony and two beds, and that's what I wanted to get, or else I would go to the Hilton Garden Inn, where I am a Hilton Silver member and spend about 50 less per night. The clerk pulled up the hotel web site and tried to insist to me that a specific room type is not guaranteed rather, they are just guidelines. However, I made it very clear that each available room type listed amenities specific to that room (i.e. double balcony room, XYZ square feet, balcony XYZ square feet, etc.). He was very insistent and offended me with his refusal to admit that, in this case, I was right. To make a long story short, the clerk accomodated us with a one queen bed plus sofabed room with a balcony. The importance of the balcony was because my friend smokes and the entire hotel is smoke-free otherwise. Why the clerk had not suggested this prior to our 15 minute debate is beyond me. Not a good start to this stay.On to the hotel property and facilities. There is plenty of parking. Even with the Mountain Dew/X games convention staying there, there was plenty of parking available, even late at night,. The hotel facilities are relatively new, with lots of bright light and marble. Rooms are decorated nicely, but are average in size. The bed was very comfortable I was told the sofa bed was not that comortable (to be expected, I guess). The balcony was definitely a good size, but overlooked the gas station next door. The bathroom was small, but had good water pressure and a massaging shower head.With regards to the Courtyard's location, I would not say it is unsafe. It is located in downtown Orlando. If you are intimidated by being in a city, then you will most likely be intimidated by the hotel's location. However, there is no need to worry about running into trouble in this part of the city. Simply follow normal night time procedures for being aware of your surroundings, as you should anywhere after dark. The biggest complaint I had about this stay was the noise level. Due to there being tons of teenagers staying here with the previously mentioned convention, we heard yelling and skateboarding in the parking lot at all hours of the night. We also heard other guests yelling out their sliding doors for them to shut up, and arguments ensued. This was around 4-5am. Hotel staff, where were you Someone needed to get this rediculous noise under control. The walls here are very thin, and banging could be heard on adjacent floors of the hotel.The air conditioner in our room would not cool adequately. Even on the high cool setting, it would turn off at about 72 degrees I would say. So after spending the day in the 90+ degree heat, we couldn't get cooled down well enough. And at night it was rather warm. Not to mention that the A/C could not drown out all the noise, because it was off most of the time. There is no constant cool option to override the auto thermostat temp feature of the A/C. Both low cool and high cool switch on and off based on the temp you select. So overall, I was not impressed by the service or general atmosphere of this Courtyard. I have stayed at Hampton Inns that are much nicer, with better customer service. This stay confirmed for me why I frequent Hiltons and their sister properties as opposed to Marriotts. I would not recommend this hotel based on my stay. There are many other fine hotels of this caliber in Orlando, so do yourself a favor and stay at one of the them.",Bad
I have stayed at days inn in the past this was the worst stay I have ever had I am disabled my friends were to stay close by to help me that is the way the rooms were rented that is not what happened they were put upstairs no air conditioner no phone hook up and maintence said what do you want for 40 dollars the worst stay I ever had the front desk girl 2nd shift very rude not acceptable,Bad
"Illegal activity going on the parking lot when we arrived. There was women standing next to motels doors waiting to be served or get served no working vending machines for a soft drink. Black mold growing in the ceiling of our room. The room stunk terribly. There were holes all in the walls and they were patched with thin metal plates. My husband stepped on something and come to find out, it was an extention cord running underneath the carpet, from the out side to the air conditioner inside. We wedged two chairs next to the door because it would not shut properly. The shower head was about to fall out. We felt gross even after a bath. We slept fully dressed because I didn't want any of body parts touching the bed.",Bad
"We stayed at the Hyatt House because it was convenient to the EMP, as we were taking a vocal workshop. The room had greasy fingerprints all over the microwave, chairs around the bar were askew, and the shower was dirty with large spots of soap scum all over it. We called the front desk and they asked if they could clean it the next day! We said, no, we are checking out then and want to take a shower in the morning. They said they would send someone up. I pulled back the covers on the bed to make sure the sheets had been changed and there was a plastic wrapper and a dirty wash rag. Needless to say, we went downstairs and said, please put us in another room. The next room was not very clean either, but better than the first one.kimbrleedo,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns.

The room was tiny and there was nowhere to sit in the room except for the beds and 2 small chairs. One chair had a cigarette burn on it and the other chair had a stain that looked like skid marks.

"You just have to read some of the other reviews for this place to realize that there are some major shortcomings in its management. Clearly not indicative of the Westin brand. We made the mistake of not researching the hotel before making a parking reservation after Christmas. Cutting to the chase, our car was broken into in the garage while we were away (as was the car parked next door). We arrived back late at night to find plastic taped over the window and glass everywhere. The security guard at the hotel showed us a police report and told us that two suspects were arrested, gave us the name and number of the GM and sent us on our way. It is now March - our calls to the GM have never been returned - voicemail every time. 297 out of pocket for replacing the glass in the passenger window plus the cost of items stolen, but we don't have a copy of the police report to pass along to our insurance agent because the hotel management appear not to give two craps about a) what happens at this property, and b) basic customer service. Do yourself a favor and find an alternative.On behalf of the hotel we apologize for the unfortunate incident with your car. You can obtain a copy of the police report by contacting the College Park Police Department at 404-761-3131.",Bad

"We were delayed on our flight back to the UK by 6 hours and decided to book into a motel to wait. Days Inn was first we found and under 50 for a night. So v. cheap with free Wi-Fi and coffee machine. However, the lift was not confidence inspiring and creaked and crashed, the room was not as clean as it may be, we were pleased not to get in the beds and the general environment felt a bit rough/unsafe. We were fine though and had no real issues. Free Wi-Fi dropped constantly and the a/c would not stay on - kept cutting out. I would not stay overnight or at least not more than night and would only do so as a single traveller. Not quite an avoid but go with eyes open.",Bad

"The rate was good, but I'd have paid more for a room that did not have patio doors whistling wind through them and a TV and remote that worked properly. Planned power outage during an entire night was acceptable and hotel did decent job of giving out flashlights and glowsticks, but did not tell us hot water would off in the morning. Restaurant did not honor breakfast vouchers toward an off the menu option even though value of breakfast buffet was listed on coupon. Excellent bed - one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on in a hotel recently. Also, great location near little Italy - lots of fun restaurants and bars.Thank you for reviewing your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn. Please accept our apologies for any confusion about the breakfast and the TV remote difficulty. Our vouchers do not list a price or value because we give the buffet for free and specialty items from the menu are at an additional cost so we invite you to contact us directly to address your concerns. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the cities electric company SDGE shutting the power down while they were making enhancements in the area. We are pleased you felt out bed is one of the most comfortable you have slept in and that you enjoyed the location.",Bad
"They'll charge you a mandatory 20 fee/night for 2 bottles of water, gym access and wine at HH. This was complimentary a few months ago before the renovation. Speaking of which, the hotel lost its charm entirely. The rooms used to be colorful and unique...now they're brown and black just like any big chain hotels Hilton or Omni. Would NOT come back.Dear sfnicole22,Thank you for taking the time to share your honest review.We are deeply saddened to hear we failed to meet your expectations, particularly with regards to our new look.Is is most disappointing to learn your experience was marred by the Urban Amenity Fee.

"Hi, my family and I were having a vacation at Walt Disney World so I decided to stay in Baymont Hotel only for it's photos that can be found online because there was a lot of hotels with the same price per night in the city. First, there was a misunderstanding of the people that made my reservation that were more focused in grabbing your money out of your pocket than helping and listening to the guest. They were pushing me so hard to reserve a room instantly that they did not hear when I said 2 nights. When I got to the hotel, The front desk agent helped me to get another night that wasn't in the reservation. The hotel was nothing to do with the online photos. The carpet was old, stained, dusty, and had bad odors the Lobby was dark. When I got to the room It was disappointed. The whole room stink, the carpet was all dirty and stained. The furniture old and scratched. Bathroom with hair in the floor, towels with holes. Beds were full size not queen. Pillows small and flat. Also I visited the pool which was dirty and with tree leafs in the bottom. I took breakfast in the morning it was small, No eggs, sausage, bacon, milk, only a basic breakfast. What I did like was the quietly of the room the friendly staff, nothing else. I will not come back again to this hotel, and I can not recommend it to anybody. Sorry, that's the very true. Sincerely Mr. Morales ( Security Manager of MIA Hotel)Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your constructive feedback. Our intent is to give great quality at minimal cost to you our valued guest. We ask that you please bare with us as we continue to improve the quality of our hotel while we are undergoing renovations.

"The biggest problem of this hotel is the location, the hotel itself is not that bad. It is clean in general, rooms are very tiny, it doesn't have a fridge and microwave. So basically that's a fine place to sleep, have shower and not more than this. So, If you plan just to sleep in that hotel several nights, it is fine. The hotel can't be blamed, that the district is full of homeless, hookers, drug dealers and junk. However, that district it still in historical part of the city and very close to the Market St and the tram lines.",Bad

"I've stayed at Days Inn's before in other cities and another location in Orlando, and although they are not the most luxurious hotel's around, they are adequate and easy places to stay - except this one!I just checked out this morning after being there 3 days. The main problem was with checking in. Several weeks before, I booked my stay on-line at their web site, choosing a pool-side room with 2 double-beds for a price I had to pre-pay for in advance. When I checked in, they gave me a room with 2 double-beds, but not pool-side. Instead they gave me a room on the top floor of their tower, which was literally the farthest room away from the front desk. When I said I reserved a pool-side room, I was told they didn't have any. When I showed them my reservation that I printed on my computer printer after I made the reservation on-line, the male clerk working that evening (the manager) said, That's not guaranteed. WHAT When I was making the reservation on-line, you are given about 12-15 different choices of rooms to choose from, depending on type and number of beds, amenities, etc. If a room isn't guaranteed, then why is a guest given all these choices to choose from Also, if the room is pre-paid for in advance, doesn't that lock in a guaranteeThis is just the first of all the domino's that began to fall when I was checking in. With my luggage, I walked up the 5 flight's of stairs to the room they gave me to find out the key wouldn't open the lock (magnetic key card). I walked back down first put my luggage back in the car before going back to the front desk telling them the key wouldn't open the door. They called for a Maintenance person to walk up with me to the room and he tried to open the door with his master key. It wouldn't unlock. He continued to try for about 3 minutes when it finally opened, then said to me There you go. But then I asked him if I go out tonight, I don't want to stand there for 3 minutes trying to open this door, at which he replied that he would be back in the morning to fix it. As he walked away, I entered the room and almost keeled-over from the smell in it. No kidding! It smelled as though someone had deficated human feces everywhere in the room. In addition, the lights were already on, the beds were unkept, and the TV was playing. I quickly ran out and yelled at the Maintenance guy to come back. When he entered the room, he looked surprised and went to the phone to apparently call the front-desk. At this point, I was livid! I stormed out of the room, ran down to the front desk, and in front of everyone in the lobby pointed at the male clerk behind the desk and sternly said, I want the pool-side room I reserved and I want it now! He yelled back We dont have any! I don't care for your attitude with me and I'll call the cops and have you thrown out for trespassing. Then you can sleep on the street tonight! At that, I said, Fine, and picked up my cell phone to call Days Inn's 800 number with the intention of getting someone of authority higher up than this guy to fix this situation. Possibly feeling threatened, the male clerk and a female clerk pulled out a large notebook and began looking frantically through it. When I reached a human voice on the Days Inn 800 line, the male clerk said he had a room on the 2nd floor with a king bed and asked if that would be OK with me. I told the person on the phone I may be calling back then hung up. I told the male clerk that I would look at it and let him know. He made up 2 keys, I went to look at the room, then returned to the front desk to tell him that it would be acceptable. After I settled into the room, I returned to the front desk and told the male clerk I was sorry for my outburst, but that I was within my right for it because of the problems that occured. I didn't catch every word the clerk said after that, but it sounded something like You don't know what's going on around here so there was no need to act like that, which told me there may be some sort of internal, political employee problems at this hotel - but that's still no excuse for the problems I enxcountered as a guest of this hotel.When I checked out this morning, the female clerk who took care of it asked me timidly Are you still mad at us She told me she was working the night I checked in and saw everything that happened. I answered her Yeah - a little bit, and she only said she hoped I would consider returning again sometime in the future. Maybe - if they gutted the place, did a complete remodeling job and hired all new, respondible hotel staff.",Bad

"I would avoid this hotel. Bad customer service. I left a device in the TV to charge and it is now gone. I called the hotel after I returned home and explained the situation and they mentioned they would get back right in touch with me. NEver happened. I emailed the manager twice and no response. So I went through Hilton to try and get a response knowing full well that the device is gone. They could not get a response from the hotel either. I was credited the amount of my stay, but unfortunately my device was worth more. Miraculously I got a call from the hotel the day after Hilton tried to contact them and after a few exchanges they said what i already knew - they could not find it.We are committed to delivering outstanding service and what you described in your review was disheartening to all of us.

"The room was a great size, updated and nice. The shower/tub was dirty, and the pool area was nasty, The kids wanted to swim ( which is why we booked this hotel... for its indoor pool) , but the pool was nasty and the hot tub had what looked like sand all in the bottom of it.

"I stayed at this hotel a month ago, and I got it on Hotels.com with a coupon. When I arrived, the night clerk was not too friendly, but was fast in completing the check-in process. The room was on the ground level, and had some noisy people walking past it throughout the night. On the good side, the bed and pillows were clean and comfortable, and the were plenty of lightning options in the room. I got a good night's rest. It also had a flat-screen TV, but I didn't watch it, so I can't comment on whether it worked or not. On the bad side, the shower did not have any hot water, and the sink faucet did not produce any water at all. So I had to take a cold shower and had to wash my hands, brush my teeth, etc. by turning on the water faucet in the bathtub and washing in my hands and moistening my toothbrush in the resulting flow of water. There were also none of the freebies you expect at a hotel, like toothpaste. Another downfall was that hard to step in and out of because the outer wall was high. I almost slipped when I got out of the shower.The morning clerk was friendly and completed the check-out process quickly. Overall, I would only stay here for a night at most. And ask for a room with running water in the sink and hot water in the shower.",Bad
"I booked a room here through a booking site. Apparently the price they gave was wrong and the manager made sure I understood that he was doing me the biggest favour in the world by letting me pay the quoted price: 'I could have cancelled it, you know', is what he said. He then gave me a room with a broken lock and no key, so every time I had to go out, I had to explain this all over again to whoever was at reception, and who would then go up VERY reluctantly to unlock the door for me. The people next door to me were a bunch of intimidating men watching sports on tv and shouting all night, and wrecking their room (from what I could see from the open door when I walked by there the next morning). Some of the furniture in my room was broken. The breakfast is not worth mentioning (dry bagels, bad coffee). The lady at reception the next morning was much nicer and helpful.",Bad
"I have written almost 150 reviews on Trip Advisor almost all of which were rated Very Good or Excellent. I am not a chronic complainer, but this is one of my rare negative reviews.I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Old Town for 2 nights on November 8th and 9th. My stay started out very positive, but ended on a negative note.First, the positives:Its a great location is the heart of Old Town San Diego. The hotel has a great restaurant on site Old Town Tequila Factory which I rated favorably. Dozens of other restaurants and shops are within a short walk.The Old Town Transit Center is also a few blocks away. There, you can hop on the Trolley to go to Downtown, Qualcomm Stadium and the Mission Valley shopping malls.The negatives:This location charges for parking -- 15 per day (10 for AAA members). This is also one of the few Best Westerns which doesnt offer a free breakfast (AAA members get a 25 discount off their breakfast buffet).My biggest complaint is that I didnt receive any housekeeping service on Monday. When I complained to the Front Desk on Tuesday, they made matters worse.I was traveling on vacation and wanted to sleep later on Monday morning, so I put out my Do Not Disturb sign. I removed the DND sign at 10am Monday when I left for the day. I returned to my room after the football game at 10:30pm to discover that my room was never cleaned.When I mentioned this Tuesday morning, the Front Desk clerk turned the problem around and basically said that it was MY fault that my room wasnt cleaned. I should have called Housekeeping to request service.I have worked in a hotel for 25 years, so I know thats not the way it works. If there is a DND on the door in the morning, Housekeeping returns after lunch to recheck the room. Clearly, this wasnt done.I am not the type of guest who expects a free stay for any minor problem, but I do think it would be appropriate to receive some compensation for my inconvenience of returning to a dirty room.The price I paid for the room includes the cost of providing housekeeping services. If the hotel fails to provide a promised service, they should not charge for it.I have requested that the hotel issue me a refund for the 20 parking fees which would be 10 discount off my total bill. I think that this would be fair and appropriate amount for returning to a dirty room.The Front Desk Manager has admitted that they made a mistake, but the hotel is refusing to issue a refund or any form of compensation for my inconvenience. In light of this poor customer service, I have given the hotel a Poor rating.Thank you for your feedback. As a result of your review, we have revisited our procedures in order to make the changes needed. I apologize for the housekeeping oversight. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if another stay in Old Town is on your agenda so that I can assign a team member to personalize your experience. Happy Holidays!",Bad

"This is my first tripadvisor review and I feel I need to share my experience. The hotel and room is renovated and modern but we were assigned to an accessible room on first night which layout made us feel uncomfortable. They changed to a standard room for us next day but that room was not cleaned yet after we came back from the beach at 8pm and they wanted us to wait 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned because they did not have other room available. The guy (I forgot his name but he made me feel like lacks of experience) at front desk kept justifying it is their system issue (which means ok for customer). Even after room cleaned, we found hair on the bed and pillow smells and they only put 1 glass in our room. I choose Hyatt Centric because of their location, modern design and the quality of Hyatt (used to be), but this experience made me disappointed. Their staff definitely needs more training.Hi Brian C,Thank you for sharing your review of your stay with us in Waikiki. We apologize for the inconvenience with your room assignment.

"Hotel Diva tries to position itself as trendy and chic. In reality, it is way over-priced and of very poor quality: small, very noisy rooms cheap, broken furniture terrible TV reception erratic water temperature in the shower. Only positives were good check in and check out.I stayed in room 620, facing Geary Street, on 6th of 7 floors. The traffic noise was absolutely horrendous and deafening. Also, there was a door to an adjoining room that looked of normal thickness but must be hollow as I could hear every word that the people in the next room said or watched on TV. Also, whenever the HVAC unit came on I had to adjust the TV volume, probably more due to the smallness of the room than anything else. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the hotel provides you with ear plugs along with your shampoo, etc. You will not be able to sleep without the ear plugs.The bathroom is slightly bigger than a closet, with no room or shelves to put your stuff. I took a shower at 5am and the water temperature constantly fluctuated between hot and cold.The furniture is uncomfortable and cheap- the chair for the desk was broken and is not suitable for working.The TV reception is awful - very grainy and only analog. No digital. You do get free wi-fi. Wow.Stay away from this place. I went there via the secret hotel option on Travelocity - the hotel calls itself 3 1/2 stars. It's far from that.Dear Patrick H,Thank you for sharing your comments with Trip Advisor. Please accept my sincere apology for the inconvenience you experienced during your recent stay with us. I always encourage my guests to communicate to myself and my staff any concerns they may have during their stay.

She wanted to know with whom I spoke. I did not take the young ladies name. Where I come from when someone tells you they will do something they are suppose to do it! They had given away our room and we had to settle for Queen Non-Smoking. They had no explanation or common courtesy to offer for their mistake. This hotel was absolutely Filthy. It smelled terrible. Every corridor reeked of air freshener trying to cover up the unpleasant odors. They do not maintain anything. The lobby, corridor, and elevator was so bad that I actually dreaded going into the room. Every inch of floor was covered with something that needed swept, mopped, or vacuumed. The room ceiling had huge water stains, curtains had some huge black mystery stain on them. The carpet was sticky. The bathroom floor was slippery with God only knows what. The room did not smell fresh at all. The fabric furniture had huge stains all over it. It was so bad I was afraid to put my clothes or belongings anywhere. I ended up removing the comforter and laying it over the sofa so we could put our things down. I did not remove my socks in the room my entire stay. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The bedding was old, tabby, and scratchy. The pillows were like rough paper. The kitchen was dirty the sink had gunk in the bottom. Floors were not swept well. The A/C unit was so loud it was like a piece of machinery was in the room with us. The person above us stomped their floor all night. You can hear everything through the walls inside. You can also hear everything from the outside of the hotel as well. Very old building that needs an absolute demolition and remodel inside. I have stayed in many hotels in my time, but this one was absolutely disgusting. Then the next morning when we were ready to get the heck outta there the front lobby attendant informed my husband that he needed to pay more for the room. She refused to check us out until my husband paid her. She claimed we had been put in the wrong room. Yes thanks to them we had! Because they gave away our room! We had already paid for our room through priceline. The transaction was complete. She wanted my husband to give her a receipt from the previous afternoon when we checked in. They didn't give us anything at that time. She wanted to know who checked us in so she could scold them. Guess what SHE DID! She would not look at the booking in her system and flat out accused my husband of lying about the fact that he paid through priceline. She told him she couldn't take his word for it. Okay fine, then look into your own computer system the information is there! He had to call me inside from our car and I literally had to pull up the priceline information that she refused to look for herself on her computer from my phone. She was trying to charge us 99.00 dollars inclusive of tax for a room we had already paid for. She still argued with my husband and refused to speak to him directly. She kept yelling the same thing asking who checked us in. Again SHE DID! She was the rudest front desk attendant I have ever dealt with. Finally after she was satisfied with the receipt on my phone, she still held us there so she could call their own help line to fix the problem. She finally let us go and never gave us our receipt from them. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I don't suggest you do either.",Bad
"First off, even with my credit card number, they would not hold the room past 8 PM! Old funky room, fairly clean except for overlayed cigarette stink, cig ashes on the coffee tray, cobwebs in the bathroom, smoke detector removed very little sound proofing between rooms, but that was OK because we had the A/C roaring all night to deal...

"I have been in multiple Days Inn properties and I like them. This one is not among them. I picked this one as of proximity of my meeting location - I now wish I should have choose something else.Confusing floor plan spread across 2 different buildings. Hanging stuff in bathroom, you cant understand weather you have open or shut a tap. Either you get too cold water or too hot water. No breakfast at all - there is buffet you can pay but that is just OK. Inconsistent WiFi and bad room lightning. Staff are good - but they are overloaded. Hence very little time for checking with you.",Bad
"Unfortunately was a somewhat terrible stay. Right from the get go was warned that the systems were down and would have them up again soon. Was told about other amenities and directed to the room. Come to find out walking by the pool that that was out of order as well. With no wifi since their systems were down I headed to the bar and got a bite a drink. I think everyone was there since no one could get wifi or go to the pool and everyone charging their rooms. The next day at our tradeshow event the wifi was still in and out and their systems were still down. Overall pretty disappointing experience with all of the amenities unavailable. Hopefully they figure it out!Thank you for your feedback, and we apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. Unfortunately, Marriott did have a system outage caused by the hurricane that affected several hundred properties during your stay. We worked very quickly to resolve the issue, though, and our system was back up in less than 24 hours. We truly value your business and hope that you'll give us another try in the future. Thank you for choosing Marriott!",Bad

"LOOK.. i have stayed in many places:This place is the WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER STAYED IN.IF you are a basic backpacker that does not care whatsoever about elemental hygene, and are planning to be absolutley drunk whilst here..then I recommend this place. However, if you are a normal human being and expect clean sheets, and not pubes stuck to walls and absolutley filthy carpet that trust me you can SMELL has NEVER BEEN CLEANED..and just a HORRID room full of bed bugs, then you will not want to stay here. Dont spend your money here. The people running this place would NEVER pass a health inspection..absolutley never. And i will be complaining. Because since I have been back I have had rashes all over my body. I just cant believe that people can get away with a place like this.try other hostels, we saw other nice ones whilst there. The bathrooms have full hairs in sink, and half eaten food everywhere..it was just a nightmare. ANY place should at least have clean sheets and not sheets filled with stains, and all different old sheets that had never been washed. A complete disguiting example of a hostel. Apalled. Oh and if you see good reviews..TRUST me its because the writers are proably backpackers (that are prob 16 and have never left home) and were absiolutley drunk and looking to party and they stayed here because they got free beer. BIG excitement..beer is like 5 bucks..go buy some and stay somwhere descent. Thats all",Bad
"Same hotel, same great location, same great bed and incredibly comfortable pillows. So how can the review of my second stay here drop down to one star after previously according this hotel five stars on my other visit Easy, room service, or better stated, lack thereof. We were there for three nights. On our second day, we headed out early and knowing we were going to be gone for at least several hours, we thought it would be an opportune time for them to clean our room and make the bed. Upon our return and to our dismay, the room had not yet been made up. But we figured, no biggie, they can do so once we head out to dinner. And they did indeed do the job. The next day, the same thing. We headed out for a few hours and asked them to once again make up the room while we were out. We even gently reminded housekeeping of what happened the previous day, and they assured us the room would be done by the time we returned. Well, once again, when we returned, nothing had been done. Not being too happy, we spoke with the housekeeping supervisor and explained the situation. She apologized and said they'd get right on it, so we headed out to have some fun (always something to do in this town). But yet again, after we returned, the room still was unmade. We went downstairs and firmly, but nicely complained to the desk clerk about our situation. She said that someone would be sent up promptly, so we headed to a bar and killed about an hour and a half. Upon returning, almost incredibly so, the room was still not made up. By now we were extremely frustrated, so I called down and asked to speak with the on-site manager. I explained everything to him, expressing our frustration and feeling that our requests were blatantly disregarded. He assured me that the room would be cleaned immediately and even deducted 100 off our bill. Well, the room was finally cleaned and yes, our bill was reduced by 100, but the bad taste hasn't left my mouth. This was horrible customer service and be rest assured we will not stay here again.Thank you simiseeu for taking the time to provide your feedback on your recent stay with us. As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay.

"We arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. We were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. We took the shuttle to Pike Place Market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. It still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. We were thrilled with our view of EMP, Space Needle and Chihuly Garden. We had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. We slept 6 fairly comfortably. Twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. In the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. We almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. After dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. They tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. They finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. Sure enough - standard practice. When we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being SO tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. There was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. Very frustrating! On the plus side - breakfast was very good. This place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a Hyatt.Dear JenH,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hyatt house Seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. We will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. Also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. The issues you experience will be addressed. Again I apologize that your stay did not go smoothly as it should have. I hope that you will give us another opportunity the next time you are in town and feel free to contact me directly so I can assist with your next stay personally. Sincerely,Jonathan",Bad

"Days Inn Orlando Fl 5858 international dive by Wet N Wild, 7-11, and Red Lobster.Would pick a better Hotel next time. For starters they advertise to give shuttles to the parks however that shuttle service is one drop off time and a few pick up times. We were going to Universal Studio which opens at 10 but the shuttle doesnt leave until 10:45. The park closes at 8 but the shuttle picks up at 7:15 and 10:15. However Universal studios is in walking distance, so we choice to walk. It took us about 20 minutes to walk along with a wheelchair, so many may be able to walk faster. Also the shuttle require a 24 hour notice for wheelchairs. So since we didnt know exactly when we would need them ahead of time we were not able to use their shuttle.We started in room 275. We let the front desk know that we needed a fridge, as we have meds that have to be kept cold, and they did get us a fridge. The fridge does keep things cold but doesnt seal on top. You can put your finger right into the fridge. So we put a towel on top to help keep things out and the fridge cold. Fridges and Microwaves are available for an extra 10 charge. However, the next day, we found some uninvited bugs in our room. Not the end of world but I really am bug-a-phobic. I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to spray while we were out. When we got back they had the fan on in the bathroom and we didnt see anything.. But the next morning we I had to turn the light on for the bathroom we found more. We quickly got dress as we kept finding more and my husband went to speak the manager. We were asked to wait a half hour for the manager to come in. Half hour later, the manager was in a meeting so my husband told the front desk lady the issues. They called in a contractor to spray and moved us to room 105. The new room was much bigger and nicer looking. Plus it had a table and two chairs which was not in the other room.The door to room 275 didnt really seal at all. You could see the light from outside and pizza places where putting ads/coupons in the door frames. The ads would come right through the right side of the door and fall to floor a few feet in. In room 105 the door sealed better but there were people outside smoking and talking and you could totally hear them plus smell their smoking in the room. At least the ads got stuck in the door. Everything went ok after that except for toilet overflowing once. My husband quickly shut off the water to the toilet and we put down towels on the floor. I called the front desk and a lady came down to our room and asked what was wrong, although I explained it over the phone. They sent down the maintenance guy who just fixed the toilet. My husband asked if it was going to get cleaned up and we were told yes but that is housekeepings job. 15 minutes later we recalled the front desk and asked if someone was going to clean up the mess and bring us new towels. We had used towel to clean up the water. Housekeeping was around shortly after to cleanup and put in new towels. Other issue with the room beside it being run down was hearing everything that was going on outside.The hotel does not have a continental breakfast but they told us there is a Deli but we just went to Wal-Mart for quick breakfast foods. There is also 7-11 two spots down and Dennys and I-Hop are across the street.The interest is also issues at this hotel. There is Wi-Fi here but often the internet will not work. I know the issue is not my computer as my laptop is running just fine. I took the downtime to do extra maintenance work and write start to write this review.Our children did try the pool but shortly came back because they said it was cold and not that clean.. However it was a windy day so that may be why. Over all about a two star hotel which does have some issues but they are in the perfect location with Wet n Wild being about a block, Universal Studios in walking distance, and the I-trolley stop for SeaWorld and anything else on international drive as one the trolley I-ride stop is just across the street. For me I would rather stay at one of the nicer hotels, which seem to be closer to SeaWorld as the ones on the south side of International Drive look a bit older and run down.",Bad

"Stayed in December . Location is good close to french quarter and aquarium etc. Front desk staff friendly . Room was not good the bathroom was old and poorly maintained, water pressure very bad and shower not that hot, power points came away from the wall when removing dryer etc. The floor above us was very noisy and we could hear footsteps all night , very loud. Room included croissants for breakfast that we're okay but coffee was only warm . Our room also had a safe that didn't work which is a huge pain. We had to drop valuables at the front desk ever time we went out... The phone in our room also continuously flashed a red message light which is actually quite bright at night... We were told it was faulty ( like the safe) . We would think there are better hotels available. We went to bourbon st on Christmas night and found it to be fine .... Pretty quiet but we left by 9 , so can't comment on excessive drinkers etc. it was quiet for obvious reasons.

"My family and I checked in on Thursday 9/21 around 9pm. The parking lot was very small and hard to get a spot. When we finally got in the lobby, it looked clean and presentable. Our room was an entirely different story. It was facing outside by the pool. The light was already on in our room before we entered. Once we got in I was immediately disgusted. It smelled horrible (almost like a really bad sulfur), room looked very outdated and unappealing. Room was small, beds were old and I was so grossed out. I went to the front desk and explained how disappointed I was and they let me look at a few other rooms they offered--all of them terrible. We stayed put as there was no sense in moving to another awful room and quickly went to bed. When I woke up the next morning there were TWO cockroaches in the bathroom. YUCK! Southern California, I get it, bugs can happen. Every other hotel we stayed at for the rest of the week was so lovely. Very clean, up to date, and well kept. We had a few other family members that stayed in different rooms at this hotel and they were all equally displeased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. It ran me 135 after 12 for parking. We had 3 more rooms reserved at this hotel again for that Sunday but we canceled them immediately. Gross, outdated, smelly, and OVERPRICED. Never again will I stay at this hotel! BUYER BEWARE. Also, when I checked out of the hotel, the man at the desk asked me how everything was. I told him You don't want to know and the didn't have any response...not a sorry, to hear that, nothing..Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

"My husband and I stayed at Estancia over the Thanksgiving weekend. Thank goodness for our Thanksgiving dinner at Torrey Pines (where we'll be staying next time), or the weekend would have been a complete loss.Noise: The builders sure made a lot of money on this one, because the walls must be made of cardboard. You can hear your neighbors above and on the sides, you can hear everyone in the hallway (even when not directly outside your door), and you can hear TVs, heating and a/c from all adjoining rooms as they rumble through your room and ripple through your ceiling and walls. If you must stay here, insist on a top floor room (3rd Floor, I believe) to minimize overhead noise.Room Size: Hardly the square footage promoted (300 sq ft). You practically bang your knees on the armoire (TV set holder) as you pass by the foot of the bed. The hallway is a total waste, and the patio is a joke.Room Furnishings: There was a huge stain on the lampshade there was no lamp or light provided in the area of the suitcase dolly, so you rummaged in your bag in the dark. The TV was so very small and made a huge buzzing sound if it was muted. No regular blankets were provided, just sweat making, hot acrylic ones. Only 3 towels and 3 pillows were provided for 2 people. The bathroom light could only be turned on with the fan, which was so loud (I mean really loud) that a relaxing bath was impossible unless you wanted to bathe in the dark.Dining: In the restaurant, we asked what time dinner was served. We were told half an hour. In the bar, we ordered a drink in the bar. It never arrived. We went back to the restaurant half an hour later. We were told dinner wasn't being served for another half hour. Having already been given incorrect information once, we checked with a third restaurant employee who told us that dinner was not for another hour. Two wrong answers and an undelivered drink - that's how we ended up at the Lodge at Torrey Pines.Pool/Jacuzzi: The area was a mess, there were no towels, and there was no one from whom to get towels.Just Plain Tacky: The 17 parking charge, the 9 Hospitality Fee.Save your money for any other resort or hotel.

"Hotel was only worth the 50 that we paid through Priceline. The agent that checked us in was rude and didn't want to be bothered. We were in town for the USC/ Alabama game and flew in early Saturday, due to our schedules. We arrived at the hotel at 9am, requested early check in, the agent didn't even look down and said Check in wasn't till 3p I asked if we were able to get an early check in to the reply we can try for 2p at the earliest she didn't even look down at the computer to see if a room was available. After asking if anything was open now, she was able to find an available room. I have worked in hotels for 10 years, and know that rooms are open if you don't sell out the night before which they didn't. Since our flight was early that morning we decided to rest before heading to the stadium, only to be woken by the housekeeper wanting to inspect the room. Hotel in general is dark and gloomy, halls feel cold and hotel looks like a bad 80s hotel. Watch out for platform bed edges at night, I have a huge bruise due to running into the corner when getting up in the middle of the night. Do yourself a favor and pass up this hotel and spend the money on something nicer.Thank you for your most recent stay. We take great pride providing the highest level of service, guest safety and cleanliness. As you know from working in hotels, we can never guarantee an early check in but will do our best in our attempts to make accommodations for guests wanting to check in early. With that in mind, while we may not have sold every room the night before, reservations are often made for specific room types for a reason and we may have not had your specific room type available at such an early hour as checkout is not until 12 PM. We were indeed sold out for the weekend of the game and our team did their best to get the rooms turned as quickly as possible. Hopefully we will see you again for the next game.",Bad

"Wanted to do Park and Fly but they wanted 11 a day for Parking which we thought was very excessive. I was grossed out by the sheets, there were yellow spots on them. Room dark and dingy. People at front counter very abrupt, borderline rude. Won't be staying at this Super 8 ever again.",Bad
"I booked at hotels.com for a quick overnight trip for our nephew's graduation. The inn touted itself as a European boutique hotel, but it's really a step up from a hostel. Bare bones. We paid half the fee charged on their website for a double room. Double means just that: double beds. When I called to confirm the day before our trip, I got no answer, so I emailed. The reply from the front desk staff was condescending and rude, and immediately I regretted booking at the Highland Inn. I then discovered that others have complained (if you want link, let me know). It was too late to cancel, so I arrived with trepidation. The room was spartan, the shower was awful, the a/c window units were not very effective, the carpet was old, the fridge was banged up, and the breakfast was paltry. However, the neighborhood was cute (my local relative said it was not that good but I couldn't tell from our brief stay) and it's close to historic midtown (2 miles). The management never contacted me re the rude reception, and my final recommendation is to go somewhere else.Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We take all feedback seriously, and sincerely regret that you did not have a positive experience with us. Currently, we are replacing the window units throughout the hotel with individual heating/cooling units, however, if your unit was not working efficiently we would have been happy to move you and the same goes for the shower. Any time you are not happy with anything during your stay, we are more than happy to help. Upon further investigation, I am having trouble locating the email you spoke of, and it certainly is not in keeping with how we treat our guests. We urge you to contact us directly to discuss. We strive to make our guests stay the best it can be and would be more than happy to address this situation with our staff. Thank you,Kristin Anderson",Bad
"Hotel literally on route 35..translation. .hwy noise all night.Hotel location central to a lot of things.Hotel not maintained. Not clean. No reinvestment in hotel updates. Kitchen chairs all ripped up. Need replacing. Room furniture terrible , embarrassing shape. Afraid to sit in. Courtyard is embarrassing.

"I stayed one night recently in the annex. Sounds like the luxe part of the hotel overlooking the coast is a better bet. Being unfamiliar with the hotel, I was not aware of this. The annex is like a motel. The room was dingy and in need of a good cleaning and some fresh paint. Overall, it just made me feel itchy. The kid at the front desk was a bit snarky, but efficient. Otherwise, valet was fine and I didn't interact much with any other staff to offer comment. I stayed in a suite the Borgata the night before, so admittedly most AC options would've been a letdown. In hindsight I wish I would've just ponied up the money and stayed the Borgata another night. My bad, I guess.",Bad
"This hotel is horrible for so many reasons that I don't even know where to begin. The location is on a very busy street called Orange Blossom Trail. When we arrived, we needed to make a left turn in order to get to the parking lot of the Hotel. Making that left turn seemed nearly impossible and very dangerous! The traffic on Orange Blossom makes getting in and out of the parking lot seemingly impossible and we almost had an accident! We checked into room 284...on the 2nd floor and had tons of luggage because we were in town for a Fashion Show. Low and behold, the hotel has NO elevators! What!! How do you operate a hotel that has a second floor with no elevators The guy at the front desk almost laughed out loud when he told us there were no elevators...not because it was funny but because he too, thought it was ridiculous! We had to lug heavy bags up the stairs only to get there and find that the room was horrible. There was a musty moisture in the air as soon as we walked in and the room felt very stale and unclean. The walls had been caulked to fill in several holes and I do mean SEVERAL HOLES but they didn't even attempt to match the paint. The wall was painted yellow but the caulked portion was painted over with orange. The sheets and comforters on both beds had yellow stains and brown stains all over. The carpet was stained, possibly with urine because it smelled heavy with urine near the stain. The bathroom looked very old and cheaply constructed with peeling paint and stained walls. The hotel was pet friendly but I don't think they spray regularly for fleas because we all had flea bites after only being in the room for a few hours. The halls smelled really bad and especially in the stairwells. One huge thing that stood out was that there were several young women, dressed very scantily, walking up and down the street in the area near the hotel in the late evenings. I do believe there was heavy prostitution in the area and this hotel and other hotels in the area are used for that purpose. We decided that we could not sleep comfortably in this hotel and checked out the same night. The weekend that we were in town was a busy weekend due to the All Star event so most hotels were booked solid. We searched and searched and found a hotel with only one room left! We booked it, packed up and high tailed it out of there! Ended up approximately 2 miles away at a Hampton Inn Suites where we re-showered, and slept comfortably in clean beds! Never again will I stay at a Baymont! We booked here for two reason...because the group we were in town for had blocked several hotels for their fashion show and this was one of them and number two, because most hotels in the area were already sold out. I will never stay at a Baymont EVER again!",Bad
We were price gouged on a Saturday night paying over 300 for a one night stay here which wouldn't have been so bad if the room was decent. The hotel staff were terribly unfriendly. We were made to feel as if we were inconveniencing them so we didn't even bother to complain. Our room had it's bathroom window TAPED onto the window frame. Cold air leaked in all night. I would never recommend this place to anyone.,Bad

"First impressions last forever. This was my first time staying at a Marriott hotel. I booked our room months in advance of our arrival date. Arrived at 4:10 p.m. and room was not ready. Took 3 people to confirm the room was NOT ready. Spent 12 mins waiting to get a room. No upgrade was offered or same style room we originally booked was offered. Was given a standard room with a 30.00 discount. The room was OK, however the beds were very small for double occupancy and way too high off the floor! No complementary Internet or coffee was offered. No free breakfast either. Do yourself a favor and book at a Hilton/Hampton hotel. You will get more amenities for a lot less . I could have stayed 2 nights at a Hilton/Hampton for what I paid 1 night for at Marriott.Lilac,Creating a Brilliant Experience is our top priority and we apologize for missing that mark during your stay. I understand how important is to receive the room type requested and have a room ready at the scheduled check in time.

"We booked this hotel months in advance for our upcoming Disneyland vacation carefully taking into consideration all our options of the many comparable hotels in Anaheim. Less than two weeks before our arrival date an email notification came to advise us the pool would be closed for maintenance for the majority of our stay! Now I am aware that this is necessary, however in all of my past experiences any type of scheduled maintenance is clearly disclosed well in advance. Upon a call to the hotel's manager to discuss this concern, no apology or compensation was offered, and she even encouraged us to look into other hotel options! With less than two weeks to go entering a busy season, clearly most hotels are already booked. Very unprofessional and disappointing is my option of this hotel already, and we've not even set foot on the property!",Bad

"We found this hotel online with a discount coupon. Checked out the website and everything looked great...it boasts free shuttle service to Disneyland and Knotts and that it is a mile and a half away from Disneyland. Try about 5 miles. Took forever to find it. It was in this wierd, old part of town, off the beaten path, right on the main drag of Brookhurst street. Outside appearance was a little icky. It had an unattractive closed down restaurant as part of the hotel and an old shuttle that was sitting in the front. To our dismay, there were no longer any shuttle services offered. The rooms were old and a little bit dingy. You can hear people in the other rooms taking showers. The beds were not at all comfortable. TV got only a few stations. Definately not what we expected. We thought it was going to be a classy hotel by Disneyland. We felt slightly misled by the website. The perks The rooms had a microwave and little refridgerator. The pool was nice and secluded, very quiet and clean. My nephew and I swam for 2 hours, all alone! We were the only ones out there, it was great! Friendly staff, willing to help. Overall, this wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I will be much more diligent in the future when I do research for hotels.",Bad
we booked this hotel and they told us we could cancel our reservation 24 hours before the stay.i read the reviews and saw the hotel was bad. So i canceled. They said there was no cancelation policy. So I canceled my credit card. But then I found out that the charge went through.,Bad
"I stayed at this hotel for business when I had to work late one night and needed to stay in the city. I chose this hotel because my company had just had their quarterly meeting here and I thought it was very nice. Check in was easy and everyone was very friendly. I love the dcor. Upon check in I was given a 10 bar card to use either at the bar or from the mini bar. I ordered a salad to go and took it to my room to eat. The room is decorated so cute. I loved it. I had the queen room and it is very small. It was fine for me but might be a bit tight if you had another person. I chose a drink from the mini bar to use my free 10. The next morning I filled out my free drink card and even took down my list of bar items as it said to do upon check to make sure I was credited for the correct item. I was asked if I wanted to use the other part of my 10.00 towards my salad and I said sure, I guess. No problem...finished my check out and headed to work. Today I check my bank account and I have two charges...one for the original amount including the hold, and another for the amount I actually paid when I checked out. When I called and asked why I was charged twice, they said well...instead of refunding you the 3.00 on the salad they did a full refund and full charge. Well guess what, this doesn't work well.....I now have two hotel charges and no refunds, as it takes several days before the refund hits your bank. I could have cared less about the 3.00, especially had I known how much of my bank account it would eat up. Luckily I had it in the bank, but I need it...I don't have a ton of extra money to just tie up an extra 172.00 for a 3.00 refund. I think this is a horrible practice and I certainly should have been told about it upfront. I am not sure if I will stay here again, I do not like to have my money messed with. :( Very disappointed.Ouch! This makes me upset to read. I'm sorry that a great experience turned out to be a disappointment.

"We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.Ms. Sara Z , Let me start this response by apologizing to both of you in regards to the overall experience you had at our hotel, as we can see we failed to meet your basic guest needs. Our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests on Friday Saturday, we failed to provide you with personalized service and attention during your arrival and throughout. We are happy to hear that the upgraded accommodations to our Urban suite was up to your standards. Also regarding the gift bag and wine, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 30 gift bags per day and we have not had this situation happened before, we update our wines every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of the wine during your visit, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience. I am sorry we missed you during your checkout, as our Manager on Duty was available and expecting you.

"I had booked at this hotel for 2 nights. I arrived to check in and was told that there was no reservation in my name (even though I had the confirmation number showing the reservation) and that the hotel was fully booked . The clerk tried blaming it on the booking company and then told me I should have booked through the hotel directly and that it was my fault for using a booking company. However I'm prerty sure the hotel jusy over booked on purpose. She didn't offer me any help at all so my 3 kids and I were stranded in an unfamiliar town with no where to go and a dying cell phone. She didn't offer any apology nor did she offer to call other hotels to help us find a room or offer any kind of information about where to go. Worst customer service ever. Stupidly small parking lot (that does not look safe at all). I would avoid this hotel!!!! We ended up going to a hotel close to this one (Pacific View Inn.....NOT to be confused with the Pacific Shores Inn)....even though that hotel was full too, the man working there took the time to help me out and made some great suggestions. I do apologize for the mistake of my hotel and your reservation. I will stress the importance of taking care of every person, whether a guest or not.

I booked at this hotel in February earlier this year. 3 days before I was to leave for the convention, the hotel emailed me stating they could not honor my reservations, but had moved me to another of their chain hotels some miles away. This was unacceptable due to the convention being in this hotel. I called and talked to management and was told that YES, we did purposely overbook the hotel, and that YES this is Marriott company policy. I was also told I would receive a call from the hotel manager the next day. This did not happen, nor would the initial front end manager answer her phone or return any voice mails. BEWARE, a confirmation number with Marriott means nothing. I am appreciative of the early warning however, as I was able to completely cancel the trip and cut at least some of my expense losses.",Bad

"There were more cons than pros for the 4 nights that my family stayed here. 14 people were on this trip and we rented 3 rooms. Unfortunately, the room that i ended up with had many problems. All 3 rooms were non-smoking room, but right when i walked into the room, you can smell the aroma of cigarettes. The second problem faced was the dysfunctional microwave in the room. We called the front desk to come fix it for us, they were nice enough to come see what was wrong with it and come fix it however, i don't know what they fixed because the microwave did not heat up the food at all. The third, but biggest, problem was the BED BUGS! Even though they might say their hotel is bug free, we faced these little pests late at night. My son was bitten many times(pictures included) and I was bit once on my eyebrow on the last night. Luckily, we caught one bug that was still moving around in the morning and showed them to the front desk. We asked for a discount because all the nights we stayed there were met with discomfort however the best they did for us was a discount for one night. We called the manager and explained our situations after our stay and he wasn't much of a help either.Thank you for expressing your concerns in regards to your recent experience at the Best Western Miramar. The concerns you have raised are very understandable given what you described, and I appreciate the opportunity to look into it and respond.The global resurgence of bed bugs over the last five years is a widely-recognized problem. It is suspected that this resurgence is a direct result of increased international travel to and from the United States, since bed bugs are easily transported in suitcases, clothing, and purses among other things. To address this growing problems, we have a continuous pest control policy in place at our property and have implemented a thorough training program for our housekeeping and maintenance personnel to assist in the early recognition of infestation.Our certified pest control vendor has visited the property and assures us that there is no current infestation on property. Given the nature of our business, it is our expressed commitment to make sure every guest experience an enjoyable one.

"We arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. We were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. We took the shuttle to Pike Place Market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. It still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. We were thrilled with our view of EMP, Space Needle and Chihuly Garden. We had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. We slept 6 fairly comfortably. Twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. In the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. We almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. After dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. They tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. They finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. Sure enough - standard practice. When we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being SO tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. There was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. Very frustrating! On the plus side - breakfast was very good. This place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a Hyatt.Dear JenH,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hyatt house Seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. We will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. Also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. The issues you experience will be addressed.

"Arrived after a long trip. Got to the hotel after 11pm and discovered that even though I had a guaranteed reservation, there was no room waiting for me because they had overbooked the hotel. They walked me to a Fairfield hotel about 8 miles away (great staff but a tad nasty and very worn hotel). I wasn't the only one walked. At least four or five other people had the same experience I did at the same time (and according to the Fairfield clerk--a lot of people have this happen). Maybe this was a lucky break. When I took the Fairfield van back to the Marriott in the early morning for a meeting I had there I discovered, according to one guest, that he had experiencced strange bugs (bedbugs) in his room that night.....so perhaps a golden lining.",Bad
"we arrived at 11 am with confirmation from our booking agent that clearly states an early check in at 9.30am. there was no room for us, but the receptionist did say she would get a cleaner on to a room straight away. we looked around for a seat, there was a sofa that had stains all over it, we choose a table with cereals and other crumbs on it, it was the best table available in there. after an hour of waiting the receptionist lunch was delivered by a local takeaway, which she ate and had a soda to wash it down after 2 hours of waiting and no refreshments offered we were told our room was ready. it was a room that I had seen the cleaner clean when we first arrived, she had cleaned two more since that room but we were kept waiting. it was a strange room, your bathroom had a shower and toilet the sink was in the kitchen area which double up as a kitchen sink. the next day we went to checkout and the same receptionist was working, I went to hand in my key but was kept waiting while she was putting polish on her finger nails, while we waited for her, we spoke to another couple who were sat on the same table we sat the day before, they also had confirmation for an early check in but no room was ready. finally all the receptionist nails were done and she took our key . there was no goodbye, thank you, how was your stay.....nothing. we would not recommend this hotel to anyone. we have even told our travel agent how bad it was and they have said that they just went by the Ramada name brand.....well we wont be staying at that hotel next time we visit san diegoComments from our guests are extremely appreciated as they allow us to better understand how we can improve our accommodations.

"Downtown hotel that was hard to find as entrance/parking garage is around the corner from the actual address. The sign out front is very small. Overnight parking is exhorbitant we used a garage 5 blocks away, although there are others closer by. Room was interesting L shape with view over street. Furnishings were all fine although 2 lightbulbs were burnt out. Staff was helpful, but busy. Pub next door is half the price (or less) than hotel restaurant. I noticed traffic noise, especially truck honking early in morning and siren that went by. Not a poor hotel, just not my style for visiting a city and making everything convenient.We appreciate the feedback jerryg, to make your next Seattle visit as convenient as possible I would be happy to connect you to our W Insider who can assist with local arrangements. We are glad you found our team helpful and we're working on some better signage for our entrance.",Bad

"I stayed here for two nights booked through FHR. The room itself was fine, but the front desk and check-in experience undermined the entire stay. I contacted the GM, but he never responded to or acknowledged my concerns.We were upgraded on arrival according to the FHR benefits, but the sitting area of the room had no furniture. We returned to the desk, and I was offered a room with two beds. I told them that would be fine if they were queen beds, and they said that they were. They were not (and they don't seem to have any rooms with queen beds according to their website).After waiting for 45 minutes, I was told that I would not be receiving an upgrade because I had accepted and didn't like the second room. I told them that I accepted on the condition that beds were queen sized, which was untrue. Eventually an adequate room was found for me.There are a lot of things to like about the MO Miami, but I simply did not feel like a welcome guest. The lack of response from the GM suggests that they take no issue with the level of service they are failing to provide.Dear Guest,Please allow me to personally extend my sincere apologies for the disappointing experience during your last stay at Mandarin Oriental, Miami. I am very sorry about the turn of events that you encountered and the manner in which it was handled. I assure you I did review the email you sent to my attention and addressed the incident with the front office management team I again apologize for the poor first impression and to compensate for the inconvenience, ask you to please contact the Executive Office for assistance with your next reservation. I assure you that your next stay will be seamless and enjoyable.I am at your service for any future assistance.Sincerely, Jorge GonzalezArea Vice PresidentGeneral Manager",Bad
"This hotel was beyond disgusting. The walls and ceiling were covered in mold and crumbling, there were gaping holes in the walls behind the fixtures, the bathtub was clogged and the faucet dripped. There were roaches crawling on the floors and walls in the bathroom. I will NEVER stay in a Days Inn ever again. The photos on line when I booked were very deceiving!",Bad
"I wish we could have given more stars but the lack of communication and the promises made to me by the staff is where the stars come off. We booked our reservations weeks out and requested the bottom floor because we have two under two. This hotel has NO ELEVATOR, which we knew about hence the request. We have a double stroller and after a long day at the parks we did not want to carry both babies upstairs and come back for the double stroller. When we called the morning of we spoke to Nenetzen (sp), requested a crib and wanted to make sure they would be able to honor our first level request and also let them know we would be checking in late, we were told the crib would be in our room (it was) and we would get the first level. I also called 30 minutes before arrival to also confirm that the crib was in the room and that we were on the first floor, I was also given a confirmation on both. We checked in around 1120pm and they are unable to accommodate our first floor request. I could understand if I hadn't already spoken to TWO people the day of checkin but I SPOKE TO SOMEONE 30 minutes ago. Apparently shift change happens at 11pm and we got to load both babies upstairs. I was told to call back in the morning to see if we could switch rooms, I did, and the morning person wasn't in yet to speak with and was told they would call me back.... no one ever followed up. This was very disappointing and made us not want to return back to the room for our midday nap as it was a huge inconvenience. Pros- rooms were clean, hot water and seemed to be remodeled recently. Location. Nice size rooms, it was deeper than your usual standard rooms that have the traditional narrow walkway in between the Tv and the beds, it was nice to not have to move the cribs to walk around.Cons- continental breakfast we skipped after looking at the selections, mostly donuts. Beds were very uncomfortable and the queen beds seemed more like doubles. The cribs were on the smaller side, I had called twice to ask about their size and couldn't get a clear answer so anyone else wondering they are the metal smaller cribs, close to a mini crib and smaller than a pack n play. My 22 month old could not fit in it but my 12 month old fit fine, I would say max 18 month age. There are no curtains, just shutters, so the lights that light the property will shine all night long, hard to sleep if you're used to sleeping in a dark room.We are annual passholders and will chose a different location next time.",Bad
"We were booked here thru Air Transat package. The location is convenient, the staff is really nice. However, everything else is bad! The bed spreads were stained. The bed skirt was ripped. The bathtub was broken with holes..... rust..... definitely not clean. there was hair everywhere. The only thing they did was fresh paint! There is one chair in the room and it was stained. There were stains in the ceiling, looked like a leak.It was a three star on the website but this cant be more than 2**DO NOT BOOK HERE!",Bad
Poor cleanliness. Lack of attention to coffee station. Selected room online and put somewhere else. Breakfast selections were limited. Dishes not clean at breakfast. Parking was a fiasco. Would never stay here again. Would run to the nearest alternative hotel.,Bad
"Short Staffed - Was the only one in the lobby, waited 15 minutes for the only staff member who was on the phone trying to find a reservation in the system to cancel it for someone who just made it. The caller should have been referred to the online or national call in reservation system. The hotel was sold out - perhaps Management should have thought to have more than one person on staff until midnight perhaps Dirty Bed Linens - Once in my room, was disgusted to find that one of the beds obviously had not been changed with new sheets. - Luckily it was a double queen room and the other appeared clean. The green bed covers were filthy and torn. Will not be staying at a Best Western again. Told the agent at the front desk who apologized and removed a nominal amount off the check. Travelling on business - so that really doesn't make much of a difference to me.Noisy Air Conditioning - When the under-the-window air handler came on, it sounded like an Chevy Suburban on at fast idle.Thank you for responding and providing feedback regarding your experience during your stay. I do apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused during you visit. I can assure you that we are fully staffed and two agents were scheduled for that night. Second agent left at 8:30 p.m. once things had slowed down. Unfortunately, we did receive a rush around 9:00 pm that night.

"We decided on this hotel based on its consistently positive reviews, however this was not our particular experience. Expecting a charming if not quirky older hotel in the French Quarter, we instead encountered unfriendly staff, a poorly situated and crammed room (tons of foot traffic and loud thuds coming from the building door outside our window) a sticky carpet, and most notably, an AC that blew directly onto the bed at night, resulting in a chest cold for the duration of the stay. I wish there were nicer things to say about this Inn, given its location and historic clout, but the room and the level of service of the staff we experienced were not great. Adding insult to injury, the parking arrangement (28 a day) involved putting our car in an open air lot that didn't seem particularly worth the money...we also discovered a scratch on the bumper when the car was brought to us upon hotel departure. I understand that Trip Advisor reviews have been quite positive about the French Market Inn, but had we known our stay would have been so contrary to its online reputation, we would never have stayed. Something to consider if you're looking for a pleasant hotel experience during your visit to Nola.",Bad
"After a long day at Disney we arrived at our hotel around 8:00pm. After checking in and taking out luggage to the room we discovered that the couch pull out bed was completely broken. We had only been in the room about 5 minutes. I went to the desk to ask about changing rooms or having the bed fixed. They would not move us and the bed was ...not repairable. SO, we literally had to remove the mattress from the couch and place it on the floor to sleep. NOT ACCEPTABLE for a Marriott Brand Hotel. The room price was not reduced or any concessions made for our horrible night. I am a Marriott lover, but I may have to consider changing my hotel brand.",Bad
"This place needs new management!! Jennifer the GM is about as useless as tits on a bull. Staff assured us on Monday that there were plenty rooms available!! Her staff (Christy, asst. GM)assured us on Tuesday and Wednesday that they would honor a gift certificate for one nights stay this weekend and Christy would call us back on Thursday with a confirmation because she didnt know how to enter the gift certificate into the computer. No phone call was received on Thursday so we call today. After 3 phone calls, we finally speak to the GM -Jennifer, who said they could not honor the gift certificate bc no rooms were available! This is a BOLD FACED LIE!! There are rooms available according to their website! Do not do business with this joke of a hotel! Customer service is terrible!! The staff is uneducated and clearly lacks customer service knowledge.Dear palmers1800,As I have mentioned on the many other reviews that you have written, I do apologize that we were not able to accommodate your gift certificate this past weekend. Gift certificates are donated as a courtesy to many charitable events that are important to the St. James Hotel family. On the gift certificates, we do specify that they can not be used over special event periods and are for standard rooms. Unfortunately, this past weekend was a special event and we only had 1 room available at the time we spoke which was our King Suite. I do require all gift certificates to be approved through me so I sincerely apologize if you received the incorrect information through our front desk staff. Christie, Assistant GM, began her career at the St. James only a few weeks ago and was not yet familiar with our policies and procedures regarding gift certificates. We would be more than happy to accommodate you in future. Please reach out to me directly at the below direct line. I do hope to hear from you so that we are able to show you the level of customer service that I know the St. James staff is capable or providing. Again, I apologize for any miscommunication and I look forward to hearing from you. Best, Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)962-0781",Bad
"I stayed at this hotel in October for 2 nights and it is run down, there wasn't even a glass in the room, nothing in the kitchen, carpet dirty, tub dirty and the room smelled. The second night I stayed there I went out the next morning to get into my truck and my tailgate had been stolen. I was a single woman traveling alone and felt very unsafe staying here. When I went down to the front desk to report it and check out there was only a maid working the front desk and it took 30 minutes to find someone that could help me. I filed a police report and after several tries I finally got to speak to a manager, that did no good as he just lied to me and finally the insurance company called and said they weren't paying for the tailgate. A hard lesson learned! Please, please do not stay at this hotel you are not safe, I'm just thankful I didn't walk up on them in the process of the burglar.",Bad

"Sure, I read the reviews that people wrote before we booked a room.....but I thought, some people just expect too much. I was wrong, I admit it, it definately IS as bad as people say. Oh of course this place will always have a lot of guests because it is so close to Seattle Center (about 2-1/2 blocks). The SPH owner knows this and probably feels he doesn't have to fix anything. Where do I start hmmm.. STAFF: although most are friendly, the early morning staffer is old, grumpy and smells like he hasn't taken a shower in a week. Someone spilled coffee in the breakfast room and he was swearing up a storm. He also was cranky when we complained our card key to our room didn't work. The owner/manager is also not too much of a people person. THE ROOM: our card key never worked very well, usually had to simultaneously wiggle the card back and forth in the slot, and give the door a kick. We had 3 different staff people on each day of our 3-day stay come up and open the room door for us because the key didn't work. The AC unit was behind a curtain (had to place the curtain on a chair to get air flow), was set at 60 degrees and the temperature adjustment button was broken (the room gets VERY hot without AC). The TV is very complicated to operate with a wall switch, two remotes, and a separate power box all needing to be synchronized to get it to work (we had to have a staff person come up to show us how to work it). Extremely bright construction flood lights are on all night outside the room window, so the curtain needs to be tightly closed (see above AC problem making this impossible). BREAKFAST: consists of orange juice, mini-bagels, mini-muffins, and poor coffee...skip breakfast here. The website says that they recently remodeled, but I think it was only the new floor tile in the lobby area because the rest of the place looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1950s. There is currently construction in progress on all sides of the hotel, so walking or driving to and from the parking lot is not the best or convenient. The view from our hotel room window is of the space needle and EMP, which would be great except the view is obscured by construction cranes and cement trucks. They are building a freeway tunnel behind the hotel. If you want to be near downtown, spend a few bucks more and avoid this place. Lowest price is not the best choice in Seattle.First of all, thank you for taking the time to review our property. We constantly try to provide our guests with the best possible service and hospitality, and we're sorry that we didn't meet your needs during your stay. Our policy is to provide great customer service, so we were troubled to hear that our staff was unusually negative towards you. Your concerns have been communicated to the management team to review and address. As far as the construction goes, we're sorry your beautiful view of the Space Needle was obstructed. Unfortunately, this project is out of our control, and we can guarantee that it will improve with the completion of the new tunnel. Finally, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our rooms and make them more comfortable for our guests, so we will take your comments into account. Thank you again for your review, and we hope you'll return to Seattle again soon!",Bad

We received confirmation of the cancellation and was shocked to find out that our Visa was charged the first night despite the fact that we had cancelled a week prior to our arrival.Our Visa company is now trying to recuperate our funds, but no reputable hotel would be so underhanded.

"Ok.. before I start the review - Can I just say that I always stay at budget hotels and never really have any issues.The continental plaza is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!",Bad

"Don't understand what others are saying when they say the rooms are spacious. I stayed in two of them, begged for a larger room, and was told they don't exist. These are very small rooms. The best benefits to this hotel are that it is indeed very well located and the company that owns it is a great group. But, here is what I kept thinking during my recent stay:The old mare has been ridden hard and put to bed wet. Joie de Vivre has put a 1,000 saddle on a 5 horse. Some paint (celedon), some fun art (mostly drawings and sketches) and cleaned her up a bit. But the trim is beat to hell, floor covering isn't secure in places, window air conditioners, dark rooms. If you like Joie de Vivre hotels as I do, let's encourage them to rehab the Galleria Park Hotel. She deserves it.",Bad
"Unfortunately the place was pretty old, even though they had renovated it a few years ago. When we first got to our floor, we heard a mom who was pretty upset saying they were getting the out of there. Another guest returned to room 421 saying, Pack up, we're changing rooms! And yet another guest went to the front desk to say the floor was wet when they checked into room 103 or 105 they were moved to another room too. We had four people in our room but only two sets of towels and one set of toiletries. There wasn't a safe in the room, though that was not explained I had to call the front desk to inquire, as the information card had directions on how to use the in-room safe (there aren't safes in The Annex, but there is one for all to use at the front desk). The TV didn't work for awhile, so i also called the front desk for that, and Maintenance came up the outlet it was plugged into was busted, so they just plugged it into another one and then it worked. The pool was okay, though we came down for one final dip before checking out at 11:30, but it was being cleaned -- at 10 on a Friday morning! No warning or any indication that it was going to be cleaned then, and a few guests besides ourselves were also waiting. There was also no mention of the beach chairs, umbrellas and towels, which I knew we had from the LivingSocial deal that brought us there to begin with only after asking the Concierge and going to the beach at 5 p.m., did we realize the service was only available until 6 p.m. The bathroom was the part of the room that showed the most age, especially the tub and shower, which ran at very low pressure and the temperatures were incorrectly labeled hot was cold and cold was hot. Room temperature was consistently cold too I had it at 85 degrees and it was still freezing.Now for some positives: The hotel's diner-type restaurant, Teplitzsky's, was awesome. Melissa was our waitress both at dinner and breakfast the following morning, and she was attentive and efficient, as well as very personable and friendly (she was also the only waitress at dinner, and one of two at breakfast). When we asked for more shampoo and conditioner at the front desk, housekeeping ended up delivering three more sets of toiletries, which was a nice surprise, though they were haphazardly thrown onto the counter in our bathroom (the sink of which was peeling off). Any time I dealt with the Front Desk, they were courteous and helpful. I thought I had left a ring upstairs after checking out, and they reprogrammed my room key to allow me back in. The jacuzzi was AWESOME, I have to admit wish I had more time to enjoy it, but I was with an 8-year-old so we were mostly at the pool. The retro decor in the lobby and hallway between the lobby and pool/restaurant were nice, as well as the Sea Spa's, but otherwise The Annex was just old. Oh, and it was great to have free wifi.Overall, it was a decent stay, but I doubt I'll be back, except maybe to try another part of the hotel, just not The Annex again. Either way, I would definitely go back to Teplitzsky's it was delicious and a great value, and they let us sit for as long as we wanted, which was great.",Bad

"The hotel overall is a great facility. I liked the room and the size of the room. The room was a little dated and the beds were very uncomfortable, but they are currently going through a renovation, so this should not be a problem much longer. My main issue was the service. My first impression of the hotel is what I would call the valet mafia. I just wanted to leave my car out front long enough to get checked into the hotel. The valet made me give him my key. There were several cars parked out front, which I later realized were valet customers whose cars were staying in front of the hotel and would not be moved. The check in staff was very nice and courteous. Very thorough explaining all their policies, etc. When I went back outside to move my car, I had to wait on my keys and it was obvious they were expecting a tip. After we got into our room, it was late, so we decided to just go to the restaurant in the hotel, Medici. Service was awful and we seemed to be an inconvenience for our waiter. Both mornings at breakfast in the Atrium Cafe, we received the same type of service. On Saturday evening, after returning from dinner, parking was a nightmare. Valet had taken all of the handicapped parking places at the hotel we were told we had to park in the deck which is a very long walk back through the hotel to the lobby elevators. This is not acceptable. But, my worst experience was in the lobby the morning of our check out. Apparently a guest had some type of issue. I do not know what it was, but a hotel employee (I think they were from the food service staff, maybe a chef) was working with them and appeared very put out with the guest. Situations like this happen, but what I found totally unprofessional was after hotel employee spoke with the guest again and coming to no solution, he walked back over the the front desk and told the front desk person that he was not dealing with this --. Totally unprofessional.Thank you so much for taking the time to give us your feedback, it is very helpful to hear about the experience our customers have had. I am very dissapointed with what you have described, particularly with the service in my hotel. It is not typical and I would like to learn more to enable me to follow through on your experience.

"We have been very happy at Joie de Vivre hotels in SF and could not have been more dissapointed by this experience. We had trouble from the start--rude front desk staff, bellmen who never even attempted to help with baggage, problems with the bill and double charging our credit card, mishandled arrangments with the airport pick-up, and a very sub-standard room for a steep price (nearly 400/night). We ultimately got an upgrade since we were paying too much for such a small room (and are members of JdV), but the damage was done by the rude front desk service and general incompetence. A good thing: The housekeepers are nice. The hotel doesn't offer the services that a hotel charging these prices should have--for example, they have limited room service (none on weekend mornings), no concierge , terrible gym, etc. Do yourself a favor and stay someplace else!I would like to start by thanking you for taking time to write and provide feedback about your recent stay. However, I am very sorry your experience was completely unfavorable. We truly pride ourselves in quality customer service, as one might read from many of the other TripAdvisor postings, and clearly fell short of delivering the consistent wonderful service that many of our Joie de Vivre members and other guests experience. Please feel free to contact the hotel directly so that I may find a way to resolve and change your opinion as I truly care about how you feel. Thanks so much for hopefully giving us a chance to make a potential future stay better and let us show you that we can do it right.

"Halloween weekend a friend and I booked a room at the Annex so we could enter into the various Halloween contests at the Tropicana. A room at the Tropicana was too expensive for our budget so we booked at the Annex which is next door to the Tropicana. The neon red light that says The Annex was the first giveaway something was wrong. We started joking about ladies of the night and hourly rates as soon as we saw it. Then there was a blinking red light pointing upstairs and again we joked about older married men that need a place to bring young nave women. The hallways were Big Bird Yellow and the carpet was old and moldy in the hallways. The room was worse. There was a horrible smell in the room, the white lamp shades were egregiously stained and pieces of the bathroom floor tile were missing. I complained about the smell and I was given an upgrade at the Chelsea which was 100 times better than the Annex. I honestly think they will upgrade anyone that complains. If you don't complain and you aren't upgraded it will be the worse hotel you have ever stayed at - guaranteed.",Bad

"My partner booked us a twin bed room thinking it was the San Francisco Hostel International. What a mistake! We were given an incredibly squeaky (aka you can't roll over without waking up the whole floor including yourself) single bunk bed with stained mattresses. There was also some kind of unidentified matter smeared across the wall which could have easily been cleaned if they could be bothered. The bathrooms, halls etc we're all equally filthy.We asked to be changed into a twin bed room (as we had booked) or a double and we're constantly fobbed off by each staff member. Each would tell us to come back and speak to them again in x hours (when their shift had finished). When we went back they would be gone and it would start again. This also included the manager. I understand this place is closing in a few months (my guess is due to being shut down by health and safety) and as a result the staff do not care in the least. If you have another option then take it. And before you think this person sounds like a prude or is being precious I have stayed in probably 100 hostels allover the world and this is by far the worst. It also really affected our holiday in San Fran as there was no chance of sleep in the squeaky bunk bed. I note there are some decent reviews however most of them seem to be for the other hostel we tried to book (there ain't no waffles here!).You've been warned!!!",Bad
"Do not trust what you read on the hotel's website. This is emphatically NOT a luxury, boutique hotel. It is not artful, luxurious, or intimate as the website claims. It is a poorly maintained, mediocre hotel. Tiny cramped lobby tiny, ancient, slow elevator barely big enough for two people and one piece of luggage each. Cramped room, so small the door to the bathroom only opened half way before it hit one of the two double beds. Old, cheap furnishings (my wife said it was reminiscent of the furnishings she had in her first apartment after college). The mattress was so hard we had to put the comforter under the bottom bed sheet to try to add some softness. Like sleeping on lightly padded plywood. Bathroom had stained grout on the tile, mold in the corners, stains on the mirror, dysfunctional shower head... (I have submitted pictures to document the poor quality and maintenance of the room.) And this was a better room than the first one they put us in. The original room was blazingly hot and the only window for ventilation opened onto a noisy street. At our request, they moved us to the third floor on the back side of the hotel. Three friends of ours got a room here, too, and they complained about the heat and noise. The hotel's breakfast consisted of a bunch of loaves of bread, a toaster, peanut butter and jam, and coffee and tea. There was a small refrigerator and microwave in the room, fortunately. I can only recommend this hotel if you can get a room for 100/night or less and you don't really care about quality or comfort. It's only asset is location. They do have a nice wine bar.Dear Paul H,we are sorry you did not have a good experience at the FItzgerald Hotel. As you have mentioned in your review, boutique hotels have usually a particular style which is different from city to city, and that varies from one boutique hotel to another: the Fitzgerald hotel does have its own unique style, which is a classic post-Victorian San Francisco one, with a furnishing and an elevator that are meant to recall that time. We understand that some customers may not like it, but that is also what makes the Fitzgerald hotel different from the others. Also, since we are downtown, there is nothing much we can do about the noise, but we will follow up on your suggestion and try to see whether we can do some work to better isolate the building from street noise. With respect to the poor maintenance, I have printed out your review and passed it on to our staff who is already working on fixing the issues you were mentioning: thank you very much for that. We hope your experience won't prevent you from staying again with us next time you are in San Francisco, and until then we will work to make sure that most of the issues you have found will be resolved. Thank you again for staying with us!",Bad

"Trip was Oct 16-18. Hotel is not suitable for normal tourists. It is adjacent to and connected to a hospital. It may be suitable for patients or their families, but it is not something a tourist would want. The hotel is very old. There is a skeleton staff. The web site shows a nice food service area or restaurant. During our stay, there was no restaurant at all. These photos should be taken down. They are misleading at the least. There is no parking with this hotel. The desk will refer you to a public lot around the corner. The public parking has issues: (a) it has limited spaces for public use and you may be out of luck on a busy time (we did find one available) (b) it is not cheap (c) the main complaint here is that there is no in and out in this public lot. So, this is not like a valet parking where you pay one day and can go in and out. You park and are stuck or risk additional fees etc. The rooms are very small. The bathroom is tiny (one person only). The furniture in the room is old and not comfortable. Two chairs and a small table. You must be in the bed to view the TV comfortably. Food: as noted, there is no restaurant in the hotel. The food - - aka room service actually comes from the hospital kitchen. There is an elevator connection to the hospital, and you can eat in the hospital cafeteria. Otherwise, there is no food in the hotel. The staff was one person at the desk. No bell man etc. There may be ways to get a wheel chair into the hotel, but I did not see them. I saw several elderly ladies in walkers have a very difficult time getting up the 6 to 9 stairs at the entrance. The owners have put no money to update this hotel. If you call one of the room service numbers, the first prompt is for you to provide your glucose tolerance numbers. Quite a shock for a tourist with a first time in Seattle. On one occasion, I called the front desk. Let it ring 15 to 20 times. No answer. When I went down, I asked: why was no one answering the phone at the desk The answer: I was out for a moment across the street. It is also worth noting that there is only one elevator in the hotel for guests. Not a problem as long as few people are in the hotel. It was very slow a few times when the Seahawks game came closer. This is not an upscale neighborhood. There is a nice breakfast place about a 5 minute walk away. Starbucks an easy 10 minute walk (Well run Starbucks). From what we saw walking down to the ferry would not wise. There are good number of homeless folks down closer to the Seahawks and Mariners stadium (a Salvation army facility is quite near the stadiums). I did not feel it was unsafe for myself, but would not want my wife and I to walk that way. In summary, THIS HOTEL IS AN HOSPITAL ADJUNCT. It is not a place where a tourist would want to stay unless were the dominant concern and staying downtown was required. It is simply a very old hotel with limited staff, no food (unless you like hospital food), misleading photos on the Trip Advisor site showing a food area, no parking, and nothing to show that the owners have put any at all to improve it. I booked on hotel.com and was disappointed. For the price one does not expect a 4 star facility. But one would expect more than what this hotel provides.Thank you for your review. We are sorry to learn you did not enjoy your stay with us. The Inn is older. . .many of our guests find it charming and comfortable. The setting is more residential, off the main shopping/activity corridor but convenient enough you can still walk to Pike Place Market or the Convention Center.

We are very proud to be a part of the Virginia Mason Medical Center campus.

I needed a taxi twice and both times I gave the front desk staff ample notice about needing a taxi but they could not get a taxi to arrive on time or arrive at all. In one instance when the taxi did not show up I almost missed a ferry on which I was scheduled and I would have had to wait a day for the next ferry.One of the hotel managers said they had 'problems' getting taxi's to come to the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel did not share that with me until it was too late. Otherwise I would have handled my transportation needs myself and not rely on the hotel.My suggestion is not to rely on the hotel for transportation, make your own arrangements.Hello James D.!

Got in my room and the first thing I noticed was it smelled like pose. My wife went to the bathroom and saw a dead smashed roach on the floor and a small one in the tub. They had no towels or rags in the bathroom as we would not use them anyway from what we were experiencing. We slept with our clothes on and checked out asap. I booked another hotel while staying the night there. Didn't care about the discount just wanted out of there. Didn't get any sleep as we took turns staying up to make sure no unwanted friends wanted to tag along.,Bad
"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",Bad
"This place was a last minute internet booking, we flew back home the next day, will never happen again. The bed sheets seemed used already, there were nasty staines on the side of the matress that was not covered. The towels had a bad, dirty smell to them, need I say more... We stayed out for dinner late so the night would be shorter, and slept with our entire clothes on so our skin would not touch the sheets. Do not go there, this place is really, really bad!",Bad
This had to be one of the poorest experiences I've had at a JW. The front desk staff made little effort to rectify their errors despite me booking this room well in advance. I was put in a handicap room with no attempts to recover the situation. I would take my money and go somewhere else next timeThank you for your recent visit. I want to personally apologize for your disappointment. Please know that I have personally followed up with our front office team as a learning to see how we could have made your experience more positive. We do strive to exceed our guests expectations and to ensure they have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Thank you for your feedback. I hope you will consider a future visit.,Bad
"When we told the front desk about the lack of hot water they said they'd known and were working on it. We didn't have much hot water in our two days. No cell reception in center rooms. No natural light - if we opened our shades we were looking directly into our neighbors' bedroom. It's really too bad as the staff is friendly and the rooms are spacious. You can't beat the location. They offer complimentary shuttle service within a mile, which is helpful, and a cooked breakfast but the eggs are disgusting.",Bad
Called several days ahead to make sure we had lakeside.Was told maybe but to check early on the day of our stay. When we arrived we were told not a chance. But we would have a room with a view of the space needle. What we got was a street level room with a view of a six story building behind the hotel. We were later moved to city view seventh floor. Breakfast was warm to cold. Wi fi on the other hand was very good. But not for 300. Edgewater is a little more but worth it. Terry from PortlandThanks for your feedback and I apologize for your frustration with your room. We upgrade guests to the lake view rooms when possible but the only surefire way to guarantee a lake view room is to reserve one from the start. I am sorry if this wasn't fully explained at the time you made your reservation. Our views of Lake Union are amazing!,Bad

Tons of very loud kids in the pool and whirlpool, which was annoying. Management didn't seem to be in the mood to enforce any of the rules against, for example, jumping and kids without adults.

"Staff was friendly and responsive. I asked for directions one time and the check-in lady was overly-helpful. The continental breakfast in the morning was not your crappy bread and fruit breakfast.

"I absolutely agree that the location is great. You can take the Metro from the airport, get off at the Westlake Center and walk three blocks to the hotel. Convention Center is 2 blocks away. Here are the pluses and minueseROOMI upgraded to a King view room. Suppose to be a nicer room on the 24th floor or above. The room was the exact same room with the exact same view as a friend had on the 21st floor. What I will say is the bathroom is fabulous. Soaking tub and separate shower, large vanity, robes. But the quality and quantity of the towels didn't live up to the rest of the bathroom. FACILITIESThere is no restaurant, no bar, nothing. There is a Starbucks around the corner. Its very odd given that the hotel has a small conference center. There is a Ruth and Chris' Steak House next door but the bar there is very small. And a major downside is that the lobby smells of cooking meat from about 3:00 on.Great work out facility. One of the best I've seen.Executive lounge is okay but doesn't have the amenities of Hilton, marriott, Westin etc. BREAKFASTWe had a AAA package that was suppose to include a full breakfast. It turned out to be that a very small continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge with an additional chaffing dish of eggs and a meat CUSTOMER SERVICEIt was okay during the stay but had major trouble with my bill. I got charged 3x the room upgrade. I called in to customer service and told that I was mistaken on the cost of the upgrade and that there was no way I could have gotten information to the contrary because it would mean a flaw in the reservation system. Fortunately, I still had a copy of the e-mail that showed the correct amount. When I sent it in I did not get an apology or anything even though I explained how challenging it was to have to deal with credits etc. with my company.

"Be aware - the hotel has no air conditioning -- something they bury deep in their website and something you'd probably never think to ask. It was in the mid-70's when I was there and the temperature in my room was fine. They do have very large and very effective ceiling fans and the windows do open about a foot to let the air in. But... c'mon -- no A/C in a downtown hotel Otherwise, the hotel is just OK - it's clean and the rooms are a decent size, but it obviously hasn't been renovated in 20-30 years and it shows around the edges. There is free wifi, though, so you'll save 15 over a name brand hotel there...Dear Guest,Thank you for posting a review about our hotel on trip advisor. We really appreciate your feedback.

"I stayed two nights mid-week in March. I didn't pay extra for the bay view but got it because just as we got in there was a large group of German tourists who just came in, which probably booked other rooms.The two queen beds were comfortable. and the pillows were nice and fluffy. In fact we saw many being replaced the day we checked in. (They were taking out old mattresses and bringing in new ones.) The amenities are good. A TV with cable, a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker made the fact that there's no continental breakfast easy, since there's a rite-aid down the street we bought hot-pockets and ate those in the morning. The view of the bay is amazing although it's true there is a concstruction sight to the right it's not very noticeable when you have the sun setting and the Star of India right in front of you.The pool isn't special and the jets on the hottub didn't work very well but the hottub was hot so that was nice after hours of walking. There are towels in the pool area which I also thought was nice. The constuction was not as noisy as people have said, although to be honest my friends and I left our room about 10:30 everyday and returned in the evening 6pm- midnight. Noise is a problem though as there is a railroad crossing a few blocks away, which you can hear clearly even with the balcony window shut. At night, cruise ships dock at the harbor which is also a few blocks away but the boats horn woke me and my friends up. This happened both nights we stayed and the second night two cruise ships came in so we were awakened twice that night!!! I can't imagine any of the other hotels in the area being any better though. There are hotels right across the street from the harbor which I think have to hear the same noise. I believe it's just a consequence of staying in a city.The area of the hotel isn't particularly nice, but it isn't particulary ghetto either. If you walk up India Street like 2 blocks there are a lot of nice little shops and places to eat and drink. (It's Little Italy) You can pretty much walk everywhere you want to go or take a cab - Horton Plaza to the hotel was 4. The parking lot is strangely full. I assumed many construction workers park thier cars there because once they were gone the parking lot cleared up a bit. The lack of an elevator in the parking lot is annoying because the stairs look gross. My friend drove down to the lobby, we took out the luggage and then she drove back up to find parking somewhere. 7 a night for parking is not bad at all, I'm surprised this is even a complaint. We didn't even use the car while in San Diego. We walked to the Harbor and took the Old Town Trolley hop on hop off tour that takes you pretty much everywhere you want to go in the city as a tourist.",Neutral

"Hotel Abri has a good friendly team of front desk staff and a simply trendy lobby that gave me a good impression to start. The room is small and only minimally functional for a group of four (I should've checked the footage before I booked a double room for four). We had a street-facing room so it was really really noisy at night given the frequent ambulance, passengers and especially the construction noise that went beyond midnight (I didn't know that construction was allowed after 11pm in SF). Service and notes in the room were a bit confusing and inconsistent. There was no introduction pamphlets describing services of the hotel, no sign in the room stating that the water bottles weren't free. Out of my four night stays, one night I did not have enough towels, one with water not replenished, and another without any coffee/tea replenished in the room. Other minor inconvenience include not having hand soap provided, and the hotel does not have shoe horns to lend out. At the end I would still give this hotel a positive vote given their friendly front desk service and convenience of location.",Neutral

"I stayed here in Anaheim in mid August 2013 after reading many reviews. I reserved the 2 bedroom suite which only has 1 bathroom and the rooms are extremely small, hence the tiny beds (that claim to be doubles). We are a family of six- 2 adults and four children - 14 to 4 and the space was quite cramped. The hotel needs updating- furnishings are worn out. The drawers in the rooms were scratched and lights were quite dim in the bedroom. The full size kitchen is ok but rather small and the utensils and plates were not in the best condition. The breakfast area is very small and extremely limited. the staff was very friendly but I was overall disappointed that this is a Marriott property. I opted to only spend one night here and changed hotels the next day to give everyone enough space and an additional bathroom.Thank you for staying with us I apologize that your stay was not a pleasant one. Thank you for bring this to our attention as this will only help us improve.

"For the price, this was a very nice hotel with some wonderful extras such as Quick Queue for the 7 major rides at Sea World for your entire party. The rooms are average and breakfast was much better than expected. My complaint when it came to breakfast was there were far too few waffle irons (2) for the number of guests their placement. However, This seems to be an issue everywhere. This creates a major roadblock as guests are waiting in line for a considerable amount of time and blocking the rest of the buffett.My biggest complaint was housekeeping - While my room on the surface was clean but quite obviously had not been vacuumed for a while as there was long hair everywhere. My other complaint was the thin walls and the long corridor make each floor an echo chamber. you will every door slam, conversations from the other end of the floor, and crying baby.",Neutral
"I want to like the Vertigo Hotel. It's quaint. It's charming. It's off the beaten path. And its staircase has a Hitchcock movie connection. It is one of many renovated small hotels in San Francisco. I like boutique hotels. While it's several blocks from Union Square, I easily walked it. Its a bit closer to the Tenderloin and I suppose the nearby grittiness adds to the charm. It's a neighbourhood hotel, not in the middle of the city and touristy madness. The staff know the area and make good suggestions for restaurants and things to do.With respect to usability, especially for business, it leaves a lot to be desired. The wifi is slow. It is shabby and worn. At one point the Orange in the lobby was bright and modern. Now it is faded. Check in includes instructions on how to use the shower because it is not obvious. The website says parking is available but fails to mention it is either expensive valet or several blocks away. In the final analysis, while adequate for business, it is better suited for visitors on holiday. I am glad to have had the experience of staying there, but will probably choose another hotel for my next visit. And yet it remains charming.",Neutral
"We have been to this hotel probably about 3 times but this time our room was very small so a little disappointed. Luckily we are not there too much so it was ok. Rooms were cleaned late in the afternoon usually after 3pm so if we were out during the day it was a little unlucky that you couldn't rest until your room was cleaned because you would be woken. Rooms were clean bed was comfortable and staff were friendly. I think when you want them to book you a shuttle and you have a coupon that is cheap it was suggested that the shuttle company was unreliable so recommended who they used which was a bit more expensive. The water for the tea and pre made coffee was not hot enough in the foyer so I would always check first and if not hot enough the staff are able to get hot water for you out the back from a room which wasn't a problem for them. The hotel is situated in a side street which is quieter but close to everything. To catch a trolley was easy you just walk down the laneway next to the hotel and you are at the DFS where they start from so you would get a seat .Aloha,Thank you for your feedback!

"Great service! Ben Patel on the concierge were very helpful. I think it's the only non pretentious budget accommodation in downtown Atlanta. The rooms were spacious and had a nice balcony view. I stayed there before and after my Tomorrowland trip in 2014. The best part of Motel 6 downtown is that it is at a very quiet location it is near to all the attractions i.e. World of Coca Cola, Georgia Aquarium, CNN headquarters. Also you'll find plenty of coffee shops and restaurants on a short walk. Hooters Hard Rock Cafe were near. And the downside is you will not find the like minded tourist crowd in this neighborhood as this is a strictly financial district.",Neutral
"We have stayed there previously. Location is convenient, most front desk people are very helpful, breakfast is all right. Rooms can be noisy.However: we were given room 209 which had its only window 3' from the restaurant exhaust system. The smell of food permeated the room. And, the A/C could not be used because it, too, was adjacent to the exhaust. We thought we would give it a try until my wife found hairs and red spots on the sheet.The front desk lady was extremely nice and pleasant as she is always. We moved to another room that had a roll away in it. Quickly I noticed black residue appearing on the white sheets. A quick check of the A/C filter showed it must not have been changed since Katrina...........black mold was all over the filter. And, on the sheets. The bathroom was not cleaned well. Hairs were around the tub and elsewhere. In short, housekeeping is not good. Cleaning is not acceptable. We elected to stay because we were tired of moving rooms and did not want to try and find another motel. Perhaps we should have done so. Overall, this place has potential but it needs a thorough cleaning as it has become mediocre Close off the room next to the restaurant exhaust. Clean the carpets and clean the rooms thoroughly. We will try the next door Hampton Inn next visit.",Neutral
"Walked into the room and it was small and sparsely furnished but, I guess there really was no room for a table. The A/C-Heat was the typical in that it had 2 temperatures (arctic and sauna) and nothing in between. The TV was difficult to turn off and on. There was only 1 glass in the entire room. The toilet had to be jiggled to stop running. This room was across the hall from a storage room and there seemed to be constant noise all the time. It seemed to be a novel way to turn a run down motel into a boutique hotel with a few contemporary furnishings that could not disguise the fact that it was an old motel. The tub had numerous gouges in it and you could see daylight threw the door (great insulation). We were charged an extra 10 to park and after returning from going out to dinner all the hotels spots were taken and we had to park 3 blocks away. We checked out and were never asked how our stay was or even thank you for staying with us. Will not be returning or recommending this hotel to friends or family.Good day and Happy Holidays. In receipt of your review. Very sorry you were disappointed with your experience. all of your comments are noted and will be discussed with management.

"We stayed for three nights in late July 2015. Rooms have been recently renovated and are nice, though beds were a bit hard and squeaky. The continental breakfast was not fancy but good quality and selection, and there is an outdoor patio upstairs (insider tip) with 5 or 6 little tables and maybe a dozen chairs that made for a chill start to our pleasant mornings. The front desk staff was very helpful with suggestions and directions, and check in / out was easy. A good value, not fancy but not bad. I'd stay there again.",Neutral

"Over priced compared to where we stayed the night before. We stayed at Hotel Karlan-san Diego double tree by Hilton for 7 more on a Saturday. We stayed here on Sunday. First room had a blown outlet, with no power to night stand wall. Manager moved us into another room. (Thank you)Then, second room smelled like stail air. Took awhile to vent out. Shower drain was clogged, and had to wash down some small spiders.Staff was very nice. Dear Down99Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel. I am sorry to hear that the 1st room had a blown outlet but I am glad to see that you were moved for the issue to be resolved. It looks like the reset was not enough to fix the issue. We are not pleased to hear that the second room air smelled stail. That is not what we want our rooms to smell like.

"Nice enough building. Looks almost like an Embassy Suites inside. Free parking is great, but if want a bowl of oatmeal and cup of coffee for breakfast, it will cost you 15.

"Wanted a funky old hotel and that is what we got. Room was very small, but clean. Had some plumbing problems that they could not fix before we left. Had to use the lobby toilet. Too much noise late at night on a Sunday. Free breakfast was a couple of packages of English muffins and a toaster. Cool neighborhood. Close to downtown.Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. All of our rooms are different and we do have larger rooms depending on how much you want to spend. It sounds like you stayed in one of our budget friendly rooms which do tend to be smaller. Sorry to hear that you had plumbing issues, we normally would move you unless we were at capacity. I do apologize for the inconvenience this issue caused you. Our breakfast is complimentary and is comparable to industry standards (English muffins, bagels, toast, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, cereal, milk, juice coffee). If you are looking for a hot breakfast in the future there are several great options within walking distance. Best, Kristin Anderson, Assistant Hotel Manager",Neutral
"Well we booked a room here since my gf likes boutique hotels and laid back atmosphere they usually provide. This hotel was not in the area we thought it was in, actually it was pretty far from what we expected. As it turns out that was a good thing. We weren't to far from Ocean Beach which is a fun experience in itself, and not to far from Pacific beach as well. They provide free beach crusier rentals and we had fun taking those out to get around quicker. Now the Hotel itself is in a somewhat run down area, and there isn't anything to see unless you bike for 30 minutes but we had an adventure because of it. Downstairs as all the other review say is fun. You can play board games get a drink and hang with a mixed crowd of people while enjoying a seat by the pool. The room is average, maybe a little below. It was clean (other than stain on sheet) and for the age it was descent. But we need to point out that the age does make a difference. The bathroom is dated, and the basic feel is a converted Motel 6 into a retro style hotel. But then again we didn't stay in the room long so those facts didn't bother me. The staff was friendly and very personable which makes up for the hotels state of disaray. I would recommend this hotel if you are open minded, enjoy people and music, and like the out of the box experience that you can't have at a huge hotel. Go have an adventure, get a bike and cruise to Ocean Beach.. just doing that makes the day rememberable.. LOLThanks for the review. very good suggestion on borrowing the bikes and going for a ride. it's a great way for guest to see Pt. Loma, Downtown or Ocean Beach. we appreciate your support and hope you will come visit us again soon.",Neutral

"We stayed for two nights and chose this location because it was close to things we wanted to do. My first issue is the parking and there's not enough spaces. We had a suite that had a closed off living room but the AC unit was in that room and so even with the door open the rest of the room was hot. There was fan on wall but it was so loud you couldn't talk. The room was very small, so much that only one person could fit between the tv and bed. The shower was horrible. The temp never stayed the same. The doors into the building and the elevators were barely functioning. The pool was dirty and the surrounding area. Breakfast was okay. The staff was not very friendly or accommodating. We have never been to CA and so we had a lot of questions and the staff acted like it was such a burden to answer them. Overall I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't let my friends or family go either. Dear guest,I apologize for not meeting your expectations. I have shared your comments with our GM and Staff.

"The rooms were as expected from a Best Western. Nothing special, but very clean. The grounds were very well kept and had beautiful plants that it felt very tropical. Parking was near the room so very convienient, but like a motel experience where the cars are all pulled up in front of the room doors. We enjoyed our visit.",Neutral
"Had trouble with flights so had to stay here for one night unexpectedly. It is a weird property for a Hilton, and doesn't feel upscale at all. My room was fine and unusually large. The bed was comfortable, I had hot water and decent water pressure. I didn't do any heavy lifting with the wifi but it was solid for me. The airport shuttle was quick and easy. They had a (paid) breakfast but I didn't partake. The best part was the staff at the front desk, they must have stolen them from Disney, as they were exceptionally friendly and helpful. No real complaints, but they charged me more than my Disney hotel did, for far less value, and that just left a bad taste in my mouth. If the price had been lower, I would've rated this higher.Robb H, thank you for your review.

"Pros: The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our special needs.Cons: Water pressure needs to be addressed. Was almost impossible to take a shower.This hotel is right across the street from the Disneyland entrance. So convenient to come and go all day long. I have found that all hotels are about the same. Definitely not a 5 star place but its just a place to lay your head and rest up to play again the next day! Breakfast was very simple. Pastries, toast, oatmeal, cereal and juice. A very limited fruit selection was available as well. Water pressure was extremely low which made it difficult to shower. The hotel includes a pool and hot tub. The staff was super friendly.

"I found the hotel to be overpriced for what you get and somewhat dated. The location is fine for the business traveller, however, there is nothing in the immediate area for anyone visiting for leisure purposes.The rooms and the hotel is a little dated with horrible yellow/orange tiles evident throughout the hotel.You will have to pay for everything - parking and internet access borders on extortion.We also had issues with ants in the room which you would not expect from a supposed high end hotel. The head housekeeper who came to the room to investigate after seeing the evidence of the ants was apologetic.If you have stayed in a MO property in Asia, you will likely be disappointed if you expect the same standard of accommodation and service.",Neutral
"We stayed at this property in advance of a week long trip with an 0700 flight time. Since we live 40 miles out, we decided to stay in town instead of driving in for our flight that morning. Our stay on the way out was lovely. We enjoyed a great meal in the bar, watched some of the Olympics and chatted with another guest who was in town covering the Arlington Million. Our room was lovely and we took a nightcap back to watch the planes fly over (every 2 minutes) and enjoy the sounds of the families at the pool. The fact that all of this was on the completely non-smoking property, it was a lovely evening. Our shuttle driver was promptly on site at 0530 to leave for the airport. But, of course, there was one guest who couldn't manage to be on time. While we arrived at the prescribed 10 minutes prior and others arrived in advance of the van arriving, the front desk called due to one, single guest who couldn't get his act together. Because they were so overly accommodating to him, I was completely blown away by the shuttle trip upon our return.We arrived at the airport, got our luggage and called the hotel. They informed us to go to door 2 at the shuttle center. We proceeded there - it is about a 7 minute walk for tired, suitcase lugging travelers. We arrived at the assigned door at 2316. With a number of vans there, we were trying to see what each of them were when we saw a Marriott van pull away and drive off - EMPTY. So, I called the hotel to ask whether their driver had just driven away even though we had called and he should have been alerted that there were travelers arriving. I was told that the van runs every half hour and that the next one would be at 2330. I inquired whether this meant that the van would be ON THE WAY or was expected to ARRIVE at that time. I never really got a clear answer. When a van finally arrived on the property at 2352, I started to understand WHY I wasn't given a clear answer. While we waited 36 minutes for a van, some others told us they had been waiting over an hour. Additionally, they stated they had called the hotel and been told that THEY missed the VAN. I am not sure how it is possible for the guest to MISS THE VAN - surely the driver has some responsibility for getting out and announcing himself when they are parked (stacked) in 2 lanes of traffic.Then, upon our arrival at the hotel, I used my parking ticket as instructed to leave the parking lot without paying the daily fees only to get an error message that my ticket was invalid and my fee due was 241.00. I tried 3 times and then started to go back to a parking space to walk back to the hotel and wait while the 40 people on the van got checked in to their rooms to get a valid ticket to get my car out of the lot when our friend noted that another gate was open for an event that was concluding. We pulled through it and left. I fly out of O'Hare on average 12 - 15 times per year for business and pleasure. I use park sleep fly once or twice a year. And I am an active Marriott member. I thought that I had found a new favorite but this experience leaves me irritated a day later. When I park at the airport, I can be off the property and on the road in a half hour. Last night, with a flight arrival time of 2230, we were finally on the highway at 0020. This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Needless to say, I will be calling the GM at the hotel and possibly corporate later this week.Good Morning DLogsdon,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I apologize about the experience you had with the airport shuttles during your stay. I will make sure to share your comments with the appropriate staff. It is hard to say what exactly occurred during the time you were waiting for our shuttle at the airport and various things such as traffic, as well as trying to accommodate all of our guest could effect the exact time of arrival at the airport. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you,",Neutral
"I would stay here again because of its great location across from the park. We had a room with a bunk bed for the kids, which they really enjoyed.

Also, parking is not free but it is valet serviced.",Neutral

"The staff was very courteous and went out of their way to be helpful. Had it not been for the staff, the hotel would have gotten a lower review. The lobby was well done with plenty of (mostly comfortable) seating. The elevators (when working) were very fast however one of them seemed to enjoy eating people (doors would close on you when exiting the elevator and would not spring back..I had to force the doors back open on more than one occasion). Over the course of the weekend the number of working elevators dwindled to one which caused overly excessive wait times. (At one point on Sunday, I waited for over 10 minutes for the singe working elevator.. I finally gave up and carried my luggage down the fire stairs).The room was okay, but not what I expected from a high end hotel. The room was more on par with some other more economical hotels I have stayed in recently. The air conditioner was noisy and would not cool the room. Except for the bed side tables, there were no drawers to unpack into (there were shelves under the TV, but they just do not work as well). In the bathroom the tub would not drain and there was mold growing on the tiles/groutAlso parking is expensive at 22/night (self park).Once again the staff was great and somewhat made up for the other issues.Thank you for your post and candid feedback. While I am happy to learn our staff was courteous and went the extra mile to be helpful, I am sorry you experienced challenges with the elevators and your guest room. You can be certain that I will have our engineering team take a look at the elevators to ensure they are in proper working order. As well, I have already asked that our engineering and housekeeping teams conduct room inspections to insure the air-conditioning units and tub drains are in proper working order.

"I really enjoyed the room and vibe at the Hyatt House in Seattle. It was a great hotel to chill out and get work done. We were able to work all day during a rainstorm and the room was comfortable and large enough for 2 people to never cross paths while working.My only complaint is that they checked me out early before my guest was ready and they woke him up and interrupted him 9 times between the time I left and he checked out. Upon calling the hotel, the staff was very apologetic and gave him a nice bottle of wine to compensate for the miscommunication.",Neutral
"We came into the city a few days ago on a whim. We had no reservations, no plans to visit San Francisco, and no real forethought. We just thought, Hey, let's go to San Fran! so we just rolled in. After frantically searching for a room in a couple of downtown hotels, we finally got a room here for a couple of nights. So it's not cheap, but hey... We are staying in a the center of a major US city, and it certainly isn't the most expensive hotel we've ever stayed in. Be advised, parking is expensive. And while I wouldn't call it up-scale, it is very nice. It appears that the hotel has been recently renovated, and our room was nicely remodeled. The furnishings and decor are all very relevant to today's modern styles. The bathroom is about as physically small as possible, but big enough to get your business done. I mean how much time do you need to spend in there anyway The bed is super comfortable, which is really nice when you are on a road-warrior styled vacation like we are now! It is true that there is no bellman, but that's ok for me, as that is one less person I need to budget my cash for. I'm happy to carry my own bags. The location is fine, as we have been able to walk all around downtown, Chinatown, and the surrounding neighborhoods. Oh, and they have this nice water jug in the lobby, with fruit in the water, which tastes really nice! It's been a fine place to stay for this trip.Michael S - Thank you for such a detailed review about your stay.

"I stayed in February 2013. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was nice, pastries, waffles, juice, bagels, etc. I saw other guests around the hotel that looked fine and some others that looked shady. The condition of the outside of the hotel could use some work. My room appeared clean and in good condition with the exception of stains on the carpet, a rocking toilet, and water stains in the cabinet under the sink. The rooms are spacious and really comfortable with two TVs. The location was great. It's really close to Piedmont St. and a really nice neighborhood. Not a far drive from the interstate. It's about 5-10 mins from Peachtree which has lots of shopping, dining, and entertainment. It's about 30 mins from the GA Intl Convention Center and the airport. I thought the hotel was a major bargain as I booked it on hotels.com for 63 but one major complaint was the lack of soundproofing. I had some obnoxiously loud people above me that appeared to be stomping on the floor for about 10 mins. I heard conversations in the room next to me. And I heard every person that went up or down the stairs outside my door.Thank you for your recent feedback of our property. I am glad to hear that you were pleased with the breakfast, helpfulness of our staff, and cleanliness of the room. I am also happy to hear that you found the location of our property convenient to shopping and dining. Hopefully you had the opportunity to sample some of the many fine dining establishments that are in close proximity of our hotelI am sorry to hear that you had issues with noise from the surrounding rooms and stairs. Unfortunately, we were unaware of these problems at the time so were unable to address them.

"This hotel is beautiful, no doubt. Courteous staff even though not empowered to control the noise. Problem 1: Atrium layout and the noise carries up all floors and into every room. Problem 2: the restaurant had a duo of music both nights until 11:00pm. (Would have been pleasant and even lulled us to sleep if talented). Problem 3: young local urban crowd walking guest room halls making plenty more noise. Cherry on the cake of our stay. Bottom line, our weekend away at this hotel, not a respite from the long week.

"I love staying at Hilton Hotels and earning my rewards but Garden Inns besides being a Hilton and clean do not offer anything extra like the Hampton has free breakfast or the Double Tree has free, warm chocolate chip cookies. The service was ok but it also costs more than the Hampton and you get less. We used the wifi and that was ok too. The pool was nice but no hot tub. That does seem to be a struggle for our family to find a hot tub in the Hilton Hotels. I would try the Hampton across the street before I stayed here again.Dear Shari, We appreciate your candid feedback about your recent stay. Our sincere apologies that you were not aware that we did not have a hot tub on property and did not provide complimentary breakfast or complimentary cookies upon arrival. We realize that complimentary breakfast is important to family travelers so we do offer the Family Fun package which includes complimentary breakfast and additional amenities to ensure our travelers are extremely satisfied during their stay.

"I stayed with a friend at the Freehand for two nights in a queen bed private room. The room was quiet and clean, but very small. My friend and I were climbing over each other and our suitcases to move around the room. One thing that ruined the room for us was the lack of control over the temperature of the room. The weather in Chicago that week was in the mid-upper 60s, but the room was WARM. There's an A/C unit in the room, but no matter what we did to fiddle with it, it just would not get cool. Tiny room + humidity from showers + stubborn A/C + poor window ventilation stuffy stuffy stuffy.What also wasn't fun was being charged an extra 6.35 on my credit card when I checked my billing statement a week after checking out. I called in to ask about the charge and was told we had used the water in the mini bar. We had not. The front desk employee was nice enough to remove the charge, but is it not standard hotel practice to provide a bill of charges to guests before they check out Not doing so is at best questionable (why risk upsetting guests by not verifying mini bar purchases), and at worst predatory (are you just hoping we wouldn't notice). Also, 6 for a bottle of water I get better deals at movie theaters...In conclusion, if you're looking to be in Chicago on a budget, want to be in a good location, and only plan to use the hotel to sleep at night, then the Freehand might be for you. Just make sure to keep an eye on your bank account.Hello Jade Y, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am glad your stay was mostly enjoyable. I am sorry to hear, however, that the room was a little stuffy. I hope this will not stop you from returning in the future. I am also sorry you had a billing error. While I am glad the front desk took care of the issue, I am sorry to hear that it was incorrect. I hope you will consider returning to Freehand again in the future.",Neutral

"It's now called the Budget Host Inn. Signs for the Tombstone Motel have been taken down. Not a bad place to stay considering where it is located, Tombstone, AZ. An older facility, it is across the street from downtown Tombstone, easy walk. Parking is tight. Room was very clean, everything worked okay. King bed was a bit soft but doable.... More",Neutral
"Although the accommodations were nice, the service and amenities weren't up to the standard you'd expect at a JW Marriott. Specifically -- when we reserved our room we indicated 4 guests, but on arrival were assigned a room with 1 king bed. The first staffer we spoke with was very unaccommodating. After speaking with a different staffer, we were able to change to a room with a king bed + sofa pull out. Unfortunately we found that room had no linens and it took 3 calls to the front desk to have them delivered. Lastly, the air in our room didn't work well and it stayed warm throughout our visit. I did, however, find the valet staff and the Nox grille staff to be very attentive. The breakfast buffet at Nox was delicious. This hotel has the makings of a wonderful luxury hotel, but needs a bit more attention to some of these finer details. Thank you for your visit and review. I am disappointed to learn about your service failures as we pride ourselves in providing outstanding services and exceeding our guests expectations. The service you received is not typical for the JW Marriott Atlanta. I do hope that you will feel free to contact me directly so that I can personally discuss your visit in more detail. In the meantime, you can be certain that I have personally followed up with our team on your comments. I do hope we can regain your trust and confidence and visit again. Thank you for letting us know.",Neutral
"I stayed here for 4 nights with 2 other people, and overall, it was a good place to stay for a trip to Universal. I have only one complaint: the air conditioner in the room. First, it was LOUD, which was very annoying at night. Secondly, we had a double room, and the bed closest to the unit is very close and is directly in the path of the cold air. I slept on this bed the first night and froze, I slept here on the second night and woke up with a terrible sore throat, which really sucked all the next day in the park. Other than that, everything else was fine. The hotel is clean, the heated pool and hot tub was great at the end of each day when you're really sore from all the walking in the park. The free shuttle and breakfast was also extremely helpful. The traffic in the area is crazy at night, but there's lots of restaurants, pharmacies, etc. in the area.",Neutral
"While this Courtyard touts itself as being Union Square, it really isn't that close to Union Sq. It is walking distance to Union Sq., Chinatown and other sights, but not a block or 2 away. Our room, 708, was quiet. The rooms are small the bathroom has a motion detector which is great when you get up in the middle of the night, but not a great idea when you're taking a shower! Every couple of minutes, you have to stick your arm outside the shower curtain and wave in order to turn on the light again. Funny, but annoying. Speaking of the shower, the water is hot and the pressure is strong. The room has a small fridge breakfast is available for purchase.Linda F - Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor. I realize that The Courtyard San Francisco Union Square is in somewhat of a unique location though we hope that our customer care was nothing short of your expectations when staying with Marriott and Courtyard hotels. While we are still less than a year old, we have found need to redesign the bathrooms and this will begin at the beginning of next year and I am sure you will be pleased with the refreshed product. If you do have travel plans back to San Francisco, I would like for you to contact me directly so I can assist you with your reservations. I appreciate your feedback.",Neutral
"I did the research on Tripadvisor and I must say it was exactly what people reported. It is within walking distance to all the restaurants and shops, the property is beautiful and well maintained with vibrant floral landscaping, tile stairways and wonderful seating areas. It is a bit of a maze, but this makes the property very fun to explore and if you are stair adverse you can easily navigate the property by elevator. We stayed in building 6 in room 641 top floor at the end of the building, nice size room. The room was dated but the bed was comfortable. Microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker are nice amenities. There was a sitting area with a chair and a small, uncomfortable couch. The carpet at minimum could use a good cleaning, but the rooms really need updating. If you only plan on using the room to crash after a great day of sightseeing this hotel is perfect.",Neutral
"This establishment looks more like a hostel that a hotel. Decor is decadent but charming. Staff is helpful and nice. It is located at a stone's throw from the Fisherman's Wharf. There is a Trader Joe's and a number of cafs and bars nearby. Close to the cable car and bus stops.My room was tiny, just room for a sink and a folding bed. No bathroom but a huge flatscreen TV. Bed was confy. Could hear the neighbour's TV but was so tired that didn't really bothered. Don't miss the massage coach, good experience.Overall I would recommend to stay at this hotel for location and flashback, but it seems a bit overpriced for a room with no bathroom and without breakfast.We have a reputation for being the best budget Hotel in San Francisco. We are located close to many of the most desirable attractions, the Cable Car is only 1 block away from us.Our prime location, 2 blocks from Fishermans Wharf, North Beach, make our Hotel a walkers paradise. San Francisco is known to be an expensive City to visit we make your stay affordable by providing a beautifully decorated Hotel at a budget rate. We are surrounded by Hotels whose rates are are 200 to 300 higher than ours. Yes, our rooms are not large, but neither are our prices.To respect the authenticity and charm of the Hotel, and to minimize noise, we do not offer TVs or telephones in the rooms. We do have an internet kiosk and printer, free Wi-Fi and a TV room for our guests.",Neutral
"I'm going to try to be as positive, kind and impartial as I can in this review because this hotel really could be phenomenal. I'll preface it with a pro/con section if you just want to avoid the whole written story.Hotel Location: Pro - Awesome location for the price Con - NoneCleanliness: Pros- Clean! Bathrooms and linens are clean.Cons - Housekeeping needs to show up for that to happen, which is no guaranteeRooms: Pros - Comfortable beds, clean linens, clean bathroom, modern bathroom, microwave, mini-fridge, spaciousCons - Some rooms much more spacious than others and you can get TERRIBLE viewsStaff: Pros - Helpful, if you get the right ones.Cons - Two were helpful. The others were as unhelpful as possible, even refusing to answer phones despite no other customers around. And one seemed kinda homophobic. It can feel like pulling teeth to get the most basic request fulfilled - a first experience of that kind.Breakfast: Pros - Really, really delicious. Fantastic coffee and delivered right to your room. Worth paying for, but comes free!Cons - It's like pulling teeth to get that breakfast slip and you may get a subpar, put together last minute breakfast. Parking: Pro - Cheaper than other valet services at hotels in NOLA. Takes the stress out of finding parking. Con - No self-park option available. They crashed my car causing a lot of damage. Hotel Value : Pro - Fantastic. Clean beds, reasonable sized rooms, really good location, complementary small breakfast.Con: If you're unlucky you may not get all of these things they promise/advertise, which lowers the value some. Experience:We booked this hotel same day as we were road tripping around the US and decided to stop in NOLA for the weekend. Expedia had a good rate on it, and it had fantastic reviews.Upon checking in the woman at the front desk was busy, a little tired, but friendly. However, her tone noticeably changed when she tried to double check that we wanted a single king bed. As a same sex young married couple, but we're discreet and get that question often. People are just double checking that we prefer that, but we've never had a really negative reaction in any country, city or state we've ever travelled to (even Turkey). This woman became pretty frosty and really...short with us immediately after. I couldn't figure out what I said to cause it, as, like I said, even if people don't like it, they're usually professional and just give us a room. I can't guarantee that THAT was what made this woman take a disliking to us, but we said or did something to get on her bad side quickly and boy did it stick! We got a single queen room on the second floor near to the emergency exit. The room was very spacious, for the price and very clean. Other people have said the beds felt really saggy and worn, but ours was really, really comfortable. The microwave was a really useful addition to the room and a coffee maker is always appreciated. The only weird part was that there was a welcome card sitting on the desk addressed to Mr. And Mrs. Thomas, or something, welcoming them to the hotel and the coffee maker had been used. I guess it was their room originally. Of additional note was our view - of which there was none. More specifically - it was of a brick wall a couple of feet away. We thought nothing of it when first arriving, but later found it to be strange as it has to be the worst view in the hotel. We noticed, same day when housekeeping was still cleaning rooms, or just generally had the doors open (I have no clue why) that not only were a majority of the rooms empty, but they had much better views and were almost double the size of ours. I have no idea why that room was picked for us, but it was.In regards to breakfast, they have a really fantastic set-up when it is fully put into place. You get complimentary fresh croissants and coffee or orange juice delivered to your room at the time of your choosing in the morning (between 6-10, or something similar). When we got up to our room the first time we called asking about the breakfast slip the front desk lady said would be waiting. She answered saying that it was in the drawer. We checked all of them and said it wasn't there. She said again that it was and hung up. Riiiight. We went downstairs when leaving to go to the French Quarter and asked the male desk guy about the breakfast slip and he said it was in the drawer. We said it wasn't, and he said housekeeping would give us one and that they put a new one in every day. Mind you, the stipulation of the complimentary breakfast was that you had to put the slip out by 10pm. Upon returning at midnight there was still no slip. Now, it's not the end of the World if I don't get the croissant, I don't really care, but it's kind of annoying if they offer it. We went back down and asked a different desk lady if we could get a breakfast slip. She replied, oh, of course! and grabbed one from a pile sitting under the desk. I don't fully understand why nobody else would give us one when they were sitting right there. Maybe it really was a housekeeping job. I don't know. So, we got breakfast in the morning, checking that others in our hallway has them still hanging and that they hadn't been collected. About four did, including the room two doors down. In the morning, we got our croissants and coffee only for them to be kinda hard and average coffee pre-made in coffee cups. Honestly, I didn't expect anything different so it was really nice. However, when we put our tray outside I noticed that everyone else (the other 4) had carafe looking coffee pots and slightly different plate/tray set up. Weird. Whatever. We get back after sightseeing to find we don't have a breakfast slip. Again. And our used coffee (which was used before we got there) still hasn't been replaced. We call down and speak to the initial lady who checked us in. She got a little angry and said housekeeping leaves the breakfast slips, that it's in the drawer and said we would have to order coffee on our breakfast slip they don't do room service. I told her I was misunderstood, we just wanted housekeeping to replace our coffee for the coffee maker, but then she asked why we needed coffee in the room if we just ordered it on the slip for breakfast. I said I would really appreciate having the option to make it at other times. Either way she told me shed send housekeeping and didn't. Later, before dinner, I realised I didn't grab my bag with my stomach medication when checking in the previous night. We went downstairs and asked the woman, who was the one that checked us in and already hung up on us twice, if we could have valet grab our car. She said no, they would only be able to go into our car and grab it. I said okay, but that it might be tough to find. I offered to walk to the lot and she said this was not permitted. She then pulled out a list with a bunch of crossed out customer requests on top, and added us to the other two new requests on the bottom. I knew it was busy and gave it about 40 minutes. Still nothing. My wife called down and asked if they could also grab her shoes while they were there, and if we could get that coffee for our coffee maker. Spathe same desk lady said yes. We waited another hour, and another hour after that. We waited a total of three hours for valet to bring my stomach medication so I could have dinner. At this point it was 9:30pm. We went back downstairs and the same desk lady declared, with slightly feigned surprise, 'oh, you haven't received your items.' I said no, that we were probably still on her list because she hadn't called about them arriving. She looked at the list, of which there were others listed below us, and everything was crossed out but ours. She said shed take care of it. Suddenly, 10 minutes later, they pulled the vehicle up, something she said was impossible before. I got my pills, gave the keys back and (stupidly) didn't tip because I was grumpy waiting for my car for 3 hours. On the way back up to the room my wife spotted a random housekeeping cart near the elevator and nabbed a breakfast slip, as we still didn't get one. She just got tired of asking and calling 4 times a day.Our breakfast, the next morning, was completely different from the day before. Delicious, fresh croissants. A metal carafe of fantastic coffee. Fresh pressed orange juice. It was a night and day difference from the day before. It was so good I would have actually paid extra for it! We checked out Monday morning after a really great weekend spent in the French quarter, and sightseeing. We waited, again, an unusually long time for the valet (over an hour) before a young 17/18yr old kid delivered it to us. The car had been crashed into a pole and had a busted up fender and broken trunk.The rest is overly boring detail involving the police, having to stay an extra night in New Orleans, and being left with 3k worth of damage.We remained shockingly polite throughout it, though I have no idea why. I guess I couldn't blame the young kid, he didn't do it and it was terrible his boss sent him instead of coming himself. I couldn't be angry at the desk girl, someone I hadn't even seen before she didn't do it either. I asked if my valet fee could be refunded, as nobody had offered yet. She said said and was trying to be very help, only to double charge us, instead of refunding it (we would find out the next day). We ended up having to drive cross-country with a broken trunk and body damage to my vehicle in order to get back home quickly. The rest of our vacation plans had to be cancelled and the weekend stay racked up a tab of nearly 3500, between the hotel, double charged valet and vehicle repairs. I will give credit to the manager, whom was very cooperative and, as I pretty much cried to her in frustration, made sure our stay and valet were refunded, and vehicle repairs covered. I've got a really biased review, and there were a lot of things that were problematic with the hotel, even before the crash. I understand that sometimes you have bad luck and a bad experience, which I normally totally understand. And, despite all this, I MIGHT still consider staying here or recommending others if they got their act together (but not valet, obviously). The valet isn't the hotel (but it is their only parking option). They were really exceptional at times, but really difficult at others. The location is great, the price really competitive, but there was a serious undertone of homophobia (the first time in my life I've ever experienced that) from one particular desk lady, combined with general incompetence from either housekeeping or the desk people.Dear Iselin,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a thorough review. I appreciate you detailing the good experiences as well as the bad. Here at the St. James, we have zero tolerance for homophobia. The city of New Orleans and the St. James prides itself on welcoming all walks of life with open arms so I am very disappointed that his was this experience that you had. I sincerely apologize for the lack of consistency with the service during your stay and can't thank you enough for reporting all of your issues. As you mentioned in your review, we did have a brief encounter regarding the damages to your car by our valet. I would like to apologize again for this inconvenience. Since your stay, I have had a meeting with our valet company about how these issues should be handled in the future should they arise. Once again, I appreciate your feedback and I hope if you are ever find yourself back in New Orleans you will give us another chance to provide you with the supreme customer service I know that we are capable of. Please contact me directly. Warm Regards",Neutral

"I was little worried about Hotel Abri at first. Its prices were much less than surrounding hotels which made me skeptical. However, immediately upon arrival, it was obvious that the hotel was just fine. The gift bag at check-in was a nice touch (especially the full-size bottle of whine). I had read the reviews and read about the gift bag, but I just assumed it included it one of those little whine bottles and a few other things. The room was small, but not any smaller than I would have expected for what was most likely an old apartment building turned hotel room. And definitely no smaller than 90 of the apartments you'd see in Manhattan. Despite the size of the room, it was well-appointed and had a decent size bathroom and shower. The rooms had window AC/heat units, but they were thermostatically controlled, which was nice (instead of just being a thru-wall unit with a speed knob. The morning breakfast bag left a lot to be desired (as compared to a standard continental breakfast), but it was better than nothing. They also give you coupons to the restaurant that connects to the lobby. We didn't get the chance to eat there, but it looked nice. Anyhow, there wasn't anything overwhelmingly fantastic about the hotel, not was there really anything bad. It was a nice launching bad for our activities for a long weekend. We walked to ATT Park for the Giants game (not far), and the cable car stop was only a few blocks away (as well as all of the shopping). Likewise, Enterprise retail car was just one block away (this came in handy because we rented a car to drive to Sonoma). All in all, a good experience, decent hotel, helpful and kind staff we would stay here again Fo Sho!Hello Matt B, thank you for your feedback.

"I stayed here for 2 nights in July 2013.I originally made my booking through the Adelaide Hostel online and requested a private room.When I arrived at the Adelaide Hostel, I was greeted by one of the staff who was outside having a smoke. (The hostel is at the end of a short dirty alleyway with mostly rubbish bins on the street. It smells, looks and feels seedy) Having arrived at 10AM I was super early for the standard 3PM check in for a private room. She guided me across the road to store my bags. I asked her for directions to the closest train station. She fired off street names and intersections at me like I was a local and then went off. Completely useless. I quite literally just flew into San Fran and had told her it was my first time! Not impressed.Having come back at 3PM for check in I was told that the private rooms are a 5 minute walk away at another hotel. The gentleman at reception was really not friendly or helpful. I grabbed my bags and walked uphill with 2 x 23Kg bags to Post street. Crossed over and walked about 1 minute to the Fitzgerald Hotel.The check in staff couldn't didn't my booking but somehow found me a room! 5 minutes of humming and being a bit flustered by the check in girl. I was surprised that I had to pay for my whole stay up-front! Very strange. I was given room 204. Its the room above reception. The elevator is super old and small and smelly and dirty. Moving bags up in this was not easy.The room was clean but super small. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. The decor was circa 1980's B-grade movie style. The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and there were stray hairs all over the place. The bathroom was practical though. Oh, apart from the bathroom door being like a patio door. It was completely see through glass! So when my friend joined me on day 2 for 1 night, one of us had to leave the room so we didn't have to see the other doing the dirty deed! The room was not cheap either. Its USD 140 incl tax per night. This is cheap-ish in San Fran but not in general.The worst part The staff. ALL the staff I spoke with were really unhelpful and it felt like I was being a right royal nuisance every time I asked them something. I wasn't asking stupid questions either - practical questions like the best airport shuttle or the closest good quality diner. The real winner - was when I went down to reception at midnight to ask if someone could replace my in-room phone as it wasn't working and had to call overseas urgently. The guy there was so rude and so abrupt. He actually sighed and threw his laptop when I asked him to check my room phone or permit me to use the lobby phone. When he realized the phone was broken he apologized and let me use the lobby phone.The only good things about this hotel: (1) wifi is quick and reliable. (2) the location is handy to cafes, restaurants and public transport.",Neutral
"We had 4 adults and 1 child (age 7). This was our grandchild's first trip away from home. Room 120 is marketed as a suite. It's not. It's a regular hotel room with 2 queen size beds and then a closet with a full size bed inside of it. I kid you not!The grandparents (us) wanted a seperate bedroom so we were stuck in the closet. There was not enough room for 2 adults to walk around in the room. You open the door and there's the bed. There was 6 from the edge of the opened door to the edge of the bed. The bed was up against the wall. There was one tv in the entire suite. That tv was outside of the closet bedroom. There was one side table lamp in the suite and that was not in the closet bedroom. The closet bedroom had a floor lamp on the opposite side of the closet from the bed and a blaring overhead light. There was just enough room in the closet bedroom to open one piece of luggage. There was a very small side table in the closet bedroom where one could put their clothes in...a bit tough if there's 2 adults in the closet bedroom staying 4 nights. What little carpet you were exposed to in the closet bedroom was sticky as though someone had spilled a soft drink by the side table.Had we known this we never would've booked here. Thus the reason for me writing to help other guests.The staff was extremely nice. We had rented a scooter and that was left in the hotel lobby overnight as none of the hotel rooms on the property would be able to accomodate a scooter. We were provided with plenty of clean towels in the one small bathroom in our suite.The pool was very clean.The breakfast consisted of frozen donuts (no microwave is available in the lobby eating area...if you wanted them heated up you had to take it to your room and use your microwave there), powdered scrambled eggs, bagels, small yogurts, a few pieces of fruit, milk, juice and coffee. Cereals were available from the bulk cereal dispenser and there was a waffle maker. The breakfast area was tiny. Since we stayed here from Oct 23 - Oct 27 there weren't a bunch of families to battle with in this breakfast area. I can not even fathom eating in the breakfast area during summer vacation, spring break, or during the holiday season when multiple families are in abundance. The seating consisted of 4 tables...2 tables accomodated 4 people and 2 tables accomodated 2 people (12 people total in the seating area). Of note, since this was something we had never experienced in any other hotels we've stayed in over a 40+ year span, there were two police vehicles parked outside the lobby with officers in the lobby that started one of our mornings off before heading to the Happiest Place on Earth. We didn't want to know what may have happened for their being there but the officers weren't there to partake in the breakfast, if you catch my drift.Parking was adequate and free. The maids like to trash talk about the guests in Spanish. This might be ok for persons who aren't Spanish-fluent, but we are. There's a sand pit playground area in the courtyard. It seemed to be in good repair. Our grandson didn't play in the area. I can't speak for any noise level this may cause in the rooms that surround the courtyard.Don't say you weren't warned. You get what you pay for. And no, we would never stay here again.",Neutral

"We stayed in the Annex, and the room and bathroom were both small. The room we had, one of the beds appeared to be broken. At the very least, the headboard was broken. However, it was has a nice location on the boardwalk, although slightly far from what appears to be the heart of it. Staff was friendly, food was decent, which was nice as the package we had included a food voucher and parking.One thing I still don't understand is why there was a pole (to support the ceiling perhaps) on the side of one of the beds. This massive pole, maybe 2.5 ft. by 2.5 ft., right where my head could hit if I weren't careful waking up in the morning. They should find a way to do something about this.Staff was very friendly and helpful. If you're just looking for a place to sleep while in AC, it's not a bad choice.",Neutral

"Hi, Checked into this hotel near Philadelphia Int'l. Airport. This hotel is clean and modern, and the staff is very friendly There is also a Marriott Courtyard nearby (maybe a block away) where I have stayed several times before. The Courtyard is just a little more expensive but more comfortable and nicer with more amenities. Worth the extra money in my opinion. Otherwise, this is an ok place to stay if you are trying to keep expenses down.Hi,Thank you for making us your choice hotel while staying in the Philadelphia area.

"Like everyone else says, this is a hotel for those on a budget. The pictures of the hotel are a bit misleading, including those showing the insides and pool etc. However, once you navigate your way around what is essentially a block of flats, the rooms are a pleasant surprise and are actually the best part of the hotel. Making your own breakfast loses its appeal after 1 day, especially when the cereal machines werent working and the staff on duty dont really understand english too well. however, you are close to many of the 3/4.99 breakfast buffets so its not really a problem. we were dismayed to find how easily the staff coud get assess to the safes in your room after our battery ran out and they took nearly 45mins to come up to our room (after repeated warning that we were in a hurry). as i said, the room is great though and we weren't really affected by loud crowds. if you want great service and english speaking (as a first language), don't stay here but if you don't mind it for the amount of time you'll be in room, it'l do just fine. free wifi as well. just remembered....the day we checked out and left our luggage in the 'secure' area, we got the feeling that it wasn't so as the hotel employed no way of identifying your bag so anyone could have lifted ours but thankfully we had locks.",Neutral

"Great location,and its nice to have the extra room. We've ben using this hotel since they opened, and unfortunately it's starting to show wear tear.It could use some TLC. The lighting is really bad, and the rooms are in need of new linens,mattresses,and household items.",Neutral
"First of all we actually picked wrong location thinking where we had stayed previously. The other was at another exit. However, we checked in and went to our room and started to settle in. At some point in the evening my wife went to her side of the bed. There was a substance like a gel on the glass table by the bed. She pulled a Kleenex and wiped it all of. She plugged in phone/Ipad for charging and in moving away from bed noticed a condom wrapper on the floor. We decided to just deal with it. My wife told the girl at the front desk when we were going out to dinner. She offered to move us, but at our age it was more trouble than it was worth. We just explained that perhaps they should let cleaning staff responsible for that room that day of the findings. Was really surprised and disappointed.

I was in Seattle for business and stayed at this hotel. I work for a start-up so we don't have huge expense accounts and price is something we look out for. This was the cheapest place in the City and it was really easy for me to get downtown. They were fast in calling me a cab when I needed it and friendly when I asked about restaurants in the area. The rooms are a little dated but hey-you get what you pay for so I can't really complain. It was a clean and decent place. I will stay here again when I'm back.,Neutral

it was my last hotel in serious of three during 11 day trip from san francisco so i can compare to few others. the room itself was OK. 2 twin beds that were a little bit small but no surprise there. the bath was fine but the weird thing is that the sink and counter space is outside the bathroom. another weird thing is a full mirror wall on the side of the bed...the walls are very very thin. i felt like the people in the room next door were talking to me. luckily we weren't in the room most of the time but still... the hotel is an open motel kind of space which is nice and has a warm pool at night with steaming water so that's fun. the location at hotel circle is great. close to a lot of things in san diego and i don't think we drove over 1-2 exits in the highway to any of the other attractions. just across the road is the fashion valley mall with a lot of stores and good restaurants if you need to rest.,Neutral
"I had a very pleasant 2 night stay at the diva- if given the choice I would give it 3.5 as I think it was better than average. I chose the hotel for its close location to union square and it's value price compared to a lot of other hotels in the area. Whether this hotel is for you really depends on what you want..I stayed one night in the Hilton parc 55 which had a lot more amenities and the 'posh ' vibe and then moved to the cheaper hotel diva as I couldn't afford 3 nights in the Hilton. I actually prefered the diva because of its great location and found the service in the diva a lot better than the Hilton. The diva bed was also more comfy than the Hilton and overall I felt the diva was much better value. If you are looking for value and a good location then this hotel is for you, if you want a grand hotel with a lot of amenities with a view to spending a lot of time in the hotel itself, then the Hilton would be more up your street.

"I spent one night in Aloft in a business trip. The hotel is in a central location in downtown Atlanta. The price is very good. The heavy concrete look is predominant at the lobby area, which I didn't like. The room was fine and had everything I need in a room. I asked about dinner at the front desk when I checked in and they told me that I can either eat at their lobby bar or order from one (only one!) restaurant they would allow in so I should look at the menu in my room. There was no menu in the room. I called the front desk and when they finally were persuaded that I don't have that book with a white cover in my room they said they will send someone with the menu. I am still waiting... The next night I stayed at the W hotel. I paid 25 more and got much more... Aloft would not be high on my list next time I travel to Atlanta.Thank you for taking the time to complete the Guest Satisfaction Survey in regards to your recent stay at the Aloft Atlanta Downtown.

"Second year I have stayed at this hotel. I have business in the area and it is convenient for me. Morning free breakfast is very good, hot, fresh and a large selection. Typical motel setting with free parking. Bed was very comfortable. I wasn't happy with the cleanliness this visit. My white socks were pretty dirty after walking around in the room. On check out I told them of 2 issues I felt needed to be resolved. They made a note of that. 2nd day, I returned to my room at 10 p.m. and housekeeping didn't freshen my room. Upon checkout I told the Front Desk, and they said, If you have a Do Not Disturb sign on your door at 9 a.m., they by-pass your room and don't come back. When I told them I removed the sign at 10:15 a.m. when I went to work for the day, Front Desk basically said, that's their policy. I find that policy totally inconsiderate. Next time in the area, I will seek another hotel.Thank you for providing us with your feedback and choosing to return to our property. I do apologize for the inconvenience you experience during your time with us. I do recall you mentioning at checkout that you had a DND sign on the door and removing it sometime after 10:15 am and I explained that housekeeping will not service room with DND sign but housekeeping do return later in the day and service rooms that have removed DND sign. I wish you would have brought to my attention about the carpet being dirty so I could have given you an upgraded room or offered some type of compensation. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.

"My husband and I enjoyed staying at your hotel except for one thing: bed sheets and linen. I noticed that the linen were not replaced with new sheets. At first I tried to ignore it but then when I was getting ready to sleep that was when I felt something itchy on my left leg and when I checked it, I noticed some red small dots on my skin. It started to itch the moment I sat on the bed. And also, I watched your housekeeping staff how she cleaned the room: she did not vacuum the floor, did not change the bed sheets and not really properly cleaned the whole room.Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your most recent stay at our property. I would like to start by apologizing for the inconveniences you faced during your time with us. As far as the sheets being changed in the room, the sheets are only changed every 3 days unless there is a different guest being checked in or if it is requested. After a guest is to check out housekeeping does inspect every room for bbs, so I do apologize if there was any concern for them. I wish that I had been notified of this before you checked out that way we could have further investigated whether it was something like bbs or if it could have been our fabric softener.

"I recently stay at this hotel the weekend before Thanksgiving, and I had a few problems. I believe the best way for a hotel to do better is to let them know whats wrong. Overall I thought the hotel was nice and the staff was very helpful and this is good. There were a few hiccups, but I would probably stay again. (only if they fix the problems below)When I arrived Saturday afternoon, after my 4 hour drive, I really wanted to sit in the hot tub. I was told that it was not open due to some maintenance that needed to be done on both the pool and hot tub. I then tried to go into the hot tub the next morning and again was told it was not open and that it might be open later in the afternoon. I came back Sunday evening and it was raining, but the hot tub was finally open. So I sat in there while the rain came down and hit my face (not good and not long). Next I noticed the hotel had very nice flat screen T.V.'s in all the rooms that my family occupied. There was also HBO booklets next to the T.V.'s....only one problem. They did not have HBO or premium channels until the following weekend.. So I had to sit in a room with basic cable and no HBO or even the FX or History Channel. The breakfast was ok, but after the 2nd day I ate off site. The eggs were really watery and the sausage was as dry as beef jerky. The Orange Juice machine seemed to get worse each day, and on my third day it was like orange water. The elevator was extremely slow, and I think I could have walked up to my third floor faster. The elevators needed to be faster.",Neutral

"First the positives. I was in the new building which was just across the side street from the main building. The view was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was a little kitchenette for heating food at night. However the down sides were that the porch by the water was like a fire escape landing and people could go up and down the stairs. No privacy and can't keep door open at night to listen to the water. The room is pretty small for the price. The breakfast buffer wax excellent as wax the beautiful courtyard right near it. No room service any other time so plan accordingly. The bathroom was so small that two people could not fit in it. The staff were extremely friendly and the location is what you pay for.

We spent four nights in the hotel during our last stay in SF. The location was perfect - close to the train and walking distance (we walk a lot) to many places that were of interest.

"After seeing the reviews, I was hopeful this hotel was cheap but good. We stayed for one night. So, I'm going to mention the things to work on and then what I liked, because you never end on a bad note. :-)Things that didn't quite meet my expectations:-I had booked for 4 people, there were only 3 towels. Since we arrived late, I really didn't want to bother with chasing down another towel.-the breakfast had bread to toast and bagels and dry cereal. The waffle maker looked like it had been used one too many times, as a customer was trying to chip off his waffle off the griddle. There were empty slots, like pastries or something was there, but they must have been out. There were apples, but one of ours was rotten (not their fault), but added to my annoyance.-the breakfast area had only 2 tables. Guess you are suppose to eat in your room-the a/c unit was about 3 feet from the end of the bed, so kept blowing on us - I had to turn it off and just endure the heat.-The room we had had two queen beds and a walk way from the door to the bathroom. not that roomy.-wifi was horrible on the side of the hotel facing the freeway. I couldn't connect even though they gave me a code.The good:-clean-good front desk service-cheap-microwave-refrigerator-bed was comfy w/ square pillows, so not very big (my preference is for rectangle).-parking in front of your room.FYI - You get lots of freeway noise.Personally, I won't stay here again - but if you just need a place to park your head for the night, I would say it is fine, but please lower your expectations.",Neutral

"I've had to go to San Francisco a lot for business recently and I've been trying many hotels around Union Square.Kensington Park Hotel was the best value for the time I was staying this time.Upon arrival, I realised that this was an old hotel. It wasn't poorly but it was just dated. The lady behind the counter was nice and I checked in relatively quickly.I was on the 6th floor and the room was surprisingly nice. The bed was big and comfortable and a big TV with three big windows. The bathroom was your typical white tile bathroom but it was tasteful also. Even though I was right by the elevators, it was very quiet.I didn't try the food or the theatre so I cannot comment.One problem was that you really had to slam the door shut. The latch was quite stiff so trying to let it shut on its own was not going to happen. For the first night, I returned to find my door ajar as I didn't close it hard enough.For another couple of days, the elevator was out of action so I walked up to my room. An unusual eclectic mix of carpets!Overall, it was comfortable. Given the location, it's good value and well maintained if nothing to shout about.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I will bring the issue to our engineer department in regards the door. We hope you will choose Kensington Park Hotel for your next stay in San Francisco. Warm regards,",Neutral
"First impression was not good,a temporary entrance what looked like a bedroom being used as a reception and as you looked up the hallway you could see electrical cables crossing the hallway and thick card taped to one side going down to the elevators.We could see as we walked to the elevators workmen in what would be the reception area.The elevator that arrived(there were two) was cloaked inside with blue quilted fabric over what looked like thick card,which also covered the floor,we later realised the workmen used this lift so there must be renovations going on on the 2nd floor.The bedroom and shower room looked as if they had been renovated no scuff marks anywhere and the tiling in the shower room looked brand new.The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size.Breakfast was collect your food in the one temporary room and take to another temporary room across the hall,with all of four tables.If both toasters were in use and someone used the microwave then the electric would trip.It was a standard,perfectly ok selection including bananas and patties in buns to microwave.There are no safes in the rooms so as advised by the notice posted on the door we asked at reception for a safety deposit box,sorry but the key is broken but if you wish you can put your valuables in with the hotels money,unbelievable!The swimming pool was off limits as the workmen were using that space.Having said all this the room was nice the bed was very comfortable and the staff were very pleasant,and Rickiea was extremely helpful in finding a resolution.I imagine once all the work is completed it will look good,but I would check beforehand.Why did we stay you may wonder,weel we had been travelling in all 16 hrs and we didn't want to go looking for another hotel and we only were staying for three nights.",Neutral

Went back down to he office to get it corrected - one clerk said there were no other rooms, and the second got us what we paid for. Rooms are dated but clean, hallway noise can get excessive.

The ac unit under the window had to be turned down to 64, it kept going on and off at a higher level and it got stuffy.

Everything else was rather nice, I'm just rather particular.Dear josepht474,Thank you for staying at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. We appreciate you sharing your experience with us. Direct feedback from our customers, both good and bad is the most valuable advice we can receive. It helps us to recognize our areas of challenges and make the appropriate adjustments where necessary.

"I went there with my BFFL and she fell in love with it after 3 seconds... I'm still trying to warm up to it. It had the cozy, heartwarming and pittoresque appeal, But when the first love ended you stood there short of Oxytocin and felt the cramped space that minutes before seemed enough. The Window in the room that seemed so corky at first, facing the corridor outside the room to small to let enough oxygen into the room at night. And the wash basin in the corridor that was sooo 19th century be actually a way of the past. The bed was adequate but a tad to small for more than newlyweds. I will not do this ho(s)tel again. But my roomy she would wanna be buried there!Thank you for your honest review. In an era of selfishness and cynicism, close quarter and having to share your space, let alone your thoughts with someone else, could be daunting. But life 100 years ago was not all about yourself.We are a beautifully preserved historic hotel, where many romantic stories, honeymoons and weddings have been celebrated. Notwithstanding our old world layout and style, we stand decade after decade, 11 total. This year we are celebrating our 110 anniversary, and that is cause for much Oxytocin!!",Neutral
"We coud't get into our room, so after two visits to reception there was an engineer sent up and we eventually got in, we also had bother with the cold tap birling round this was also reported to reception, then we never got any replacement towels, ok an honest mistake but lastly the rooms at the back of the hotel suffer from a really noisy outside fan which takes a couple of days to get used to.",Neutral
"This hotel is in a great location, staff is helpful and friendly. The in room breakfast was nice. The only down side is the walls are thin so its very noisy. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were very flat. I had to stack up 3 of them. We didn't get much sleep during our stay.",Neutral
"Checked in here last week for two nights. Booked in advance a two queen bed room for myself, husband, and five year old daughter. Our normal hotel we stay at in Anaheim was sold out already (close to Thanksgiving) so we went with the Del Sol Inn since it's also equally close to the park.And that's the best part. You can walk to the parks in about five minutes even if you just miss the light to cross Harbor Blvd.!When checking in I was greeted the following way: Hi, can I help youYes, I have a reservation, insert name hereOh, I've been dreading you all night.Um, ok...Yeah, we don't have any more two bed rooms, so I have to give you a king with a roll-away, but don't worry, we won't charge you for the roll-away.Really It's only 8pm and I made this reservation months agoSorry.So then we go to park and of course there's no parking. We're assured that Valet is free, but you have to tip.The room is okay. Clean, up to date, AC/Heat worked fine.The roll-away arrives and it's horrible. My five year old refused to sleep on it and I didn't blame her one bit, it was really lumpy in some areas and hard in others, so then we shared a bed for two nights.Free Wifi wasn't consistent, but worked okay about 75 of the time.We didn't try the breakfast.All the hotels in this area have noise issues so I'm not knocking them at all for that.It was nice to have a fridge in the room.That's about it. I mean, I'd stay here again if I had to, but I'd rather go back to one of the other properties on Harbor that at least had enough parking and gave me the room I reserved.",Neutral

"Just stayed here and really enjoyed the hotel. It has a lot of unique charm to offer. It is not your standard hotel ... only those who like something a little different will appreciate this hotel. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The layout of my two bedroom was fun (meaning it wasn't the typical layout - two beds side by side). It was more like two separate rooms adjoined by a door. Overall I really like this unique and charming hotel - would stay again. I really enjoyed the location too.We really appreciate you taking a moment to share your experience. It's always nice to hear when a guest has had a positive experience and appreciates the charm of our inn. I'll be sure to share your kind words with our staff.

"The hotel staff was friendly and engaging. The property appeared recently renovated and well kept up. You need to be prepared for the surrounding neighborhood. it's 100 feet from some of the sketchiest places you ever want to see. Not one but two strip clubs, a couple of adult bookstores and of course, the obligatory massage parlor beneath the bails bondsman. None of this is the hotels fault and I would certainly rate them higher if the neighborhood was a little nicer.Good day Carver123,Thank you for sharing your experience with our team. We are glad you found our team to be friendly and engaging. We are sorry to hear of your challenges with the surrounding area. While there is little our team can do to improve the surrounding area, we are certainly empathetic to your concerns and appreciate your feedback. We hope to see you again very soon.

"Without a doubt the Comfort Suites location, room size and housekeeping are all A1, however we were somewhat disappointed with the staff's knowledge, actual room facilities and the breakfast.Staff were not that familiar with basic questions about the area and indeed gave incorrect information. Such basic information as to shuttle buses to the airport was met with - you can look it up online as was our enquiry about the hop on- hop off tour. Our room also did not have the advertised washer dryer and when we approached the front desk - we were asked 3 times whether we were sure that there was none in the room (sadly we do know what a washer/dryer looks like) and then told that they are upgrading washer dryers on floor 11 - mixed messages!Finally the breakfast was disappointing - at 8.30am - all out of hot food and at 6.30am a fairly limited choice. All in all - a very average stay.Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations with our breakfast and staff service. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you provided to make improvements to ensure we offer an exceptional experience for our guests in the future. If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me at the property. I hope that you will consider staying with us again when you are next in Chicago so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.With Warm Regards,Natalie Furka-PadgettGeneral Manager",Neutral
I booked a room for two we was accused of having a third person staying in the room.Which was a freind who came to our room to visit who lives in atlanta so we had to pay a extra fee which was crazy.Also the men at the check in desk was rude middle easterns with bad attitudes but later became nice when they found i live in the city same they use to live in when they lived in the los angeles area.The location is great our orginal price was a good deal until they charged us extra for a third person with that price we could have went to a better hotel.,Neutral
"Our stay would have been great without the strong smell of air freshener. We stayed for 2 nights and asked not to have our room cleaned and the smell was still strong when we would return to our room. Other than that the hotel is nice, the bed is great and parking is included. The breakfast was very good with hot items. and a variety of fruit to add to our oatmeal (though it would have been nice to have hot oatmeal and not the packets). I would have rated it higher if not for the air freshener.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay! I'm sorry you did not enjoy the air freshener we use at the property. I will pass that feedback along to my manager. I'm glad you enjoyed the rest of your stay, though! We do sometimes have hot oatmeal as a breakfast option. We use the packets if the breakfast attendant has made grits. That is my favorite part about our breakfast--it is different every morning!We hope to see you the next time you visit New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager",Neutral

"Its not easy to get a GOOD hotel ON Bourbon street. This is one of them, but you'll pay a price, of course.The rooms are not large, but comfortable enough. The bathroom was so tiny that they had to split the door so it could open. One lamp wouldn't light, but we managed without it. Otherwise it was maintained well enough.We booked a standard King room, but they ran out and HAD to give us a balcony room. I'm very glad that happened, since the balcony made a BIG difference. Even being on the street (albeit on the third floor) the room was quiet enough to sleep without bein bothered by the noise outside - which was considerable. The balconies are semi-private, so you need to lock your doors at night and when you leave. We were there during Spring Break and the streets were full of partying college-age students. I'm sure this street is full most of the time They have a pool, which we didn't use. The big draw of this hotel is its location, right in the heart of the French Quarter on Bourbon Street. That's what you're paying for. (And so will your car - 35 extra per night)Dear Jim,Thank you for your valuable feedback. We were glad to read you were thoroughly pleased with our location in the heart and soul of New Orleans at the crossroads of Bourbon and Toulouse Streets and that the balcony room made your stay that much more special. We're sorry the bathroom size was a concern for you. We have a selection of room sizes available and will be happy to offer you another option the next time you stay with us.

"I've stayed here at the Astoria Hotel every time I've visited The City except once and I've been visiting on a regular basis since 1986-1987. I stayed once at the Olympic Hotel on Mason Street near the Hilton and the Marriott off of O'Farrell St. The Olympic was on par with the Astoria but was bought out by the Art Institute for dorm space or whatever so it's been the Astoria ever since. I guess if I was a Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt kind of guy I wouldn't mind throwing away 200-250/night just for a place to sleep. Not to compare the two properties obviously but there are many more ways to spending your hard earned vacation money there in San Francisco as any other expensive locale. But maybe I have it all wrong which is a distinct possibility. What is it they say about real estate: location, location, location... At the corner of Grant and Bush next to the Chinatown gate, you couldn't ask for a more convenient location. And for you Starbucks junkies, there's one across the street. And it's cheap and that's one word you'll never hear associated with San Francisco. I guess when I can book r/t airfare and 7 nights at the luxurious Astoria for much less than 1,000, I shouldn't complain. I never pay full fare and if I think rates are high I just won't go, simple as that. But a few simple amenities wouldn't hurt. Like, for instance maybe a couple of microwaves in the community room on the second floor so the guests can warm up some leftover restaurant food or even warm up a cup of coffee for heaven's sake. Don't know how much it would cost to Wi-Fi each floor but the community room has it but I'm sure most guests would prefer the privacy of their own rooms. The breakfast items served on the second floor daily works for something on the run. And how about some vending machines and ice machines. We're not asking the owners to break the bank here but I've talked to a front desk person there who has mentioned these type of amenities to the owners for years and has had no response.But then again who do you think is going to absorb the costs of these added amenities and renovations. Their loyal customers like myself. Maybe if some of us took our business elsewhere they'd get the message. Probably not. Food for thought Astoria Hotel. Is anybody listening there.. I must give a shout out to the hard working housekeeping staff. They do a heck of a job and at least my room has always been clean, or let's say clean enough. And maybe add a few more channels and upgrade the TV's and make sure all the remotes work. Just saying...",Neutral
"Our room -- on the second floor and accessible from the ground floor through a very small elevator -- was fine -- adequate bed and space.

"We were traveling to visit family with two school-age children. We booked the Radisson for two reasons: first, to try a Sleep Number bed because I'd like to convince my better half to buy one, and second, because it had a heated outdoor pool. Now that it's the Hotel Zephyr, both the pool and the sleep number beds are gone. Now it's modern, hip, and trendy - great if you're twentysomething looking for fun, but somewhat less appealing to us old and stodgy thirtysomethings.Had the hotel contacted us in advance, I would've rebooked somewhere else. But since they didn't contact me despite having my phone number, address, and email, we were stuck. The desk clerk was witchy (ma'am, I can't build a Radisson for you) but the front office manager was much kinder, recognizing it does stink to not be aware of the huge change in the hotel's target demographic and style prior to arrival and upgrading us in response.The beds are hard and the rooms are small, but everything was clean, fresh, and new with the recent renovation. The pool area is now a courtyard, the theme of which is actually junk: old shipping containers line the area, the sculptures are flaming old cathode ray tube tv sets, and crumpled aluminum cans are used as decor. Very post-apocalyptic chic. Again, cute if you're 20, but eye-roll inducing closer to 40. Unless you love to decorate out of the neighbors' recycling bins.The rooms do have cushioned window seats which are perfect for watching the fog roll in - we could see Alcatraz from our room. And the location is great, close to restaurants, shops, and the piers. As long as you're planning to spend a lot of time out seeing the city, this will serve as a reasonable home base due to the fantastic location.Dear KC,Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay with us!Yes, we are definitely not the Radisson anymore. Our property underwent a 32 million dollars renovation where the hotel got transformed from top to bottom in order to create our brand new property, Hotel Zephyr. In this transformation we didn't leave anything undone, thus our rooms were completely remodeled and upgraded all the way, including a higher quality of brand new mattresses. Our public spaces were also completely redesigned, our interior lobby got expanded over 5,000 sq feet opening directly to our brand new outdoor lounge area, the yard! all and all creating 11,600 sq of indoor/outdoor interactive space where we encourage our guests to let loose and have fun. That thought of going back to your childhood, embracing a sense of adventure and discovery was an essential part of the designer's inspiration while creating the fresh and fun environment in our hotel and specially in the yard. She used unexpected materials, from recycled corrugated metals and cargo containers to upcycled nautical materials and shipping crates, scrap transformed into treasure at every corner to evoke that childlike sense of excitement that comes with a great adventure regardless of your age! KC, I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our prime location and phenomenal views very much and that our front office manager was able to upgrade your accommodations as he continued to service you all the way during your stay to make it as enjoyable as possible for you in true Zephyr service spirit!Warm regards, Carmen CruzGeneral Manager",Neutral
"Visted San Diego and Hotel Solamar on the First Leg of our Honeymoon and were looking forward to visiting as we base our Hotel choices solely on reviews of Trip Advisor.Arrived on Labor Day (national holiday apparently) the day after our wedding and after two flight totally 13hrs and needless to say shattered at around 5pm only to find our room wasn't ready and we would have to wait 10-15mins for it to be ready, that then turned into 30mins and got told we could relax by the pool and they would let us know when it was ready, headed to the pool which was pumping music like a beach party, no problem as we were just happy to find a seat, 45mins later we headed back down and then got told that he by the same receptionist that it would be would only another 15mins as he had been dealing with something else, finally at just after 6 we got our room throughout the saga, we were almost made to feel like we were to blame. The Hotel and the room itself were fantastic and the quality and cleanness of the room were top quality and couldn't be faulted, we had a bottle of champagne and a happy birthday card Which magically later in the day to a Comgratulations card! Which was a nice touch.One of the first things we did find however was that the safe didn't work, which with our passports and cash etc we sure needed. Reported on the phone and were told we could go out and Maintence would repair, that evening when got back it still wasn't fixed, so called again in the morning to ask again and when still not repaired that evening asked reception for 3rd time. Still wasn't repaired so gave up asking!!wine hour was a nice touch, was served most evenings by a lady from the phillipenes who was lovely whenever we saw her, unfortunately on the Tuesday after a long day at the Zoo, there was a older blonde lady serving who was simply Rude and was possible the rudest person we came across, at first we thought she disliked us for bring a younger crowd, however when speaking to other guests in the lift we weren't the only people to notice this.The pool area itself was lovely and offered lovely views over the Gaslamp, unfortunately service wasn't much better when we did visit with the barman being more interested in the baseball game on, than any customers.finally when we did get home to the uk, we checked our credit card statement to find we'd been double billed for our stay, so after long call trying to get someone to help from within the hotel a voicemail was left and the problem that should never happen was resolved quickly.Overall we lovely San Diego, the Hotel we loved and the rooms were lovely, the Valet staff were friendly and the cleaning staff very nice but unfortunately too much poor customer service soured our visit. Especially constant failings over the safe problem and the rude blonde wine lady.We don't ask much where we stay, just a clean room and friendly, smiling and helpful staff, Hotel - Great, Staff.....Customer Service courses needed for many,I suppose what you pay is what you get.",Neutral

"I am not quite sure why this is a Best Western Plus. A Best Western Oke is a better description. But it was better than the one we had in LA.

"Normally JW Marriott properties are very well-appointed, service is great, rooms are spacious and clean, and all the elements of the property are well-designed. However, I found this hotel to be very poorly run, poorly maintained, and awkwardly designed. My department held a weeklong meeting there in mid-January, 2013. The staff was absolutely top-notch in terms of friendliness and accommodation. Shortly after checking in, I used the lobby bathroom and it wasn't clean. At all. The room was nice, clean, and large. The bed was comfortable. Above the bed, though is a smoke alarm with a bright green LED. Bright and annoying. Multiple people taped things over the light from the second night on.On several of the days i finished with meetings around 430-500 pm only to find that housekeeping had not been to my room. One day, they didn't come at all. The restroom by the conference areas is just a mess. Fixtures pulling out of the wall, screws missing, stalls unclean.I will say that the food was good (though i never tried the actual restaurant) and they had a lot of healthy options. There are several shuttles that will drive you within a certain radius for free. Getting one is a little bit of a CF as there didn't appear to be much of a system.This isn't a bad hotel. It is, however, a terrible JW Marriott.",Neutral
"We were here for a couple of days before leaving for our cruise. We were in a queen room in the main building and facing out onto the street. The hotel was very quaint and the hotel staff were very efficient and super friendly. The room itself was a little tired but the bed was comfortable. The weather while we were in NOLA was pretty awful and the room was cold and drafty. The area has lots to see but can be a little sketchy at night. All in all it was a good deal and we would probably stay again. Hi Melody, thank you for choosing the historic French Market Inn. We appreciate your kind words about our staff and accomodations.

"Our room was extremely cramped and the hotel is in need of TLC. I can tell that the hotel is making serious strides towards improvement and the staff is seriously the highlight of the entire stay. They are wonderful and made us feel welcome during our entire stay. Besides the cleanliness factor in both the room and common areas, my biggest complaint is the bathroom has no countertop space. I love my toiletries and styling products and there was no place to put either. I ended up almost catching the room on fire because there is no counter space or even an edge of the sink in which to put my curling iron. I dropped my curling iron several times on the floor and it fell into the toilet at one point (hence the sparks and almost fire).Hi Ms. Adena B, I am sorry to hear that the room you stayed at was a little small for you.

"Ok people, before the bashing begins just remember you are paying roughly 129/night and you get free WiFi and a hot breakfast to boot. All in an area where it usually runs 200+/night. You get what you want to pay for it. You will not get Hilton like amenities at this kind of deal.First the good:1) Great location, right off the freeway, 2 min from a huge shopping mall and plaza with everything under the sun to eat at. 10 min from Seaworld or Gaslamp or Qualcomm.2) Good breakfast, decent choices, some healthy items, coffee is good.3) Fridge and microwave in the rooms. AC works nicely. The bed was good, with a lot of pillows, which I believe they just switched out to new ones.4) Friendly staff at front desk. Now the not so good, or you get what you pay for:1) The pool is loud when active until 10pm. The rooms face the pool in an L shape, it echoes through the halls. If no one is there, then it is fine. During summer, it's brutal.2) The rooms do need updating. You can see it is a work in progress, but the walls in my rooms were all marked up, the decor was outdated. Hallways and elevator showed heavy signs of use. Pocket door for bathroom was very heavy and loud. One telephone didn't work, etc. Our blackout drapes were torn and pulling away from the window, so it did not stop much light during the day for my son's naps.3) Thin walls. We heard every footstep above us, every creak. We also heard everything in the halls, and with the outdoor floors you can hear everything rolling on it, or people walking through. Once asleep, not a bother.4) 8 parking fee. Whatever, it is stated on the website. Just add it to the room rate and call it free, makes the customer feel better and not nickel and dimed.5) Ant attack in our room, but they did remedy quickly when we notified. 6) The sofa bed was a joke. 7) Elevator would take us to level 3 when we pressed level 2. All day, until I told them about it.Look, this place is ok. You get good value for the rate you pay, which is cheap. It is obvious the manager is doing a lot of damage control here on TripAdvisor by trying to respond to all complaints, which reflects why the ranking for this hotel is so low, as there are a lot of complaints.Would I stay here again with family Probably not. But for a cheap room, and if I was by myself maybe. But not for my family, there were too many annoyances, but we walked out of there for under 300 total for two nights. Good luck people. But don't nail the resort for not being like Hilton when you are only paying 129/night ok!It was my pleasure to read your objective review that pointed out the things you liked about our hotel, as well as some of the things you had a concern with. We read and act upon all our reviews in order to improve the service and comfort of all of our guests. It is clear you understand we are a very conveniently located hotel that offers reasonable rates, unique room layouts and features, a free breakfast buffet and most of all, dedicated professional staff. I agree there are some aspects of our hotel that are a bit overdue for attention, however we do have an on-going and aggressive improvement and upgrade schedule. This year the focus has been on new linen, early next year will be the furniture upgrades and dcor, among other items. As much as we would like to, we cant get everything new all at once, however we do have excellent engineers who keep things running smoothly, or if a guest discovers something we missed. Some things like a busy swimming pool in summer vacation season or parking fees for most all hotels in this area are things we cannot change. Even so as you pointed out, we think we offer the best in rates, location and value to our guests. We sincerely appreciate your business and taking the time to provide your comments to us and hope you will stay with us again to see all the great things we are doing at Comfort Suites, Mission Valley! Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming, General Manager",Neutral

I stayed here for 2 days and it was a nice place to stay. The room offered a mini fridge and coffee pot. The room was small but it was only me and I was there just for sleeping. The room was neat and clean when I arrived and while I stayed. I had a ways to walk to get to my room and it was dark so the map that they gave me didn't help much. The air conditioner was a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper it will bother you if you run it at night. The window does open but it is on the walkway side of the room. There are two hot tubs on the property and a pool. I ate at the cafe on the property and it was very good. They DO NOT offer airport transportation but I got and Uber for about 4.,Neutral

"I got a Travelzoo Offer and was eager to check out this boutique and non-gaming (no casino) hotel on the south end of the Boardwalk in between what was The Hilton (now Atlantic Club Casino) and what is still somehow The Tropicana.The Chelsea is a renovated smallish seaside hotel/motel that has been glammed up and given a hipster vibe featuring a couple of retro restaurants, a nightclub (C5) and two petite pools, the larger of the two offering cabanas five floors above street level.What you must know is that there are two towers. One, the Luxe is closer to the beach and features a bit more polish than the...Annex. The Annex is the luxe tower's ugly step sister and be clear where you are staying when making a reservation at The Chelsea as the Annex is still haunted by the ghosts of its fleabag motel past. Oh wait, those are not ghosts, those are for real and true prostitutes outside your window on Atlantic Avenue pacing back and forth and wishing they could somehow magically get out of the late 1980s, off of crack, and away from their pimps. As the Annex is only four floors high you cannot look down your nose at them from your still needing to be cleaned balcony.By the way, my balcony came security free, complete with no lock and no door handle (see pics). The room itself was clean in two dimensions only with no clock, stains on the carpets and pillows, paintings and mirrors missing, spills on the walls, and rust stains on the trash cans.A bit more grime than glam.But on the upside...The staff is lovely. Friendly and folksy. Even the black suited bouncers at the night club were attitude free. The drinks were strong enough although the DJ had the skill level of a pizzaria jukebox. Note that club admission is free to hotel guests before midnight although the joint tends to close early...2:30ish. Special mention goes out to the concierge (Michael, I think), my always eager and smiling housekeeper and Maxine behind the front desk.The crowd is out of The Real Word/Jersey Shore complete with the requisite twenty-something white girls whose shoes come off after only two hours. If you want to be treated like a big-girl walk like one...in your heels, all the way to your room honey.Decor in the public areas is just fine, and although I did not eat in any of the restaurants people seemed pleased enough.I love the concept but give the execution only a C. In the hospitality business it's always about the details and this is where The Chelsea comes up short. It's a shame that management and ownership cannot match their employee's enthusiasm and efforts to make this property something special and unique.It's also a shame that a walk down Atlantic Ave, towards the Tropicana feels dangerous. Being surrounded by real sad sack old school motels is not something that the Tourist Bureau can fix or the police can scare away.It's easy to get bored with the fake friendliness and always getting 10 less than you pay for mentality of the chain hotels of AC (Showboat, Bally's, Caesars, Harrah's, Taj...I'm looking at you.) so if you're looking for some edge and a dirt under the fingernails vibe, The Chelsea is for you.It should be a value stay so please never overpay.",Neutral
"Very fun looking property. Pool table in the lobby and board games in the bar. The room was large and sunny--modern furnishings and fixtures. The bed was comfortable. But....it felt a bit rundown. The carpet was threadbare and not that clean. The cleaner they use for the shower to prevent mold was so smelly I had to close the door to the shower room so I could sleep. I pity the housekeeping staffforhaving to breathe that every day. There was no tv remote in the room. And the valet parking system was problematic. You can call down to the desk 5 to minutes before you need your car. Both times I. Did that and the desk didn't let the valets know. I had to still wait, and they have to drive all the way around two blocks to get you your car. Not the best system. Needs better management and thought into all there procedures. We truly appreciate the honest observations and can certainly bring those to the team for improvement. Thanks for staying with us and hope that you give us another opportunity the next time you're in town.",Neutral
"Pros:+ This hotel literally situated in front of Disneyland. You could go back to hotel for nap if you are too tired.+ This hotel is clean.+ Denny's Restaurant is just in front of the Hotel, if you are hungry, you can get it fixed in any hour.Cons:- No tea making facility. If you need hot water, you have to use the coffee machine to boil water.- The room we stay has water drainage problem. It seems like water is taking forever to drain in the wash basin and the bathtub. If you have a young family, this may the hotel for you as it is just a stone's throw away from disneyland.",Neutral
"After reading a number of reviews about this place we decided to give it a try. The hotel itself is a motel. The staff that we experienced were all good and helpful. The Inn does sit at a busy intersection but with the A/C unit on in the room we heard very little through the night. We did face Lomard Street. The room was big with a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. These would come in handy as I would not consider the continental breakfast provided to be substantial by any means. However, it was something in the morning before leaving and finding some real food. The bathroom was big and clean though it could have used a couple of more towels. There was no problem having hot water for our showers in the morning. The linens were clean. The bed could have been more comfortable for our liking but we are all different and expect different things from our beds.Not being familiar with the lay of the land we took the info provided of others indicating it was only a 15 minute walk to the pier 39 and also used this in our decision to stay here. The location for being central is great. YOu are no more than 20 minutes to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. If you walk the other way you are about the same to Crissy Field and the Presidio. The World's Crookedest Street is about 4 uphill blocks away. Getting to here from the airport was uneventful and quite easy. The neighbourhood it is in is safe by our standards and we did not feel uncomfortable walking back from the pier alter in the evening. There are some wonderful restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood as well no more than a 10 minute walk in the direction of the Presidio on Chestnut.The free parking and internet were also added benefits considering the cost of parking in some areas and other hotels in San Francisco.With all this said it is not the greatest nor is it the worst. For the money we paid in San Francisco it did provide value for our dollar. As others have stated if you want upscale you will pay for it but this is not that place.",Neutral
"OPI's actually encouraging people via email to write TripAdvisor evaluations even though they're undergoing renovation of their bathrooms. I'm a little surprised since I can't really rate this stay as high as I have in the past, due to ongoing construction. Anyway, I stayed here 4 nights at their 99 construction rate. Can't beat the rate, though you will have to tolerate workmen pounding away on things all day long, including Saturday and Sunday. However, they didn't start too early in the morning. And there's a fair amount of dust and sharing of the (slow) elevator with construction dudes rolling away carts of material to dump. I had a side room for the first time - not as nice as the ones that look out over the pool to the beach, but it put me farther away from the construction noise so I didn't really mind on this trip. As always, P.B. can be a wild place on the weekends -- good or bad, depending on what you're looking for -- but be prepared.Thank you again for another review! We're happy you've become such a loyal guest of ours - and although this year you had to deal with some extra noise and dust, the goal of our renovation and updates is to give you even more value for your next stay with us. As always, we look forward to seeing you again!",Neutral

We really enjoyed the ability to have a few meals in our room on our latest trip to the Disney area. We spent 5 days at the hotel. A few days at the parks and downtown Disney. They have a bus to bring you to Disney. The hotel is comfortable. Housekeeping did a great job working around our varied schedule. We got an early check in with no problems. The pool area was enjoyed by the 5 year old. One note. They advertise a dinner as part of your stay from Monday through Thursday. It is not much to speak of so be prepared. The breakfast was good.,Neutral
"I feel very torn about the French Market Inn. On the plus side, the hotel occupies a perfect location in the French Quarter near the river. The cluster of old buildings it occupies surround an irregular courtyard that is lovely and full of charm. The complex makes you feel part of the citys history, and the rooms are very competitively priced. And the staff are very friendly and helpful. But our deluxe double room was very cramped and dark. Hardly any lights in the room and it wasnt possible to keep the curtains open very much as the big window faced directly into a public staircase. As a result, I literally had to use the flashlight function on my phone to see inside the small closet. The walls between rooms were thin, so we could hear the buzz of a low conversation next door and also woke up one morning to the cleaning staff parked and chatting In the corridor outside our door. Finally, we ran into delays with the valet parking, both dropping the car off (the space in front of the hotel was completely full up with other cars, leaving us no place to put the car) and picking it up at the end of our stay (we waited an extra half hour despite giving them a one-hour warning before we wanted the car). Thank you for choosing our hotel. We do our best to place guests in rooms that exceed their expectations and typically receive high marks for our accommodations. We are sorry to learn of the difficulties you experienced and the delays with our valet service.

"Staff was very friendly. They could have explained the restaurant/game night happenings so one could participate. Great concept for a hotel. The problem is they want to be a hip cool bar/restaurant/hotel, but it is so loud!!! You can't have lots of fun in the courtyard and not bug hotel guests. OR do a better job of encouraging hotel guests to participate in activities. I really enjoyed my first night here so much--bed was very comforatable, loved the mod renovations amd the beta fish. I booked again for another night the latter part of my trip. I didnt' want same room again (17) because a/c squeaked badly and the curtain covered the unit. However, 17 was a cooler room than the room I stayed in, but prefered the a/c unit in the second room. Liked that there was lots of white noise to help drown out the street/bar noise. Stayed on a Thurs and there was a crazy bingo game--it is LOUD. You can hear the banging around of the other guests. Knowing now about bingo night, I wouldn't stay here again on a Thurs. It is a really good concept and people were having lots of fun, but noise carries here.Thank you for your review and feedback. Point well taken on our 1 night a month Bingo game. Very sorry for the noise challenge. We will be doing 2 things as we move forward. 1 is do a better job notifying our guests of our events and 2 to minimize the noise via stopping the bingo game earlier.

"Sometimes location wins out in picking a place to overnight, and this BW at the edge of the French Quarter has it. The most popular things to see were a 15-minute walk or a combination of streetcar rides. The staff was helpful, knowledgable, and friendly. No mis-steps there. Breakfast had eggs, meats, breads, potatoes, waffles and more. What are the negatives The rooms are dated and dark. The soft water combined with soap makes the shower floor a little slippery.

"I stayed at this hotel for a business trip due to the proximity of the hotel to my customer.The Good:Great location. Close to Times Square (walking distance), the price (my company was happy with the choice) and the service people (always ready to assist in dinner reservations).The not so Good:The lifts ( average wait for a lift to the lobby was ten minutes), the bathroom ( let's just say I had a pretty significant problem that went unresolved for two days and it wasn't the sink or shower) and the noise on 39th street ( 2:00am I heard bottles smashing on the sidewalk and trash being picked up soon thereafter). I expect noise while in Manhattan but other hotels I frequent are much more insulated from the outside.For business, an okay choice, however, when wife and I head down for a long weekend of shows on my dime, it's The Marquis in Times Square for sure.Valued guest,Thanks so much for your honest and candid feedback about your stay with us!

"Visiting Seattle with my partner for an overnight stop on our trip down the west coast en route to California. The hotel check in staff were immediately unhelpful. I don't like the complexity of the car park and how badly sign posted it is. They should make provision for some limited parking whilst you check in but instead they leave you parked in front of the gate in limbo whilst someone in the party runs in to sort it. The room itself - a king on the 4th floor with views of the Space Needle - was large and comfortable with a good bed. The bathroom was, perhaps, a little basic - the toilet looked very down market and the shower had very poor pressure. Some nicer quality toiletries would also be a nice touch at 400/night. That said, we both slept well - though both found the air con to be unnecessarily noisy. The microwave display is also so bright that I got up to unplug it so we could sleep. We aren't the types to need pitch black and silence to sleep but it's almost obnoxiously bright and a discernible blue hue is visible even with closed eyes. Not good enough. The automatic blinds are a nice touch, however. Breakfast was awful but checkout smooth. All in all..

"My husband and I have stayed at this Hampton Inn several times over the years on our way to and from Florida. We are finding that this Hampton has small rooms which are fairly dark. The bathroom configuration has always been a frustration for me - there is a lot of empty space that could be used. In the last room we stayed in, the toilet was so close to the shower door that it was like sitting in an airplane seat (no arm room). The knob for the flusher had just enough room to go down without hitting the shower stall. Very bad installation. The breakfast is the normal Hampton fare. I tried the croissants and they were old and heavy. The staff are always friendly and the hotel is located close to a large mall. I was going to book a room again for October, 2017 but saw that the price had doubled. As a result, we will be staying elsewhere.",Neutral

"I joined a friend to attend a wonderful dollhouse miniature show this past weekend here in the Chicago Marriott O'Hare. Being very much a budget traveller when I travel alone, I figured sharing the cost of the room wouldn't be too much more than my budget hotels in Europe. Our room had a special rate because of the show but the 142 became became 191.52 with 2 nights parking and the normal taxes on both room and parking. My friends share would be slightly less - 164.80 because of the no parking fee.So, first of all, I thought paying for parking was sort of unfriendly. It wasn't like it was an enclosed lot or anything - just parking out in front of the hotel like most any other hotels I've stayed in in the states. And aside from its humungous and very nicely decorated lobby with seating galore for visiting, I didn't find anything really special abut the hotel. We had two beds with very noisy sheets (sort of like sleeping under paper coverings), no fridge(!), had to pay for Wi-fi for each day. Fortunately I had a personal hotspot that we used and when I called this morning to make sure that guests really had to pay for wi-fi in their rooms (another guest had told us no, they put it on your bill but take it off when you check out) and I mentioned being glad I had a personal hotspot and she said oh, you have to pay for that too. I said I wasn't billed for it and she looked up our bills and said that neither was my friend. I asked if I should advise TA readers that they can use their personal hotspots and she said no, because they'll be billed. So take your pick on that one. I, for one, couldn't believe there was no wi-fi and fridge in the rooms. Most of the hotels I stay in in the states are lower down the ladder - Best Western, Days Inn, etc., and I always have Wi-fi and very often have a fridge. And then there were just little things, we had a one-cup-at a time coffee maker in the room for which they provided 4 packets of coffee and 2 tea bags, one black tea, the other chamomile. And...the little cup that would hold the coffee grounds was missing. We both drank tea so just poured the water in to heat and let it drip out into our cups but I had to get extra tea bags because we both drink black. Our first night there, I couldn't get the bedside phone to work - have no idea why because the desk phone worked and they both worked after that first night.So, I guess I'm saying our stay was basically okay but if you want to keep anything cold, forget that and if you don't have a personal hotspot (or don't want to take a chance on getting billed for using it), you'll have to go down to the lobby for wi-fi where it's free but sometimes just has two bars although I noticed in the evenings it seems to be higher. Thank you for your feedback, and we're sorry to hear you weren't completely satisfied with your stay. The phone issue you experienced will certainly be addressed. As to the parking fee, all hotels in the area charge for parking, due to our proximity to O'Hare. We also offer complimentary internet to all Rewards members who book directly through Marriott, and we have complimentary fridges available upon request. We apologize if the internet policy was not properly communicated, and please don't hesitate to contact us directly if you'd like to discuss your experience. We're glad to hear you enjoyed the miniatures show, and we hope to see you again next time.",Neutral
"I booked this hotel because it had decent reviews and the price was cheap. The things I liked was mainly the location. It was very close to nearby attractions such as Sea World and Mission Beach. There were also markets and stores nearby if you need any essentials. I also enjoyed nearby places to eat that were local eats at reasonable prices. Another plus was that I was able to get 2 queen beds at the same price as 1 King. Also, no charge for parking.I didn't like how the towels were stained and dirty. The room was musty and the AC unit was under the window so whenever the fan was blowing, the curtains would fly up. The breakfast was minimal with different breads and pastries and bananas.Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your recent visit to San Diego.

I went to this hotel due to a business meeting and had some issues checking in. I was given the wrong room then had a couple of other issues but was quickly addressed.

Room did seem like it had been updated some but shower still seemed outdated. Thank you for taking time to review Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center.

"I booked this hotel way in advance for the Billy Joel concert because I wanted to be able to walk back to hotel instead of getting on train. At first I did not look at my reservation, my fault, and went to the Hotel Lincoln instead.I was very excited when I got here. great customer service, friendly and helpful.The desk clerk said I was not in the system so i checked my paper and he said I was at wrong hotel. The baggage guy was so nice and loaded my stuff back into my car and waited for my husband to go get car. We arrived at The Inn at Lincoln Park and it did offer parking for 30 per night and we were so tired of riding in the car we said sure. They have window air conditioners and no electric door and no elevator. I was less than thrilled but we were not going to let it ruin our night. Get to the room and it is extremely small and you have to keep you curtains open if you want air to get into the room. Everything was pretty old and out lamp shade had a big stain on it. The pillows were like postage stamps and it was def no frills. We were woken at 6 am by a loud drilling from below. Not sure what it was but I guess that is the city.

The scenery around you isnt good. I felt the walk outside the hotel seemed a bit sketchy - especially after dark. Exiting the hotel right on Broadway takes you to the waterfront attraction. Lots of homeless, druggies and weirdos down along the waterfront that can be off putting. Its not too far from the hotel but not that close to the hotel, either. Exit the hotel to the left and you can walk to the gas lamp area. Its definitely a hike. Id suggest not walking to the gas lamp all the way on Broadway as the neighborhood down that way gets kind of gritty with a lot of homeless and panhandlers. If you walk to the gas lamp area from the hotel head down Broadway and go down 4th and then cut over to the gas lamp area. This 4th Street seemed to be a safer to me. Overall, this hotel was good. Some things fell a little short such as the pool area. It was a super small skinny lap pool. The deck area near it was a nice place to get some late day sun but they dont do the deck area any justice. Its uneventful. No bar area and nothing to speak of happening there. Just some couches and lounge chairs. The hotel should play this area up more. The hotel bar area was okay but most people are in and out at this place. No real reason to hang around. A lot of the local restaurants have good and affordable happy hour food and drink specials so be sure to get out, walk and explore. If youre a baseball fan do stop and see a Padres game. The stadium is a great experience. Finally, this is a good place to stay when traveling for business.Thank you for staying at the Westin San Diego.

"Stayed here for 6 days. Location is very good, right in the marina and cow hollow area which has many good restaurants and bars. MUNI stops right around the corner. The hotel and room are pretty run down. Old and and show signs of wear and tear. Tv made a weird noise. No AC, just heater(which also makes noise). Beds are ok. Bathroom is nice. The cleaning staff does daily cleaning of the room. For the kind of price paid, I didn't have high expectations, plus it was just a place to crash at night so overall it worked out. Area can sometimes be noisy due to the fire station being around the corner and bar/restaurant patrons walking the surrounding streets. If you are a light sleeper maybe some earbuds would be good. Overall: it's a budget hotel that shows its age and wear and tear. The location is very good and feels safe. If you are looking for a place to just sleep in, are not too picky about a room and don't have much money to spend in a nicer hotel then this would work for you.",Neutral
This hotel was a very good rate. We stayed here mid-september on a stop over trip to San Fran. The hotelroom had plenty of space for our family of 3 BUT it did smell really really musty. The shower curtain was a bit worn. The water pressure was great! The breakfast provided was very good but the seating area was so incredibly small. The woman at the front desk was a wonderful help with out Disneyland visit. She gave us some tips and helped us order our tickets.Thank you for taking the time to share your review. I apologize for any musty smell that you experienced during your stay. We will schedule extra daily carpet cleaning.

"My husband and I just stayed at this hotel for our anniversary weekend and found that the hotel accommodations were clean and comfortable. The area surrounding the hotel was nice and offered a lot of options for dining. I would have offered a 5-star rating, but there were some noise issues that caused me to rate the hotel a little lower.The check-in process was smooth and incredibly easy. The Marriott app now offers the option for mobile check-in. When checking in on the app, the hotel allows you to let them know what time you plan on arriving in the event that early check-in is an option. The check-in time was 4:00 but we asked to arrive at 2:00. By 9:00 that morning, we had received a text letting us know that our room was ready and waiting for us when we arrived. The hotel lobby was really nice and the lobby staff was very friendly and accommodating when we arrived. Because we checked in using the app, we only had to walk up to the counter, show our ID, and our room key was waiting for us. It was very convenient and made for an expedient check in process. We liked that there was a complimentary self-park option because many of the hotels in Atlanta charge a ridiculous amount to park. That was actually the deciding factor for us on this hotel. The price was reasonable and allowed for free parking. The room was very clean and comfortable. One of our favorite aspects about this hotel was that there was a sky bridge that allowed for a short walk over the highway and to the mall. The mall parking lot offered a lot of dining options. We were able to walk to dinner and have a few drinks without having to worry about driving back. The hotel also offered a shuttle service that would drive us anywhere within a 3 mile radius. We didn't use the option, but liked knowing that it was there. We enjoyed drinks in the bar the night we arrived. The bar staff wasn't at all rude, but also not overly friendly, but the atmosphere was nice and cozy. We ate breakfast at the hotel in the mornings. It was pricey for the buffet, 19, which included juice/coffee/sodas, but it was delicious. We ate there twice for breakfast and the staff was very friendly both visits.The only major downside to the hotel was one that I noticed had been mentioned in some other reviews. The hotel was noisy, and the noise carried. Our room was 1250, which was right across from the elevators. People would exit the elevators all night long, and the noise carried right into the room, and kept both my husband and I up all night long. This really affected our trip in that we found ourselves going back to the room the second afternoon to take a nap before dinner. I assume that staying further away from the elevators and possibly being located in a corner room would fix the issue, but I cannot say for sure. This was the main reason for my lower rating. It's hard to consider the weekend a successful mini-vacation away from the kids when we came home more tired than when we left. I would recommend this hotel to others, and would probably give it another shot, as long as I was able to request a room that was in a corner and as far away from the elevators as possible.Thank you for a detailed review of your stay with us, I appreciate the feedback. Hope to see you back with us soon!",Neutral

"This is a brand new hotel in what seems to be a newly developing area near sea world. That being said, there's a lot of construction on additional hotels right next door. Every day during our week stay, there were people working, tractors moving and beeping at the crack of dawn and late into the afternoon. Also, I shared a room with the a coworker, although I appreciate the nice design of a hanging barn door for the bathroom, I think adding a lock would've been a good call. No lock on the bathroom door is a little awkward. The track was also not level on the door so it would slowly open when you tried to close it all the way. We had to resort to wedging a towel between the door and the threshold to keep it from rolling open. That aside, the hotel has everything you need, free breakfast in the morning, business center, and a cvs close by. If you're a budget traveler or just need a basic room for business, this is a good one.",Neutral

The towels are new, but the bath towels are small and I'm not a big person. The bed was comfortable and the room was warm even though the outside temp was 5 degrees.

"If you are taking an early morning flight from Philadelphia International Airport and you don't want to get up very early to drive to the airport, it's not a bad idea to stay overnight at the Hampton Inn adjacent to the airport and use their park and fly service. On a recent trip to North Carolina, my wife and I were scheduled on an early flight, and we live about two hours away by car. Rather than awaken in the wee hours to make our flight, we drove to the Hampton the previous afternoon, parked our car in their designated parking lot, enjoyed a good sleep and a good breakfast, and were driven to the airport by van on the following morning. All things considered, the cost was reasonable and we didn't miss any sleep.Like all Hamptons, the facility was clean and comfortable, the staff was pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast was more than ample. This hotel seems to be showing its age a bit, but that didn't negatively impact our stay in any way. The location is very good as an airport hotel...the van will get you to the departures area in about ten minutes, but there are only two convenient restaurants nearby, a Ruby Tuesday and the restaurant in the nearby Embassy Suites, and there are no nearby shops (excluding the airport, of course).",Neutral

"Having flown in from Australia en route to Quebec I had a stop over in Philadelphia. Looking forward to a nice quiet room and a break from the 20+ hours of travel it took to get to Philadelphia I checked in at the Fairfield. The free shuttle arrived as promised and the driver was friendly. Reception was pleasant but distant , the room was clean. I had forgotten to pack a power adapter and upon checking with reception and eventually translating the word adapter into a version of the word the receptionist could understand I was told they didn't have them only power point to USB adapters . Which was great for my phone. It was annoying to not be able to get an adapter from reception but even more annoying was the nonchalant attitude of the staff. Not in any way rude just uncaring . The free breakfast was welcome and filling . All in all the place was nothing more and nothing less than a 3 star hotel .

"Although this hotel could use a new coat of paint (which it appears they plan on doing in the new year), our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive.

"My friend found this hotel and we were looking for a good price and good location in NYC for 4 nights in October.

1. Front desk crew courteous but very young.2. Continental breakfast is OK. At times you had difficulty getting a table mid morning. 3. Exterior of hotel needs painting and maintenance. 4. Air conditioner in room is weak. 5. This is not a Marriott or Starwoods hotel. 6. Location to beach is very nice. 7. Parking in garage is very tight. I damaged my right side driver mirror trying to park our Yukon XL last night. The parking garage is setup for compact cars. Not everyone drives a compact car. 8. Hotel maintenance staff is very courteouse and responsive. It is my guess that hotel ownership is tight with capital dollars for improvements if they can fill the hotel without too much trouble at the rates they charge. 9. The empty building across from the hotel should be torn down. It detracts from the area. 10. The fire department is one (1) building over. This is good if you have a fire and from a security perspective but bad if they are out on calls and sound the sirens. 11. Only saw a few street people. The SD PD made two (2) arrests of street people when we were there. They were very proactive in this area. 12. The location of the SD Life Guard station is very positive. The beach are by the hotel is monitored heavily. The life guard staff on the beach were very proactive on currents in the ocean. 13. The beach needs to cleaned daily from the seaweed. 14. We walked 3 miles up and down the beach and most of the folks seemed to be tourists that were on the beach. 15. You have many restaurant options within walking distance. 16.

"This hotel has quite a few things going for it. First off, it is in an amazing location for tourists. Right by Fisherman's wharf and close to all the sights there are to see. The hotels seems to have gone through a renovation recently and the lobby is actually a pretty cool place to hang out. Add to that the game room with ping pong, pool, shuffle board, and a couple other games plus the nice outdoor area. In the courtyard, there are fire pits, ample seating, more games, and a food truck. If you are traveling with teens, this is ideal. There is a bar attached to the court yard where you can get drinks and food. It isn't part of the hotel, but guests get a 10 discount with a room key. The staff at the hotel was nice and responsive if we ever needed anything.As far as the rooms, they are average. They are updated, but are still a little dark and dreary. Our room had a magnetic dart board, but only 3 darts. The sink in the bathroom was cool looking, but not very functional with very little counter space. We had a room above the courtyard and were able to see the ocean which was nice. The noise from the court yard wasn't a problem. The major issue I had and the reason for only 3 stars was the price. I know San Francisco is expensive, but I expected more for 450 a night. We have stayed in this area of San Fran numerous times and have paid the same price for a hotel, but it was much nicer. This hotel feels more like a 200-250 a night hotel. So, if you're looking at a time of year when the price is 250 or less, you'll be very happy at the Hotel Zephyr.Hello Annette, Thank you so much for staying with us.

"My husband and I thought we'd stay here for our anniversary. Not a good choice at All!!! They not only did not have a room for us to stay in (as previously reserved), but they ended up putting us in a triangle shaped room that was as tiny as a corner closet...with a view of the building next door in close proximity. When asked to move we were told that they didn't have anywhere else in the ENTIRE hotel to put us. UNREAL! Not to mention that the staff seemed very uninterested in the fact that they were unable to accommodate us. I did however enjoy the location of the hotel, as it is adjoined to Lenox Mall and has great some great restaurants in the immediate area. This hotel was not at all worth the money!Thank you for planning your Anniversary celebration at the JW Marriott Atlanta. I am so very sorry to learn of your disappointment in receiving your requested room type. While we strive to ensure we honor as many of the specific room requests as we can (especially for a special occasion) we can't always determine if that room type will be available on the day of check in if that room type is still occupied from the night prior.

"Booked a room at this hotel for one night. The reseption was just a table in the hall. Got one room first, arrived to the room and there was a lot of luggage in the room. Someone else was staying in that room. Lucky for us they was out.. Went Down again and got an another room. Thisone was ok. Good beds and clean room. But after we had checked in we was told that we could not use the water for showering etc.. we could only use bottle water. This due to pollution of water the day before. Well if 4 People should shower With bottle water I wouldnt imagine the time that would take:) And there was no discounts for the room...Dear Tonny S,Thank you for taking the time to give us your valuable feedback regarding your recent stay at the St. James Hotel. We appreciate you being understanding about the city wide water ordinance that was issued. You were able to use the water for showering but were asked to use bottled water to brush your teeth.

"Well, I really wanted to like this place. I come to New Orleans 3-4 times a year. Typically I stay around the corner at another hotel. They were booked so I thought I would try this place.Checking in was fine but I noticed most of the other guests were tourists. That's okay if everything flows like it should.Continental breakfast is brought to your room per the order sheet you hang on your door.Monday night I made my selection and indicated it to be brought up between 7 and 7:30. Tuesday morning at promptly 7:30 as I'm walking out the door, the order arrives. I tell the worker I have to leave and to give it to someone else. I have meetings all week at 8:00.Tuesday night, I fill out the card and write on it, if it can't be delivered at 7:00 then don't deliver. Wednesday morning I get a call at 6:45 indicating my breakfast is ready in the courtyard downstairs.Wednesday night I ask the clerk how do I do this for Thursday and she says to just write it on the card for Thursday morning.So I make my selection and write that I will be in the courtyard at 7:00. This morning (Thursday), I go down to the courtyard and nothing. I sit there for 15 minutes with no one in sight. I leave and ask the desk clerk to get my car brought down and ask about breakfast. She knows nothing about it and offers to get some, but I tell her that have to leave.I get back to the room tonight, and there is no selection card...So I go to the desk and ask for one and then mention some of the difficulty with breakfast as I'm 1 out of 3. The male clerk basically stats arguing with me that I should have let them know. Luckily the clerk I spoke with this morning was there and she indicated the I did. The hotel itself is okay. It's old and smells a bit musty, but I don't mind that. The walls are paper thin as I had a virtually in room experience of the amorous exploits of the couple in the next room. I was a bit envious of his stamina....The floor in the room has twice vibrated as though an unbalanced motor is directly below me. Luckily it didn't last long and was only twice.There is dried paint all over the place in the bathroom so maintenance is obviously is sloppy.As indicated there seem to be a lot of foreign travelers here which they seem to cater to.So if you don't have time constraints it's probably an okay hotel, otherwise you might be better off somewhere else.",Neutral

"Room temperature could not be controlled. Adjusting the thermostat was evidently a placebo. Upon check out I was told I would be emailed a copy of my bill. Stayed in the room Tuesday, on Friday still no email. Made reservation through travel agent. While on the road called travel agent mid-afternoon on my scheduled arrival date to cancel and re-book a different city. To the surprise of travel agent hotel imposes a required three day notice of cancellation policy rather than the industry standard same day before 6:00PM. Travel agent called hotel direct and was told I could cancel, but they would still charge my card. Of course this gave them the opportunity to charge me and then possibly still rent the room to another party, while I would be stuck paying them as well as another hotel for a room. I travel about 40 weeks a year thus I have a least 40 opportunities to never again stay in an Aloft hotel, plus I might remember to warn all my fellow travelers.Well it certainly sounds like we didn't get it right for you and for that I sincerely apologize. We do in fact have a 72 hour cancellation policy that would have been clearly stated on the reservation when your travel agent booked so it certainly seems they would have informed you of that especially if you have a volatile schedule.

"Overall, I enjoyed my two night stay at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Downtown Chicago, but have a few concerns. I was in town with a bus load of University of Louisville fans to support our basketball team during the game with DePaul University. There were not enough suites available with two double beds at the hotel to accommodate our group. So, I had to share a king-sized bed with my roommate. We were really disappointed that we couldn't have our own bed. So, we each rotated sleepng in the bed one night and then sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room. However, the sofa bed was absoultely horrible!!! The mattress was very thin and the inner springs poked through the surface of the mattress. This made sleeping very uncomfortable. Also, the top portion of the mattress where your head goes was higher than the rest of the mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a slant. The mattress was so uncomfortable until I closed the sofa bed and replaced the cushions. Then I tried putting the cover on top and sleepng on top of the sofa, However, I am 5'11 tall and the sofa was more like a loveseat size. So, I could not stretch out completely. I got very little sleep and awoke stiff and sore. My back and neck hurt. It was also awkward having to go through the bedroom to use the toilet and shower in the bathroom or to get clothes from the closet without disturbing my roommate while she slept in the bed. The layout of the suite was not well-thoughout as far as utilization of the bathroom and closet.On the plus side of the suite, the kitchen was wonderful! We liked having a fully equipped kitchen with appliances and dishes. We also enjoyed the breakfast! Shirley Fuqua-Jackson, Room 1203Shirley, I am sorry that you did not enjoy your stay at the hotel. I wanted to address your concern about not receiving a room with two double beds. When looking back at the original rooming list that we have from your group leader we do not have you and your roommate in a room with two double beds. The room type that your group leader had assigned to your room was a King Suite with the sleeper sofa. The hotel des have a very limited number of double/double rooms on property so we were unable to change room types if we do not have the availability. I do want to express regret over this misunderstanding. I do apologize for the uncomfortable evening that you spent on our sleeper sofa. We are in the process of replacing all of our bed inserts and we do hope that nobody will be as inconvenienced as you in the future. We do have a limited number of complimentary roll-away beds available if you find the sleeper sofa too uncomfortable in the future. We are pleased that you enjoyed the breakfast and the full stocked kitchen. We do hope to see you again. Sincerely, Vanessa KosloskiSales and Marketing Manager",Neutral
"When checking into a 300+ a night room I expect my bags to be brought to my room. I do not expect to be told to go through the restaurant and meander about until you see elevators. On my meander I did notice a pool which seemed indoor/outdoor and would have possibly been enticing were I not carrying my own luggage and trying to follow the directions given by desk clerk. The room itself was small, but quite clean. There was nothing wrong with it, nor was there anything special. My son enjoyed his room service meal of ribs. Two glasses of Pinot Grigio arrived as Chardonnay with no explanation. Check out was simple, airport shuttle thankfully was beyond efficient, I believe the driver Hector (I believe. It definitely started with a H) was completely aces. Obviously there are better places to stay in Chicago, but I needed something near airport bc of a missed connection. This did the job of clean bed and shower, decent late evening dinner, got us to airport on time. It accomplished these with no charm or warmth which I don't need, but would have relished at the late hour and exhausting day I'd had.Dear Betsy B. Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay with us. We appreciate the positive and not so positive feedback you have for us.

"Stayed at the JW Marriott only one night since I had to travel on a Sunday, I figured I would treat myself on a work trip before heading farther out in the city for the week. I have stayed at the Marriott across the street and honestly the room is just as nice as the JW and parking is half the price. As far as the staff, everyone was friendly and I didn't have any issues. I got a nice King room on the 20th floor. The room smelled perfumey but wasn't overpowering. It was a decent size room and a big bathroom. Room was obviously done in the 90's with the green marble. Overall was a bit dated. There were some hairs on the toilet and in the shower. I find this happens because housekeepers use the same rag to wipe the whole bathroom down so instead of cleaning they just kinda move the germs and hair around. When I went to put my water in the fridge, there was a bottle of half drank juice in there from a previous guest. Also the flat screen tv is probably 8 years old and the screen is so faint you can barely watch it unless all the lights are off. The worst part was there was no hot water in the morning. Since I was about to check out there wasn't much to complain about just a bad start to the morning. The good side is since I am Platinum Elite I have lounge access. The evening dinner was delicious with lobster chowder, chicken and lasagna with assorted fruits and cheeses. Also, cookies and cupcakes for dessert. The breakfast had a good assortment of food as well. Best part of the hotel.Overall, probably wouldn't stay here again for the price unless they went through a remodel of the rooms.Thank you for your post.

"The staff is great - very friendly and helpful. I paid 370 per night for my room (reservations directly with the hotel), so based on the price and other reviews, I expected a pretty nice room. I thought it was pretty dumpy. There was obvious prior water damage on the walls and ceiling, which was poorly repaired. The carpet was old and felt dirty. I made sure to wear flip flops or socks in the room. The bed was extremely hard, so I did not sleep well and woke with a sore back. The whole room, including the bathroom, was painted a dark blue-green. I did enjoy the balcony. Not sure whether to give the hotel a 2 or 3.I did not partake in much of the breakfast which consisted of a waffle station, hard boiled eggs, pastries and cereal. They did have amazing apples, oranges, peaches and plums.The location of the hotel is excellent. I really enjoy P.B.

"Stayed here in July booked with Travelocity. A large part of my disappoint I will blame on Travelocity, I'm pretty sure I was booking a Best Western that was 'right across' from Disneyland and with the inflated price, I was sure of it. When I arrived I of course expressed my concern to the Front Desk and they happily called the other Best Western to see if there was avail, but there was not. They very kind and down to earth front desk clerk checked us in early (9:30AM on a Monday) and we got a 1st floor room very close to the lobby, which I would actually recommend. The room: beds were pretty comfy, bed linens were soft, pillows were plentiful, towels could have been better but did the job. There was a fridge and coffee pot in the room along with a hair dryer. AC unit was a bit loud but when we came back to the room for naps, it didn't bother us one bit. I can't complain much about the room itself --nothing went wrong or was out of place. The location: Here is where I'll get picky. I would not recommend walking to the park with little ones from here. You have to cross a majorly busy intersection, then walk through the Cast Member parking lot (finally found a safe walking area inside). This will bring you to the end of Downtown Disney, from here you can either take the Monorail to Tomorrowland or walk what would be another 'block' to the Main Entrance. I would not do this at night time! Good thing is there is an ART shuttle right in front of the property. I swear by these ART shuttles, 5/day for a shuttle to the front of the parks and runs every 20 mins. Again a positive thing about our room location is that we were able to just open our room door and keep an eye out for the shuttle and then run to it. Long story short, I overpaid on Travelocity, even after considering the location mix up. But the staff is remarkable so it made up for it.",Neutral
"Parking is a serious issue there, we came back and had no parking due to stupid people taking up two parking areas, areas are extremely small as it was, night manager got busy to fix the problem, my suggestion is that each spot be numbered to the room, night manager moved his motorcycle so I could park a brand new car (week old) but my son in law had to crowd into a small area due to stupid stupid people, the next morning I learned that if there is an event across the street people park in your lot, no one should be parking there except paying customers!!!!!!! No customer should be inconvenienced at all either!!!!!! We left Bay Inn Suites up the street since it looked like a Motel 6 thrown up, that was totally misleading internet information. Again, no one should have to deal with parking their car when they are paying customer ever. Let's clean it up especially around the area by some type of vending machine or something, pretty trashy there so that next time I come it looks 100 better.We are very grateful of your feedback. Thank you for staying with us during your recent trip to San Diego.We apologize for the parking issues you experienced and we will take your suggestions into consideration. Unfortunately as we are located in a central location of such a busy city, parking is often hard to find. Many other properties in the area have begun charging a fee for parking as a solution to this dilemma.

We are glad our night manager was able to help out but we will continue searching for a solution to this. We hope you consider staying with us again.",Neutral
"We stayed here whilst my husband was working and I accompanied him for a holiday. The hotel staff are lovely and extremely helpful. The room maid was a joy. The room itself as the title of the hotel suggests is a suite. Comprising lounge/study area with a fridge, coffee maker (coffee provided) and microwave. There is a desk with WiFi (fairly unreliable) and a hard wire connection (more efficient). A comfortable sofa, easy chair and flat screen TV. The bedroom follows off the lounge and we choose to have a king size bed (other options exist). Bed very comfortable, barely adequate hanging space but sufficient drawers. The bathroom was huge, lighting could be better but is ok. Other facilities include an indoor/outdoor pool with nice patio areas to relax. Pool towels freely available. Bar/Restaurant and Coffee bar is ok with a limited menu. The food we had there was fine. The area is generally hotels and a car is a must since there is very little available within walking distance. Very close to the airport and main road network.

"The Nikko is different its a calm smallish hotel 1 blk from UNION Sq ... this is out 4th stay and as usual we liked the location and the rates for rooms included parking and breakfast for 2 .... We did stay the weekend before Christmas so the rates were 350 for a deluxe two queen room. I like the service here, for when we checked in I asked to see if there was an upgrade ( 2 adults 2 small children) upon getting a yes for a bigger room for 60 additional a night I was fine, however upon entering the room it seemed it was the same size as the original booking , I did call and inquire , since I din not like the room upgrade the removed the charge and let me stay in the room .... My question was I really upgraded Either way the pool is great for the kids , the breakfast for free is a asian American buffet so you will be full and the parking ( with in and out ) is 50.00 which came with the room. We like the hotel for its not crowded even though its full. The indoor pool is a nice break from the cold. The bell staff was awesome .... thanks for the help! ....The only draw back for some would be the rooms are a bit older in style .... did not bother us ....Dear DJBSFOThank you for your comments We love that you are a repeat guest. You are smart to purchase the breakfast, pool and parking with the room rate. It is a terrific value.Please visit us soon.Best regardsMarcia Striffeler",Neutral

"Great location but not so good beds. I was traveling with my family to Atlanta downtown. Being a frequent traveler, I often stay at Hilton properties during my trips, so this was the reason I chose this hotel. The location is great if you want to explore the downtown, especially the Olympic Park, World of Coke, CNN Studio, Georgia Aquarium - all of which are at a 10 min walking distance from the hotel. However, the rooms seemed too small and the bed in our room was not that comfortable. Apart from the bed, everything was great!Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

"Suite styled hotel. Used to be another brand every few years. Stayed in same hotel under a different name 5 years ago, but different name. Hotel has not changed.Breakfast was good, and staff has been very nice and pleasant. Free ber and wine for 1 hour from 530pm - 630pm. Nice light evening meal, but nothing spectacular.Hotel corridors in summer time were over 80, and room did not drop in temperature below 76. Called front desk to complain, and was sent to offsite hotel operator who told me she couldn't do anything.Pool looks dirty, but it just is in a bad need of a resurfacing. Pool is locked at 10pm. Shuttle will drop you off for dinner, but shuts down at 7pm, so you have to pay for a cab to return to the hotel. They have free parking, so if you're driving, this is a cheaper than the hotels downtown.For the amount of money that we spent, I would have much rather stayed at a nicer hotel.Thank you for taking time to let us know about your stay here at the Hyatt house. Yes about 4 years ago the hotel went from the Bradford Suites to a Hyatt. I do appoligize about the phone system, it was originally designed to have every room with its own number so when you dial 0 you get an outside operator, because the hotel was designed more as an extended stay property. We are in the process of upgrading the phone system so our guest will no longer have that issue. As far as the AC we have since gotten the hallway units replaced and I can say it feela so much better. Our rooms have a senor controled T Stat, trying to be more energy aware. I hope that the next time you are in Dallas you will come by and see the changes.Thank you again for the welcomed comments,Jeff JonesGeneral Manager",Neutral
"We wanted a place near Mission Bay and often go to Best Westerns. This was far more expensive than the price range indicated on Google Maps, but maybe we looked in the wrong place to get a good price. This is a basic motel with a NICE breakfast. I brought a tray back to our room with a nice variety of edibles, and two good coffees. Our room was clean and cool. The AC had a new setting for us: Dry. It kept the room nice and not humid, and it was quiet, too. We had a King bed with a mini-fridge and microwave. The Desk area had plenty of outlets for charging gadgets. The bed area could use more outlets for things like CPAP machines. (We went and bought an extension cord.) The sink area had a large counter surface, and the bath area was nice sized with a shower over the tub. Staff was courteous and efficient. The pool is small and was well used. There are several places to eat in the area. There were many families, and many foreign tourists here. Good clean basic hotel in a popular destination.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback.

"I do a good share of traveling and stayed here as a last minute situation. With the 405 night gouge, they really like taking advantage of weary travelers. The don't accept AAA or any other type of discount. The best part of the room was the view of the boardwalk, but everything else was very average or below average for hotel accommodations.Thank you for your feedback. Our prices are not meant to take advantage of weary travelers by any means. In fact, our rates are priced very strategically so we are neither the most expensive, nor the most affordable, property here in Pacific Beach. We set our rates so that we can confidently say that we offer the most value in town - no other property offers as many complimentary amenities and/or as affordable amenities as we do.That being said, room prices on the beach are generally higher than elsewhere because our location is simply unbeatable. Not only is our location unbeatable in San Diego, but there are very few properties situated like ours in all of Southern California.Lastly, prices during peak seasons, like spring break, will always be higher with the higher demand. We're disappointed you didn't find value in your stay with us, but you may find what you're looking for if you try again during the off-season when our rates go as low as 109!Thanks again.",Neutral

"For the price, around 70 a night, it was average. The room had been somewhat remodeled with new bedding, wallpaper, furniture and drapes. The rooms are very small and tight with two beds. Note that two beds will most likely be 2 doubles, not queens. The bathroom needed work, It wasn't the cleanest. Old door and moldy corners. The grounds of the motel are very nice. However, keep in mind that many temporary workers and hotel help obviously live in the motel. Ask for an upstairs room, the lower rooms are loud. And stay away from rooms across from the laundry.

"This is a great hotel, if all you're going to do is sleep there and then be out and about in the French Quarter the rest of the day. The bed was comfy, the rooms were fairly quiet (in June--I have no idea how crazy it gets during Mardi Gras), everything was clean, and the water-pressure in the shower was good. Oh, and the service was great--very, very friendly. And as everyone else notes, it is indeed walking distance to just about anything in the French Quarter or downtown.I would definitely have rated it five stars/excellent, if it weren't for two things, each of which lose it a star:First, to get to our room, we had to walk through the outdoor courtyard. That by itself would be fine, except the courtyard was where everyone went to smoke, and smoke they did. I really don't appreciate having to sacrifice my lungs just to get to my room. They should make the entire property non-smoking.Second, having read the other reviews here about making sure to get a room with a window, we paid extra for a room with a Courtyard or City View. The room we got had nothing of the sort. It did have a window, but that window was elevated at least five feet off the ground and only had a view of the roof of the building next-door. It was fine for us (we just wanted some natural light), but it was definitely not what we reserved.So to sum up: great hotel, just be prepared to inhale some second-hand smoke and don't expect to actually look out your window. (But you're in NOLA! Go outside and see the city instead of looking out your window!)Thank you for sharing your feedback about the French Market Inn, we appreciate your kind words about our staff service and central French Quarter location. We do our best to place our guests in accommodations that meet or exceed their expectations, and apologize that you were disappointed - due to the nature of our historic property, we have a level of variance in our room types. If our employees are alerted to an accommodation issue, we are happy to switch rooms when availability exists. Please know that all of your comments have been passed on to management, we look forward to welcoming you back for your next NOLA getaway.",Neutral
"My husband was staying in this hotel for a bushiness trip. His work had selected it because its a long term stay setup. I found it clean and well located. There is a grocery store and restaurants within walking distance. The room had a small kitchenette and small eating area. The hotel is not overly fancy and does not have a lot of perks like a gym or pool. But its clean and located near the Perimeter mall. The area was also great for walking around and seemed pretty safe.I would like to personally thank you for taking time out to write such wonderful things about your experience at Homestead Atlanta - Perimeter.

What's that on the floor Housekeeping left a little souvenir behind. Don't bother paying more for executive room. Small room with only toilet and small shower in bathroom. Sink outside bathroom. Bright parking lot light at night. Told by one employee when I called the hotel that Sea World had fireworks at night so made special requests for Sea World facing room. They didn't. Breakfast eggs were of the powdered kind. No yogurt. (But then again, I can't complain - it was satisfactory and free.) Pool was basically bordered by parking lot. (Nobody used it during my stay.)

"We travelled fron San Francisco to San Diego at similarly priced hotels and this is my first average review. The beach is beautiful and the location of the hotel is just one short block from the beach. You are charged for Wifi, the breakfast is pastry and coffee tea with creamora, the rooms are dated, and the air- conditioning is noisy. We just used the fan since the nights were cool to drown out the noise. I have stayed at other dated hotels with no air-conditioning, maybe I expected more. They did have complimentary parking and the bathrooms were clean. There was also a pool but when you have an ocean steps away, why botherYes, I guess a few of our rooms are dated, but they will all be new by this time next year, and we have already renovated about half. Each room is different when it comes to a/c noises, and we try to keep up with repairs for the big compressors we have located in our back alley.

When we arrived we were told we would not be on the same floor as someone who had just fronted at reception was given one of our rooms. I protested and they relented but our rooms were not side by side but quite a distance from each other. This was not good enough. The rooms themselves were nice and the hotel very good. Did have a problem with other guests walking past our door in the early morning and talking rather loudly - enough to wake us up. Also the car park directly underneath the rooms was not good.

"I stayed at the Orchard Garden last month, as business took me to San Francisco and there were literally no other hotel rooms available downtown between 75 and 450 per night some huge conference was going on and there was NO hotel availability. So I chose this hotel out of necessity (as I really had no choice), but was pleasantly surprised during my stay. The hotel is green, which I appreciate. Biodegradable bath product packaging (although the products themselves are still full of chemicals, boo), room key controlled lighting (very European), etc. The bathroom floor was heated (huge bonus in the morning) and the room was spacious enough. My view was of another close building, so that left a bit to be desired, and my room smelled of old lady perfume a little. I wasn't able to check out the rooftop garden but heard from a colleague that it's a great spot when the weather is nice. This hotel probably isn't my first choice for future trips to SF, as it was farther from my office than I'd like and I have other favorite hotels in the city, but it's definitely doable and I would stay here again if need be.Thank you for sharing your experience during your recent visit to San Francisco and our Hotel.

"I traveled to Ritz Central Park for my 50th Birthday celebrations with my Mother and my Daughter.... we had this planned for approximately 9 months....Upon arrival we were very impressed with the hotel lobby. Whilst checking in I didnt feel the usual Ritz welcome service I had experienced in other Ritz Hotels. We made our way up to a very pleasant room with a Cava chilling and selection of chocolates and a birthday card welcome which was a lovely touch to the start of our vacation. Our room was not quite ready as the put up bed had not been set up, our arrival was approximately 8pm so I would have thought this would have been done. We hit the shops ( Black Friday). On returning to the hotel all was done. We continued to enjoy our stay at the Ritz which an amazing setting in an ideal location. The doormen where very attentive as we were in and out and nothing was to much trouble for them.Getting ready to go out on Sunday evening I realised an item of jewellery was missing. Security initially could not do enough and we were given access to Club Lounge as we needed to hang around the hotel more than we wanted to to help with investing the incident. Not ideal when we only had a 5 day stay. However, after 24 hours and the item was never found I felt like we were under suspicion. We never heard anything from Security again. Police took statements. On arrival back to the UK we have had to contact Ritz to find out any outcome of their investigation and are still no further on.

These are a little smaller than normal and don't have work desks or in-room safes. My room faced the parking lot behind the hotel and was fairly quiet. On previous visits I didn't have a problem with noise either. I love the room decor which is bright and contemporary. It looks better than most BWs I've visited. Also, there is an extra sink next to the closet space near the door, which works well when there are multiple people in a room.Location. It is on St. Charles with a streetcar stop almost in front of the hotel. St. Charles and its nearby areas have more good restaurants than the French Quarter IMO and the streetcar is an incredibly efficient way of getting to them. Also, the French Quarter is not walking distance from the hotel, but the streetcar takes you to Canal Street, which is the border of the Quarter. The hotel is also quite close to Loyola and Tulane Universities as well as Audubon Park/Zoo. This particular area of St. Charles is residential. It should be noted that part of the hotel is built on top of a restaurant, Superior Grill. This is convenient, but it enhances the possibility for noise. It hasn't bothered me, but I've never been in a room directly over it.Cleanliness. The room was reasonably clean. I was there for a half-marathon and spent more time than normal in the bathroom to ice my legs. I noticed that the bathroom wasn't exactly spotless, but it wasn't anything you'd notice unless you spent 30-45 minutes in there looking around. Service. The front desk staff struck me as nice, but in a couple of cases simply weren't able to accommodate me. I arrived around 3:15PM and my room was not ready. Since the hotel was fully booked, they couldn't give me another room. I waited in the lobby for a little more than an hour and two calls by the clerk to the housekeeper and my room still wasn't ready. The clerk agreed to hold my bag while I went next door to Superior Grill to eat dinner. I returned about 6:30PM and my room was ready. I was not the only person waiting for a room. (Throughout my stay, I noticed that housekeeping seemed to occur late in the day, about 1-4 PM. It wasn't difficult to notice because the housekeeper on our floor blasted music in the rooms she was cleaning.) Second, I asked the front desk for some information about street closures occurring that weekend and they weren't aware of them. It's a relatively minor issue, but there were multiple people asking and they never got answers.Sleep Quality. My room was quiet and the bed relatively decent.Notes. The surface on the second floor slopes a bit which can feel weird initially. They have a bookshelf with books for guests to read while there.",Neutral

"First the positive - check in was a breeze, the room was in great condition, it was quiet, the air conditioning was great, the breakfast was good, there's food nearby although many places don't stay open very late, they even provide mouthwash with the free toiletries which was a nice touch, they welcome their HHonors members very well, had nice 12 shuttle to the port, and the free airport shuttle was prompt when called.Now the problem - they tried to kick us out of our a room a day early. They didn't even tell us, they just gave someone else a keycard that gave them access to our room. Thankfully we were there when they tried to gain entry so we were able to stop them. The other guest went back to the lobby and the front desk called us and told us we weren't supposed to be there and to get out. I explained that I had booked for 2 days. They accused me of lying so I offered to present proof of my reservation, they put me on hold and when they eventually came back they accused me of checking out a day early. I told them that was clearly untrue since I was still in the room. They muttered an apology and hung up on me. If it hadn't been for this one interaction I would have rated them excellent but given that they put our safety and property at risk and made accusations that were untrue I simply can't rate them better than average. It was one thing but the severity was too serious. They didn't do anything to make up for it. I mentioned it in the survey they sent me but there was no follow-up.",Neutral

Our room was clean, quiet, good size, with a microwave and refrigerator. We were in the third building on the parking lot side and did not have street noise. There is a guest laundry, nice pool area, plenty of free parking, a good complimentary breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful. As others have mentioned, the hotel is a couple miles from town and too far to walk in the heat. We drove into town and parked at the garage. Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property. We take all reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests. We agree that we are a little far for the night life and the other action of the island. With that as of May 1st we have added a shuttle service to get our Guests to and from the Old Town Area.

I was surprised that I was at fault, by not calling them to ask for a room.But this was not enough to mark my stay. I left the make the room light on cause I wanted to come back and catchup on my sleep deprivation and left to go to my breakfast and then to meetings and returned at 4PM to find the room unmade! I called and asked the room to be made. They came up, and actually noticed the light to make the room and I asked if they acted on the light or not. They indicated to me it was best to call.

"The hotel is clean and the rooms are modern. Price is reasonable. Location is close to Universal but a very busy intersection. Lost a couple of stars due to the following:1) Shuttle is overbooked and was never available for us to use since it was always sold out. The booking system does not require you to identify yourself, I believe many people overbook. The shuttle serves at least 4 hotels so a 5 minute trip ends up being 30 minutes to the park and is part of the reason the shuttle was sold out.2) Breakfast was mediocre and very crowded. Same items every day with little or no variety. By the 4th day we went to IHOP. Very crowded at times.3) While hotel staff were helpful, the service staff for the shuttle tickets were not. Service was poor and they were mostly interested in selling or up-selling park tickets. Frustrating to wait in line every morning behind many people buying tickets only to find out that the shuttle was sold out for the day.4) This seems picky but wi-fi was slow and spotty. Non-secured wi-fi usually is.We've stayed in far worse but we'll try another hotel next time as there are a lot of good choices in the area.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We are glad that you liked our rooms and location but we apologize that you had difficulty with the shuttle service. Unfortunately during peak seasons the shuttles fill up quickly. It is possible to book your shuttle the day before your departure for the parks which would help to guarantee a seat. The ticket desk you are referring to is operated by Universal as are the shuttles to Universal. There are several departures each morning, but we realize during this busy month the early departures sold out quickly. Another option is to ask the front desk to call a cab which is only 8.00 and will get you to the park quickly. Parking at Universal can be difficult during high season as well and will cost 17.00 so a cab is sometimes the best option. We hope that you will visit us again.",Neutral

"I recently stayed at the Best Western Hacienda for the week, and I cannot rave enough about the great location of the hotel. Located right in the heart of Old Town San Diego, there are great Mexican restaurants and shopping right outside your door. Unfortunately, the location is the only thing I would rate as Excellent.The rooms were a bit out of date, they could definitely use some updates, especially in the decor-area. The rooms were very, very dark. Not what I would expect in sunny San Diego.I believe my room was especially noisy. I stayed in the 700 building which backs up to the restaurants on the main street. Every morning at 5:30, the garbage truck would back up outside my window and unload the dumpster. Even on Sundays. I also had an adjoining room to a family of four. I could hear every single thing through the door between our rooms, including bathroom noises (not to be too graphic...)We also booked our rooms with the El Presidente package. It entitled us to a free breakfast and free dinner (with two free drinks). The breakfast was decent, especially the days when they had French Toast which was really good. The dinners were okay, with a very limited menu. We chose to eat in town quite a few nights and pass up the free dinners. Strangely, being a part of the El Presidente package also seemed to limit where you were allowed to sit in the restaurant. It would have been nice to eat outside.Overall, I think the hotel is a good value. The location is great and within walking distance of a lot of great sites.

"The hotel itself is pretty nice, with a cool bar downstairs and a lovely staff. The building is quite old and the elevator was extremely small, so for people with claustrophobia it will be very difficult. When we approached the room we smelled a very odd and a bit gross smell, almost like urine. We where told that we where going to get a more spacious and bigger room, but when we saw the room i did wonder what a normal room would look like, because it was not big. There was a lot of dust on the floor and it almost looked like it had not been cleaned properly! We found black hair in the shower and it did not look appealing to take a shower. The next day when we came back to the room later, the dust and the hair was gone... the air condition was very load and where put right next to the bed near the window, so the person lying there would have trouble sleeping at night. The hotel is very close to union square and it took only a couple of minutes to walk. The staff was helpful and nice, which we appreciated a lot! The library bar near the lobby was very cool and the music there was amazing!Hotel Rex was very expensive! But I guess that is the price in san franscico, especially for a hotel near the union square..Hello651, thank you so much for staying with us and kind words about our staff.

"We were in San Francisco for 6 days, and we stayed at the Monarch.They were nice enough to check us in early,but the room had a slight smell and a view of the apartment that was 10 feet away.

"This was our first stay at this resort. We stayed at Westin KOR last year and loved it, so decided to give it a try.We booked a 1 week stay through an owner on redweek. He was wonderful - very helpful in linking our 2 extra nights though the resort so we wouldnt have to move. He did tell me he had requested one of the bldg 8 high floor one bedrooms 1 year in advance, as these have the best view. When I checked in the front desk told me since I wasnt an owner and elite member I did not get preference and I was l placed in a 5th floor room in bldg 7 facing the courtyard and other rooms. They moved us mid stay to bldg 8, but through this I came to find out there are very few 1 bedrooms and they all have poor views or face the pool where loud noise can be heard until late evening. So, if you are looking to book a 1 bedroom beware. Youre better off at KOR where there are ocean front and ocean view 1 bedrooms. Many at Nanea face the parking structure. That being said the rooms are new and well appointed. The shower in the the 1 bedroom was not great... tub with curtain. At KOR they have the nice walk in rain shower, double sinks and a large tub.We did come here the week of Spring break, so expected it to be busy, but it was a bit on the insane side. The pool was packed everyday and seemed over crowded. They seemed under staffed as it was difficult to find a server on the pool deck and it was much faster to go to the bar and order. The other thing we noticed was the lack of cleanliness of the place. Trash everywhere, no one emptying the overflowing trash cans. The lounge chairs were pretty filthy, clearly not wiped down. The beach here is nice, but as others have noted, smaller and rockier than at KOR. We did enjoy snorkeling off the beach everyday with little kids. The waves are gentle and great for learning. We also had spectacular whale action everyday.End game, even though its older we preferred KOR and will book there in the future. Aloha baflier,E kala mai.

"Firstly, the staff were great, no issues there. Extremely friendly and attentive.My primary concerns had to do with the room appointments. I felt like the hotel had undergone a fairly recent conversion but more work towards soundproofing and modernization is in order. I stayed in a Junior Suite and I'm 6'1 and I felt like a giant in this room.The bathroom was very, very small. There were no vents or fans in the bathroom so moisture buildup was a definite issue. The room furniture while stylish was very low to the floor and not so functional or comfortable if you are taller.I slept in the murphy bed and I felt like it would have really benefitted from a good pillow-top pad addition, it was quite uncomfortable. The floors were very creaky and we could hear our adjoining neighbor's conversations quite clearly in the room.Also, there is a small inside courtyard but it's not accessible to any of the guests and rooms on this side are probably quieter but they are darker.Many of the guests (my party included) noticed that the elevators didn't indicate whether they were going up or down until you were in the elevator having selected the floors and it resulted in some unexpected travels. Valet parking is pricey at 40/night and they recommend calling about 30 mins before you need to leave and I'd heed that advice.At this hotel's price point, my expectations start to rise and while this hotel is an ok value for San Francisco, I think a little tweak here and there would go a long way in making this a solid mid-range hotel in Downtown SF.Dear Lightning79,Thank you for sharing your comments on Trip Advisor.

"I've stayed at other Fairfield Inns and my overall experience has been good. If you're looking for a very basic, nice hotel, this is a good one. But, there are a few caveats. The room was cold, and the bedding is extremely minimal - just a sheet and a very light cover. Upon requesting a couple of extra blankets, I was told that they weren't sure they had any. Luckily, a nice gentleman showed up at the door with blankets a few minutes later. Although the sign in the bathroom says that if you hang up your towels you can help the hotel to be green by not washing and replacing them every day, this wasn't the case. Each and every day, there were new towels. Also, the toiletries were never replenished, so I had to request more. On the last night of my stay, I discovered a silverfish and an ant on the bathroom floor. This might suggest that the hotel do a little more cleaning to prevent this type of incident in the future.I used the hotel's shuttle to go to the airport Marriott location for dinner one night. This was a very convenient option, and the driver was very nice and accommodating.The breakfast was great (breakfast sandwiches, waffles, fruit, oatmeal, etc,) and service was extremely friendly!Hello,Thank you very much for taking the time to provide your feedback.

"This is one of the hotels our company uses for our Dallas airport stays, so we stay here about four times a month. I have mixed feelings. In general, I like the rooms a lot. They are clean and have fairly modern finishes. They have a good sized kitchenette with a large refrigerators, however, many of them are broken. Instead of fixing them, they have placed a lot of small fridges in the room as well, but not all, so if you need a fridge check to see if it works after checking into your room. Also, a lot of the rooms have Air conditioners that don't work properly, this is a big problem in Dallas in the summertime. On my last stay, two nights ago, I had one of theses rooms with a faulty A/C unit and broken fridge. The A/C seemed to work in the first hour, so I unpacked all my things and it was late in the evening, about 11pm. By the time I noticed it started to get very hot in the room it was too late to pack up all my things ( I had an extremely long work day and was exhausted ). I called the front desk and no one answered the first call even though I let it ring for awhile. I tried back and a very surly man answered like he was very bothered and annoyed. I told him the A/C wasn't working and also the fridge was broken. Silence. I could almost here the 'So, what do you want me to do about it' in his thoughts! After an awkward silence, he said to hold on. He then sent someone up to change my room which I declined because of the time and effort. That same night checking in, there was a different clerk who seemed um, medicated let's say, she was very harried and distracted and had trouble checking a two of us in, she couldn't seem to get her thoughts straight, it was pretty strange. I would hope they could get their staff to act in a more professional manner. I have to say their shuttle drivers are awesome, very prompt and friendly. Maybe they should put the shuttle drivers behind the front desk and make the front desk clerks the shuttle drivers Just an idea.",Neutral
"This property is a very typical Marriott with capable staff (aside from housekeeping) and nicely finished interiors. I have stayed here twice within a month and both experiences were pleasant, especially their marketing director (Peggy, I believe her name was) whom I met in the lobby. She went out of her way to find information for my colleagues and I to make our visit exceptional. However, housekeeping staff requires some further training on how and when to enter a room. Apparently my Do Not Disturb sign had fallen out of the card reader. At 8 am sharp while I was still soundly asleep I awoke to a scratching sound at the door, followed by her abrupt attempt at entry. She was unable to get in because of the metal flap safety device, and yelled. I asked her to come back later (preferably, after I checked out an hour later) and received a snotty sigh of disgust in return. Slleping in one's paid hotel room is not too much to ask.",Neutral
"On a recent trip to San Diego we booked online at this hotel. On arrival we found that what we had booked was not available. We had booked a king suite for 2 nights and they had us down for 2queen beds for only one night, after some discussion with the front desk a second night was arranged in the same room. Each evening on our return to the hotel we found that our key cards did not work, normally this is not a big deal but this hotel is not like others we have stayed at we're all of the rooms are in the same building. The rooms in this hotel are all in different buildings so a lot of walking is required.

On our last evening there we tried several vending machines to get a bottle of Pepsi but all were out of service , so we went to the fron desk to ask if there was any way to get a bottle and we were told to drive to a store somewhere ourselves to pick it up. The person on the desk was very rude about it. All in all the location was great but the service and the noise outside are room was terribl. On our last morning at breakfast all of the dishes were dirty.We are disheartened to read your review. I'd like to apologize on behalf of our staff for any inconveniences you encountered while with us. It is disappointing that your experience did not reflect our usual high standards and we understand your frustration. It is constructive feedback, such as yours, that really help us get a clear perspective of the areas we need to improve. If another trip calls for a stay in San Diego, please contact me through the hotel. I would like to have our leadership team manage your reservation in a personalized manner. Thank you for taking the time to address these issues and we hope to welcome you back again.",Neutral
"The best part of the hotel is probably the bar/restaurant staff. Leslie in the bar is fantastic! She was attentive, social, and just really on her job with a great attitude to boot.Unfortunately, Leslie can't work everyday. We met the other bartender on our last night and it was a horrible experience. The breakfast staff was good. The food in the restaurant was much better than expected. The location is great (minus the construction).The front desk staff was mediocre at best. While they were nice...nothing was above par.Your feedback is much appreciated. Were disappointed to hear that your experience in the restaurant was less than par on your last night. We have brought this to the attention of our bartenders and front desk associates to ensure they all deliver consistent quality service to our guests. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you choose us again.",Neutral
"We stayed at the Bienville for our weekend in New Orleans. The location is great, you are far enough away from the noise of Bourbon Street and walking distance to just about everything, but there is a train that goes by twice a night and sounds its horn :) The staff are very kind and helpful. Our room was not as nice as I had hoped. The carpet was really stained and dirty and the cleanliness of the bathroom was not great. There is only one very tiny elevator for four floors. Not sure that I would book again here with all the other choices in the Quarter.Thank you for taking the time to comment regarding your recent visit to New Orleans and Bienville HouseI regret that you did not receive the level of service we are capable of providing and I apologize.

Breakfast in the same restaurant wasaverage but expected per the usual expectations for BW. The always present tip jar. I do tip but do not care for the begging bowl. Does not seem classy. TV so, so.

"Hotel staff was awesome during my entire 4 day stay! The hotel however, needs serious updating and plumbing maintenance. Decor is okay, rooms are small, floors/walls are quite thin. I could here the activities and conversations of those in nearby rooms. Insufficient ventilation in bathroom causing serious fog for hours. Area is heavily populated with homeless people with a community centers across the street from hotel. Wifi was horrible. No microwave. Refrig in select rooms. Elevator issues due to being so outdated. No breakfast, but coffee available 24/7 in lobby along with knats. Again front desk guys and housekeeping were very nice. Easy walk to union square, clubs, bars and food. Management really needs to invest in updates to the property's plumbing, wifi, guest accommodations to include refrig/microwaves and the environment immediately around the hotel as much as possible. Some guest room views are an open space shared with the apt complex next door and displays trash and a view into tenants' apts. I paid too much for my experience.We are obviously very pleased with your report of the great service that you received at our hotel. We do occupy an older building most of the buildings in this area are quite old, but we work tirelessly to ensure quality standards are upheld for our guests.

She didnt, maid knocks on door the next morning saying Im scheduled to check out that morning. Dishwasher very loud. Run it when youre gone.This is a decent, but underperforming Hilton property in need of updating, but was a disappointing stay for a Hilton property. This is a VERY competitive market so it may be wise to look elsewhere, but if you end up here its manageable. Overall I would give this property an 82/100 and an 80/100 for value. I would likely look elsewhere next time Im in the area, but since Im a Hilton Diamond member, I would end up at a Hilton property somewhere. In all fairness, I did mention my concerns to the front desk staff and the General Manager called me to follow up and made an adjustment on my bill which goes a long way in my book or I would have rated this property lower. He is part of the new ownership and they are working to improve the property and upgrade the staff.",Neutral

"Hotel is definitely outdated. Room was quite large, bed was comfortable, but furnishings, bathroom fixtures are old. Best thing about it was price which includes free parking and the location was great - close to Fisherman's Wharf, Starbucks and a Walgreens. It's a 10-15 minute walk to Washington Square area in North Beach with lots of great restaurants.

"I wanted to love this hotel. They have a great location - it was convenient to everything! Sadly, that was the best thing about this Comfort Suites. I'm not difficult to please - I don't require that much. But, when I went to the first room I was given, the door was open. The halls are so long, I couldn't see who was in the room, but I certainly wasn't going to walk in to determine who it was. I went back to the lobby to be told that it was probably housekeeping and that I should go in anyone. Ummm, no thank you. What if it's not housekeeping They called and tried to find out and, after 5 minutes or so, I asked if I could just get a new room. They did it, but why not come up with that on their own without me asking for it Three times during my two night stay, I had to get my key reactivated. My room wasn't as clean as I would expect it. There was hair that wasn't mine in the shower. My sheets weren't completely clean. It was just disappointing.Dear Julie G,Thank you for your recent review. I do apologize for the issues you had at the hotel. This is not a common occurrence at the property. We recently hired a few new housekeepers and they have made a few errors. They will be retrained and the issues will be corrected going forward. Our key cards do deactivate if they are placed near a credit card, cell phone or magnate. We try to suggest placing the key card away from items like these. Also keeping it in the paper key card envelope when not in use.I hope you will try us out again.

"I stayed two nights at Hotel Felix - the room was a bit small but the bed was large and comfortable. The lighting in my room was at the end of the bed, so the far end of the room was a little dim, I had to turn the desk lamp on to see my suitcase. Also, some of the spotlights in the ceiling above the bed were not aligned with their hole (they had come loose and left a gap) which didn't help the lighting situation. The rest of the room was ok for a short stay but any longer and it could be a little uncomfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful and it's ideally located. You're only a few minutes walk from the L train stations. The bar and restaurant options in the hotel are quite limited - you have to go next door to the local bar for a drink and the lobby doubles as a sushi bar. I'd recommend if you're in town for a short stay or business but not for a longer visit.Hi Knoggers - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us.

"New, clean and mostly friendly staff. The pool is not big enough for the resort and want that inviting. Kaanapali and the Resort Spa are better pools. It is says you can share facilities between the Westin properties and Sheraton. That is incorrect. You can not use the pools at Sheraton or Resort Spa which was awkward arriving thinking you could. Pool staff confirmed they get this situation happening all the time. Room service shuts down at 8pm. Crazy for an international brand!

"This was a very inexpensive hotel my coworker and I booked, not knowing the status of the area.The staff was friendly, which helps when realizing what sort of neighborhood it's located in.The pros: it's a cheap hotel, the Bart transit subway is not too far of a walk. Busses are on all surrounding streets. You're surrounded by many different restaurants of all varieties of ethnic and American foods.The rooms are large and the beds are comfy. The room thermostats don't work well so good luck with controlling your room temperature.Ice machine is in the garage but easy to get to.The ConsElevators are slow.The rooms are extremely thin so, if you don't mind noise and traffics orchestras, then you're good. Don't book here if you want silence or scenic views.It's an area of vagrants, homeless, and transients that may make you wary of wanting to wander around in the evenings. It didn't bother me but I could see it for those who can't handle it.I can sleep through anything so, I was at home.The WIFI works and I've not had problems doing work. Hot water is great when taking a shower.If I had a choice to stay here again, I'm might, but make it the last resort.Walgreens is only a block up to get last minutes sundries. Several coffee shops are available, and there are close nearby markets to get beer or cigs.None of the vagrants ever bothered me and I did not feel unsafe like a few of the other reviews I've read prior to booking.I did feel that this hotel can be better if the owners took some money and time to repaint, upgrade the plug in outlets, and added some affordable bathroom upgrades. More importantly, you're in SF, let this place be where you sleep, and enjoy the wonderful city.:)",Neutral
"Allegro was not really what I expected. Rooms hallways were dull, drab and darkish. Bathrooms were extremely small, had to remove the garbage can to move around without tripping over it. Bar/Lounge area was just average. Not a lot of sitting area, if there's a large group. Bar tenders were nice. For the price I did expect more. Location was however good, as it was towards central downtown, and many thing were within walking distance, minuets from the rail-train. If you are into Old Historical Hotel, this may be the hotel for you, but I'm not.Because this was a business trip, and I did spend very little time in the hotel and room, it was average. If on vacation would definitely choose a more modern Hotel.Thanks for taking time to review your stay with us. I'm disappointed to see you did not enjoy your stay with us. As we are in a historic 1920's building, we aimed to put a modern twist on the classic art deco decor of that era, however we understand not everyone can appreciate that style, however I'm glad to see you were able to take advantage of our excellent location.

"As part of our honeymoon we stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 6 days. New York was amazing as always and the location of the hotel is just great, just of Central Park South. Initially we were given the wrong room and, despite having been in contact with the customer service manager up front (both regarding the honeymoon and the fact we are platinum members) our special requests were not followed up.But, upon contacting the front desk on these points, the Ritz Carlton staff made every effort in giving us a great stay and provided us with complimentary drinks and dinner.The fact the overall score comes to average is noy only due to the disappointment while checking in, but also due to the fact that the Ritz prices are high. And the overall customer experience you get in return is just not up to par. The rooms are nice, but small and in need for remodelling. As are the hallways and some of the public spaces. Furthermore we would have expected more qualified staff as well. At slightly lower rates we would have given the Ritz a score of 4. But, again, good hotel in a great location. Oh and by the way, the beds are simply devine.Dear Sjors257,Thank you for your feedback and please accept my deepest apology as the image of our hotel was not up to your expectation.

"We found the Baymont Inn Suites through the list of Wyndham family of hotels, since we are Wyndham Rewards members and were looking to increase our points. Since we only needed a room for one night (less than 12 hours total) and for us and our 2 kids, we didn't need much, but they had a King suite with two rooms and a hideaway. This suited our needs. Unfortunately, the end result wasn't worth the money we paid for the room.To begin, the hotel is situated immediately next door to a local Mexican restaurant, and we got the feeling the hotel staff and the restaurant staff hang out often together in the hotel lobby or near the front desk when business is slow. There seemed to be a definite camaraderie with friendly conversation taking place when I checked in. To be fair, it was after 11pm when we arrived, and I know this changes the look and feel of a property.Checkin was smooth and easy and our room was in the main building on the 2nd floor. No elevators, though, so we had to lug 3 large suitcases and our 4 carry-on bags upstairs and down the hall without a cart. Also, just past the front desk and before the stairs there was a small room with a glass window and open door full of miscellaneous boxes, materials, and other paraphernalia, giving it a haphazard appearance.Once we arrived at our room, the key showed green but the door wouldn't open. We learned we needed to turn the handle up instead of down due to a low-battery keyed entrance.From the pictures on the web site, the rooms appeared much larger than they really are. Main room had mini-fridge, microwave on a counter, 2 chairs and a hideaway couch right next to each other, and a single dresser on which the TV sat, all in close proximity with not much room to move once the bed was unfolded. The entrance into the king bedroom was an opening which looked like they took duplicate rooms and cut a hole in the wall, because it was a mirror-reflection of the main room. The only difference is there was a closet area with no door and a king bed. No extra pillows or blankets, and the pillows on the king bed immediately flattened, thereby lacking support. The bed itself was quite hard and unforgiving.The rooms were clean, and the windows had nice treatments, but the lacks in other areas overshadowed that. If you're looking for an affordable stay with sufficient continental breakfast and basic amenities, this place would work. Plus, there are Wyndham Rewards points for your stay!",Neutral
"This is my second stay at this location and due to it's price of under 100.00 it fits my budget. On my first stay the room was spotless, unfortunately this time around I can see that they just ripped out the old TV's because there is particle board shaving from the entertainment center all over the furniture and part of the carpet...the good news is brand new flat screen..the bad news is that the front desk told me that there were no remote controls for the new HDTV's and you could not change the channels...it was programmed on the welcome screen. So the rooms are worn with sagging couches nicked and torn wall paper, old furniture and brand new HDTV's that are useless...I think I'll look elsewhere on my next business trip to San Diego. I am a Platinum Choice Hotels member and stayed over 25 nights with Comfort Suites across the Western US last year and this is not the standard of every other CS I have stayed at..this should be a Comfort Inn.",Neutral

"I checked into this hotel this past week for a one night stay in Philadelphia. The hotel has a GREAT central location, and is located in the heart of everything.As a Hyatt 'Diamond' member, i found this hotel very confusing. It is clearly a grand, historic property. The lobby and common areas reflect this. The hallways on the room floors are a flashback to years gone by. The bold patterned wall papers and bright green colors brought memories of the 70's and my grandmothers taste at the time. I kept thinking Jackie O. might walk around the corner at any moment.Conversely, the rooms were remodeled in a contemporary, stark style reminiscent of hotels like W. They style in one area says one thing, and then a sudden CONTRAST that was not good. The room designs were a bit cheap, cold. It was VERY odd. I had a corner 'suite', which was HUGE. I was upgraded, so i feel bad complaining....but it was a VERY odd hotel stay.It felt like they didn't have the money to tie things together by remodeling the dated corridors at the same time as the roomsIt also reminded me of one other Hyatt hotel....the Grand Hyatt Buckhead in Atlanta. This classic hotel had their lobby remodeled in a very contemporary manner that didn't match anything else in the hotel. Crazy.The service was 'OK'. My check in was fine, but trays stayed on the corridors....and several room service tables were in place for the entire 24 hours i was in the hotel. Check in was fine. I tried to eat upstairs, but got frustrated at the crowd from a wedding....and left.Elevators were slow.The hotel is clean. Its OK.... The design team should be fired guys. Really awful.Sorry....Thank you for taking the time to review our historic hotel and we hope you had a wonderful holiday season. Even more so, thank you for your loyalty to Hyatt. We completely understand what it takes to attain Diamond status and truly do appreciate your patronage to our brand. That said, it is truly disappointing to hear we did not exceed your expectations on your visit to the Bellevue. You had mentioned our current design in your review and we can certainly understand your point of view. In 2010 only our suites went under renovation thus leading to the style difference between the corridors and the room you stayed in. We are very much looking forward to a full room renovation in 4th quarter of 2015. All standard guest rooms will be renovated with a style an elegance to match this amazing historic building. Furthermore the soft goods in our suites will be replaced or refinished at this time as well. We believe this renovation will take our hotel to another level. In regards to trays left in the hallway, we have already addressed with our In Room Dining team and we will obviously look to improve in this area. Once again, thank you for you feedback, as it is crucial to our success. If you would like to talk further about your stay, please feel free to message me privately so we could arrange time.

"Nice location, nice looking hotel, but needs some sound proofing! I was in a King room just off the elevator lobby, which is marble, could hear people talking outside and in the room next to us as if they were in our room. Doors slam shut so hard we woke up every time our neighbor came in or out. Room was nice size, bed was a little hard for my taste. Great view from our 24th floor room. Don't think I would stay here again unless there is an update to the building in terms of sound proofing. Valet was overwhelmed the day we arrived (large convention in the hotel) It took a trip around the block since we drove past the line of cars waiting, and a 20 minute wait to get parked. Elevators were over taxed at busy times due to a full hotel and busy convention. Staff was great and friendly.Thank you for your recent stay at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. I am glad you liked the property and our backyard. I am sorry to hear you did not get a decent night sleep due to the noise.

"I booked this hotel based on the great reviews it got, and that people seemed to feel like it was in a 'great location'. After staying one night, I have to disagree. I suppose if you are staying and you have a car, it probably is a good location because it's really close to the highway- but we only stayed one night, so we didn't have a car, and the location was terrible. There was nothing to do near the hotel, I am not from the area, so it was hard for me to tell if this is a 'good area' or not, but I was not about to walk around alone. Our hotel room was clean and comfortable, but we only had one working outlet in the room. All of the other outlets were a major fire hazard as they only allowed the plugs to go in half-way. Breakfast was fine, but crowded and I couldn't get the wifi to work. As we were checking out, we watched a mouse swimming around in the pool. With all the being said- every single hotel employee that I spoke with was extremely kind and helpful. They are definitely doing customer service the right way!",Neutral

"I read a bunch of other reviews before I came here, so I knew the parking would be bad. Therefore, we never moved our car and it wasn't really an issue. Plus, why would anyone need to drive This hotel is literally across the street from the Disneyland gates and between the parking lot (which has a Denny's) and a three block walk (to a mall) there are at least 100 shops and restaurants. No car required! We're not Denny's people, so we had some excellent meals at the restaurants in GardenWalk. The location is amazing for the price we paid, but don't expect anything more than that. We got a major attitude from the front desk when we checked in. In response to have a nice day the front desk agent responded with I'll try. Not exactly the response you expect from people in hospitality. The next morning we tried to get into the safe (which they charge you for regardless of whether or not you intend to use it) and, upon trying to open it, it got stuck. We spent our morning calling the front desk several times to send someone up to help us with it, who just assumed we had forgotten the key, though we explained many times the key was in there, it just wasn't working. Turns out, the door hinges were weak and the door wasn't sitting right. The maintance people said (who were very nice) said they would come back and open it again anytime we needed it, but, seeing how long it took the first time, we decided to just risk leaving our stuff out instead. Finally, breakfast. This is what brings my review down to a 3. I wasn't expecting much, but I would like more than corn flakes and stale danish if you are advertising breakfast. Also, the part that really really really bothered me: Everything is styrofoam! Every drink cup, every bowl, every plate they use is just killing the environment. Futhermore, their tiny maze of tables gets packed, but there are signs saying not to take things out of the room. Do they expect guests to sit on each others laps!!! Oh, and by 8:30, there is nothing left to eat (except corn flakes, which I had every day). This is is more frustrating by the fact that both days there was service person just sitting in there. Not sure what her job was...So, bottom line, if you're just looking for a place that is close to the park and this is the cheapest, go for it, just keep your expectations very low, plan on walking, and bring your own cups bowls. :)",Neutral

"Let me start out by saying that my buddies and I always stay at this hotel because of its location and how spacious. the room offer a lot of space and we like the fact that they have 2 bedrooms and 2 baths. the employees at the front desk were cordial and checked us in quickly. when I got up stair to the room, I immediately checked to see if the heat and hot water was working. i had read in a previous review that a guest was placed in a room that didn't have heat or hot water. I was fortunate because mine were working fine. although the maid service came in every morning to change the linen and towels, they don't dust, sweep or clean at all. fortunately for me, I travel with a can of Lysol and bought a spray bottle of bleach from the target up the street before using the tub or sink. I use the Lysol to spray down the mattress, linen in every hotel I visit, not just this one. I used the bleach to spray down the walls and tubs before utilizing them.the new dcor in the room is nice. the toilet in one bathroom shifted when a friend of mine used it. yes! the toilet actually moved while he was sitting on it. fortunately for us, there was another bathroom we could use and we did. the window in the room was broken. we opened the window but had to do some maneuvering to get it to close.the cleaning women do a deplorable job cleaning these rooms. in the room we were in, the top of the refridgerator had trash or some type of debris that should have been noticeable to the cleaning crew. also in the kitchen cabinet, there was an unused needle with an alcohol swab next to it.it they cleaned and dusted this hotel a lot better, im sure the reviews would be a lot better. this hotel is very affordable and its right in the heart of buckhead. any and everything you could possibly want is within a short distance.I would recommend travelers to stay here, just be prepared to deal with a room that is partially clean. but, is very spacious and in the heart of everything. I will, without hesitation, stay at this property again.Allow me to start by thanking you for acknowledging our front desk staff and Im very pleased to hear they were courteous and able to get you checked in expeditiously. I am however, sorry for the housekeeping issues you encountered once arriving to your room. We understand that sometimes guests feel better when they themselves do a little extra sanitizing of a room if you will, but it is our goal to make 100 sure that is never a necessity for a guest. We have spoken with our housekeeping staff and will be making the proper changes and ensure they are better trained on what needs to be done so our guests are satisfied. Thank you again for choosing to stay with us, as we know you have many options to choose from. We hope you will return again in the very near future.",Neutral
"Stayed early June for six nights and disappointed that pool was closed when I arrived and remained closed for the whole of my stay, as this was one of the reasons I choose this hotel, location being the other reason.I was then allocated a room on top floor and immediately noticed an irritating humming noise and I wondered if it might have been air con units on roof and rang down to reception. A maintenance guy came up and said that it was same on all floors - after putting up with this for two nights I checked out lower floors and found this was not the case!! I went to reception and they agreed to move me to a lower floor, which was much quieter.I have complained about these problems but response from hotel has been less than satisfactory!On the plus side the hotel is in an excellent location, five minutes walk from Amtrak station, five minutes walk from Little Italy, and less than 10 minutes walk from the Bay with all its attractions. Rooms are of a reasonable quality, with decent amenities, if a little tired. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not great but was satisfactory and plentiful and staff were pleasant.",Neutral
"The room decor is dated and somewhat shabby, but this can be overlooked given the room cost and location. The Inn is within walking distance to shops and restaurants on Union Street and Fort Mason. You can get to Union Square, the Mission, Hayes Valley or North Beach in 15 minutes via Muni bus routes just a couple of blocks from the hotel. We used routes 47, 49, and 30. It was only a 15 minute walk from the northern end of the Powell-Mason cable car line. This is a good base for exploring Pacific Heights, the Marina, and Russian Hill. The room linens are clean, parking is free, and there are newish refrigerators and microwaves in the room. If you don't plan on spending much time in your room and prefer to spend money on dining and entertainment, this is a good option. If you're in town on a Friday, walk up to Fort Mason for great food at the Off the Grid food truck street fair.",Neutral
We have stayed in a lot hotels around the Perimeter Center in Atlanta. I thought I would try the Hampton Inn as the price was 65. The first thing my husband said the bathroom smells and that makes me think it might not be clean. I opened a sample perfume vial and that covered the odor. We were going to be out the room most of the day and evening and leave the next morning so we didn't ask to change rooms. The furniture was banged upped and looked as it needed to be replace. The carpet looked new. With all of the hotels around the area whose rates are under 100 on weekends we will stay somewhere next time.,Neutral
"The hotel and room was very clean and looked exactly like the photos. However the furniture was very stiff and uncomfortable. The hotel is at least 15 minutes away from beach not including traffic (30 minutes with traffic). Parking is ridiculous so the additional 20 a day for parking is worth it versus the risk of being towed overnight for 200. Overall the condo was awesome for the extremely low price and I will recommend to anyone who is vacationing on a budget.

"As with most Mission Valley area hotels, the location is good.The rooms are very aged. Definitely time for some refurbishing (which I think is happening soon). The morning breakfast is pretty nice with a good variety of foods for everyone.Parking is pretty tight if you get there late. Parking in the back is really hard with a larger vehicle.

"We stayed one night January 4, 2018, after an overnight flight from Europe. This is not a typical Hilton and needs renovating. Our room was spacious but the tub faucet dripped all night and the mini-fridge made so much noise we had to unplug it to sleep.The front desk personnel were both excellent.The morning breakfast is not included but I reserved months in advance for a weekend deal. For 169.00 USD we had the room and breakfast for two. This arrangement for breakfast is just odd. It is not serve yourself, but not a sit down restaurant arrangement either. You get part of your own food and they serve you other items that are just sitting there anyway. For instance, coffee is right there in the lobby but a waitress asks to bring it to you. We went early for our meal and all three attendants were just standing around waiting for us to need something. It was awkward and uncomfortable.We travel a lot and expect to serve ourselves for breakfast unless it is a restaurant experience. Hilton needs to take a second look at their program.The area has many hotels to choose from after a flight from MCO.

"Hotel is ok, rooms are nice and big. They have a full fridge, dishwasher, two flat screen tvs and two elements for cooking. Also, plates, pots, pans, ect. It's quiet. Free breakfast. Had an issue with the parking, below is part of my email to Marriott. I initially bid on a one night stay, after successfully winning the bid I was prompted to extend my stay. I was happy to do so after reviewing the location of the hotel, the free breakfast and most importantly the free parking. Because of the two separate reservations, I had to re-check in again for the second night, no big deal. When checking in for the second night I was asked if we had a car with us, which we did. We were informed of the 23 dollar parking fee. I mentioned to the front desk clerk, that it might be on file that I have an email from my successful bid that clearly states the parking was free. (We had the same issue the first night of check in, but I just showed my email and the free parking was granted) The front desk manager Jill took note of the situation and jumped in. Saying very loudly, No, NO, NO! You Priceline People do NOT get free parking, never! It was a little embarrassing to us, that we were being referred to, actually we were being yelled at for using Priceline for our reservation. We mentioned the free parking was one of our main reasons for extending our stay for two nights. Again we were reminded that us Priceline People do not ever get free parking . I asked if I should run up and get my phone (which had the email indicating free parking) to which Jill replied at a much louder voice than was required (since I was right in front of her) yeah, but it wont do you any good, Priceline People never ever get free parking. And then something to the effect of Id like to see this email. As I walked away to get my phone and my wife waited nearby, Jill continued to rant about the situation right in front of my wife as if she wasnt standing there. This was getting very embarrassing for the both of us as there were lots of customers around because the morning breakfast was just wrapping up. I returned with my iPhone, showed the email, free parking was granted, although not without a few extra snarky comments from Jill. No apology, no thanks for being patient, no sorry for the confusion, nothing. Also, worth noting that we were put into a room without a balcony, not sure if that was further punishment for using Priceline. It clearly indicates online that all rooms have a private balcony. If your hotel wants to treat Priceline guest different than other guests, you should probably not make your hotel available to be booked through Priceline.Dear sir,I am very sorry that your experience at the Residence Inn Seattle Lake Union was not to your expectations. I have contacted Priceline to ensure that our information is correct for future travelers. Though it doesn't appear that you were treated this way, I'd like to assure you that guests who book through Priceline can expect the same level of guest service that we pride ourselves on providing to all of our guests. I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you directly about your experience and anything I can do to make it right for you. You can contact me at (206) 624-6000.Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback so that we can continue to improve in the future.Carl AntonGeneral ManagerResidence Inn by Marriott - Seattle Lake Union",Neutral
"I was in town for training, I booked the room here because of the location and the other hotels in my price range where booked. My room was clean and roomy, but the property is a bit rundown. I had an issue with my door lock being tough to open. I told the front desk about it, but it was never resolved. Their breakfast is a bit sparse and cheap. I mean you can see through the strips of bacon, the eggs where rubbery and the sausage was chewy as well. I asked about oatmeal that I usually have and was told that no they didn't have. If you get a room on the second floor ask for the number before you go up. 216 to 224 are over the indoor pool. They can get noisy if there are any children staying there. I wasn't aware about the homeless population in the area, but I did get an uncomfortable feeling about the area. While nothing happened during my stay, i would keep it in mind. There where a lot of things that just didn't work, ice machine on my floor wasn't working, the thermostat in my room just didn't work right, the waffle machine, several lights in the hallway, and several window screens where out or hanging from the windows. Over all it is Rough Around the Edges.On behalf of our Management team thank you for taking the time for post your feedback on Trip Advisor.

"The Inn at Virginia Mason is attached to Virginia Mason hospital. Some floors of the hotel are hospital offices (anesthesiology is on floor 2, for example). You'll see people in scrubs on the stairs and elevators.The rooms are old, in a part charming, and part just old way. The closets were huge, a nice bonus. The bathtub had some chips, and some plastic on the toilet seat was peeling away. There's no AC which normally isn't a problem it was hot when I was there and the hotel gave me a fan, which was adequate. The staff was super helpful in general.There is a nice little breakfast place in the hotel, the Rhody, which was not overpriced and was quick. The location is great, 10 blocks to the Sound and about 2 blocks to the Convention Center.I was on a business trip and was paying my own way, so the price (about half of the chain hotels) was right and I'd stay again. If someone else were paying, I'd stay elsewhere, but the location and value were terrific for me. I would not recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend or a family vacation.Thank you for your review! We're glad you found us suitable for your business trip.

"This is an old Radisson Hotel that was bought out by an investment group. They have replaced all of the fixtures and flooring and refurbished the lobby. What has been completed thus far is fabulous. The first floor contains tables, a courtyard, restrooms and a sports room, all of which have been done with a contemporary, artistic flair second to none. The downside of the hotel is that the room is size of a postage stamp. We could barely move around the beds. One, slow elevator was working during the time we were there. The others were broke. For safety reasons (I presume), hotels have decided that you can no longer take the stairs...if you go into the stairwell, you are only allowed to exit out the bottom floor onto the street. No self laundry facilities offered. I would suggest staying at the Courtyard, two blocks away and visiting the lobby of the Zephyr. You will have more room for less money.Greetings Esquiresmith,Thank you for sharing your thoughts about Hotel Zephyr, yes we have renovated and rebranded and are almost one year old. It is a long process of change and our elevators are all undergoing a modernization upgarde we have six of them so this does take time. We are very close to being finished and apologize for that inconvenience during your stay. One of the phases of renovation takes place later this year and is an upgrade to a modern key system. When we complete the key system upgrade, those older doors in the stairwells will have locks on them that will be openable with your guest room key. I hope that as we continue to grow and upgrade the hotel, you might consider staying with us again. May your travel experiences always be unique,Jason WilliamsGeneral Manager",Neutral

"The hotel decor is a bit dated and the rooms slightly neglected. The bathroom wasn't great we did complain about our shower and the did quickly send a housekeeper to take a look at it. The rooms were a moderate size. There is a bit of noise from the streets below however it is a city destination. What I wish we knew beforehand is that it is opposite a night shelter for the homeless therefore there were. Few people on the street corner talking/signing and praying to themselves. Was slightly intimidating walking pass in the evenings. The valet took 20 /30 mins to collect the car when requested during the stay- though the staff were helpful. Rooms don't have a coffee machine either. The lighting in the rooms was dim - little impractical and the plug sockets a bit suspect. Dear SGee2013, We're sorry to hear you had this impression.

"My wife and I stayed here while visiting the Del Mar Fairgrounds. My wife liked it a lot, but I had some hesitations. The room did not have a mini-refrigerator which I thought all Hampton Inns had. If you are expecting a mini-frig, be sure and request it when making your reservations. The furniture and room colors were drab and boring, and could use upgrading or wall paper. The beds were very good. The flat screen t.v. was nice, but no HD channels, and in fact, only about a dozen channels. Could use Discovery and Fox Sports San Diego. The breakfast room downstairs is very big with a good breakfast, (although I would have liked some donuts or something sweet!). I thought the towels were very thin, and could use upgrading. There were no flyers/brochures of local attractions like all hotels have now days. I thought the Hampton Inn-Kearney Mesa was better. But, this hotel was VERY QUIET, considering all the people staying there during the fair! That was a major plus.",Neutral
"Could be a great hotel but it needs to be modernized. The exterior is attractive and fits the location (Old Town) however the rooms are run-down dark and noisy. The internet kept dropping us and it was very slow. Breakfast buffet was meager, and the same items daily. Our rate included a free drink, ONE free breakfast per couple, one appetizer. The parking situation is weak. The garage is so tight that many guests took two spots. That is unacceptable someone should enforce that.Thank you for complimenting the attractiveness of our grounds and superior location. The style of the hotel is designed to fit into the vintage California charm of Old Town. Before your next stay, please reach out to either Dean Feather stone (our Asst. Front Office Manager) or myself so we can be sure to personalize your room assignment. I am confident we can find something that suits your preferences, in a quieter location here.

I anticipated this resort having interior corridors like the pictures led me to believe however it did not. The rooms were very old and definitely could use some updating and refurbishing.

"Very unique room configuration especially if you are a family. Doors open to the outside which all face inward to the open courtyard. First section or the room is your main bed, tv, mini fridge and microwave, then the second section separated by a siding interior door is a bunk bed, chest and tv then the back section of the room is the full bath. The bath area looks like it was updated at some time and is nice, staff has plenty of soap, shampoo, coffee and towels stocked. Staff was in the process of replacing all mattresses in the main beds of all rooms while I was there, in fact mine was being replaced as I checked in. Parking can be tough if the hotel is full especially if you drive a big car or truck. Exterior is in need of maintenance. Breakfast was plentiful and the normal Comfort Suites breakfast.

"We picked this hotel based on the reviews, rate including parking, and location to fishermans wharf. Overall, I am happy enough with the value, but next stay in San Fran I would pay more and stay in Union Square in a nicer hotel.The hotel was fine. Average hotel really with very good service. It is a motor inn, and is well described as such. The location is great to fishermans wharf, Chinatown and bus routes. It is a very walkable locations and we took advantage of this. Rooms was. A very good size. We paid extra for a sleeper sofa so that our kids could sleep separate. It was nothing of the sort however and was just an old sofa. That said, the room was large and well suited our needs.One other note, it can be a little noisy being on a busy street in a busy are. One night of our two was quite loud, the other was very quiet.

"Love this place whenever we are in the Napa Valley. Great location, near shops and places to eat, and most importantly it is affordable :-) We spend most of our time visiting wineries and restaurants, so we only need somewhere to recover and sleep :-) Bonus is that the beds are comfortable and have lots of pillows. There also is a small fridge to keep food and drinks cold and a microwave to reheat leftovers!Our only complaint is that the spa and pool close at 9pm. We would have liked to soak in the hot tub and we were turned away. It's a little early this time of year (can understand the policy in the winter) when visitors are still arriving after a day out.All in all, it was a good visit here.",Neutral

"The Freehand has a nice appearance and is clean is well-situated for getting around the city. The guest kitchen is great for people who want to save money by bringing their own food. That's where the positives end.First, I had a room on the second floor, and the loud music from the lounge downstairs went on well into the wee hours of the morning. I couldn't get a wink of sleep!Next, it turns out it's impossible to turn on the air conditioning if the hotel's air is set to heat. The most you can do if you're uncomfortably warm is turn off the air and open your bedroom window. Except...Third: The windows don't have screens! But they're still able to be open.

The rooms are a little dated,,,but were clean. Front desk folks were very good and treated us nice. Gave us a room overlooking the lake. Funny thing,,,I wanted to comment on the bed being too soft,,so on the day we departed, I noticed a new mattress ready to be installed in our room sitting outside the door!!! Breakfast was adequate to good. I do not know, but hotels with free breakfast just don't cook good scrambled eggs!! :( Good coffee though, after all, this is Seattle!!Overall,,this Marriott hotel needs some renovation,,,but pretty good place to stay,,,I would stay again.",Neutral

Considering the price range, I was quite happy with the hotel and wouldn't mind staying there again.",Neutral

"We have found this place thanks to Tripadvisor - it didn't pop out on Booking or anywhere else. We used their own website to book the room. What I was looking for was a place near Fisherman Wharf with easily accessible parking. This place went one step ahead and offered free parking and a room with reasonable price.The location is excellent - within walking distance from the wharf, at rather quiet (for S.F. standards) street . If the location is what you care about - I can definitely recommend this hotel. What surprised me (in a good way) was the free WiFi connection which was very fast and reliable, which is not always a case in American hotels. A coffee maker was a nice addition to the room and super cold drinks from the hotel vending machine saved our lives on a very tough morning )OK, now the dark side of the hotel... First of all, it wasn't the place you want to spend a romantic weekend at - it was not perfecly clean, there was this strange smell in the hallway and in the room which gives you a message it's high time to change carpets and mattresses all over the place. But you can get used to it after a day or two )I've mentioned the parking - yes, it was free (yay!) and easy to find. And yes, you could always take your car out without waiting for the valet. But the whole area and parking places themselves were very small and it took me some time to park the car and then get out of it. If you're driving a rental and you don't know and 'feel' the car - it can get a little bit tricky. Last thing was the front desk service... I know it's not the Ritz but - come on, guys! - calling a cab for your guests shouldn't be a problem, right Well, it is at Columbus.",Neutral
"I stayed for over a week. You get what you pay for, but it was fine where I stayed (5th Floor). For 56/night (taxes incl), close to everything, and away from the seedier parts of downtown, it's a pretty good deal.They don't change the sheets every day, but do you change your bed sheets every day at home I believe they change every 3 or 4 days, but you have to ask them.I didn't see any bed bugs. But I took precautions, just in case. I kept things off the floor, and I put a big clear plastic garbage bag around my suitcase. And I brought double-sided tape to use as bug trap if I needed it (which I didn't).The breakfast, if you chose to buy the breakfast tickets for 4, consisted of toast, bagels, milk, juice, boiled eggs, and a chocolate snack (all bought from Costco).There is WiFi, but you have to go into this big room on the second floor to get it - no big deal.If you need some deals or ideas of what to do, in the lobby, you will see a rack full of brochures. Some of those brochures have coupons in it for restaurants or ideas on what to do in SF.Yes, you don't get the quality of service in a 4 or 5 star hotel, but you get what you pay for. It's either a one-star (if you take the shared bathroom) versus the two-star (private bathroom) facility.I would recommend this place to people who aren't fussy and who don't have high expectations.",Neutral
"I chose this hotel because it was close to the venue where I went to a concert, and I thought a Best Western would be nice. It was not worth the price I paid. Besides not providing breakfast or a discount coupon for breakfast at the adjoining restaurant, the room was small, the towels felt like sandpaper, and the list of television stations was incomplete.",Neutral
"Mandatory 20 a night charge for 'Services', charged to all visitors regardless of whether they're used. Poor wifi quality so unable to use which may have helped me reconcile to the mandatory charge but actually made me more resentful to it.

We do have this listed on all booking sites and our own website to help communicate this upfront before making your reservation. I apologize if you had trouble with the WiFi, I will certainly have my team look into this right away.

"Having flown in from Australia en route to Quebec I had a stop over in Philadelphia. Looking forward to a nice quiet room and a break from the 20+ hours of travel it took to get to Philadelphia I checked in at the Fairfield. The free shuttle arrived as promised and the driver was friendly. Reception was pleasant but distant , the room was clean. I had forgotten to pack a power adapter and upon checking with reception and eventually translating the word adapter into a version of the word the receptionist could understand I was told they didn't have them only power point to USB adapters . Which was great for my phone. It was annoying to not be able to get an adapter from reception but even more annoying was the nonchalant attitude of the staff. Not in any way rude just uncaring . The free breakfast was welcome and filling . All in all the place was nothing more and nothing less than a 3 star hotel .

Then we changed the third time - this time we received a comfortable suit. Overall, the hotel is old a far from meeting standards of current architecture and design.

"I stayed at this hotel for two weeks last summer. The hotel itself is nothing special, but it was fine for what I was paying. In honesty, I would pay more to have a better hotel, but I dont regret staying there.The room was clean, it was spacious, but basic. The only complaints I had were that the air con was quite noisy and leaked a bit, and after nobody turned up to fix it, I just switched it off completely. Another complaint was the safe. When I arrived, there was no door on it at all, but after one call, they came and fixed it.Another was just the position of the room. I was on the first floor, and at the main entrance to the rooms in the hotel, so EVERYONE walked past my room constantly, and they weren't quiet, and especially at night, this did bother me a little, but that was minor, and not the hotels fault.In future, I would rather pay a little bit more for a nicer hotel, but if I couldnt afford to, I'd be quiet happy staying here. It's in a GREAT location, and I felt safe enough to walk around at night on my own.",Neutral
Strong mildew/mold smell in bathroom keeps me from giving this place a better rating. The public areas and fitness room very nice and clean. And it's easy on/off the highway for a convenient overnight stop. Typical Hampton breakfast.,Neutral
We stayed in a corner suite. I liked the setup of the suite which had a separate work area from the sleeping area. The bathroom was a good size as well. I also thought the cleaning staff did a decent job.What I didn't like: 1) the bathroom has some mildew issues in the shower that needs to be addressed and the tile grout throughout the bathroom needs to be cleaned/bleached as it is showing its wear and lack of cleaning. 2) on the last night of our stay I guess we finally got a next door neighbor and when I tell you the noise from them taking a shower was soooooooo loud... it was borderline unacceptable and really pissed me off. I had to turn the tv up to hear what I was watching. If we had heard that the 1st 2 nights of our stay I would have definitely complained but given it was our last night I left it alone but decided to post this review. 3) view of city was not that great. Our view was mainly of the top of some building and you could see a small part of the water Overall the hotel was ok but what really annoyed me was how loud our neighbors shower was while we were trying to turn in for the night. I don't know that I've ever stayed at a hotel where I could hear my neighbors shower that clearly (and I've stayed at a lot of hotels). This is Completely unacceptable!!!!!,Neutral

Free continental breakfast and toast/waffles that you can make for yourself.There are a few restaurants within walking distance or if you wish to walk a little longer (about 20 minutes) there are many restaurants in the Pt.

Microwave oven, hair dyer, iron, refrigerators are in the rooms.I'd stay there again but it is by no means a fancy place to stay.Oh yes, there is some road noise as it is located on Harbor Drive.

"I am giving this hotel three stars not because it is an exceptionally nice hotel but the price we paid was amazing. The rooms are large and clean , although not particularly pretty. The breakfast is pretty poor but for the price what can you expect It's not the type of breakfast that you can have to aim to fill up for the day: coffee, juice (not real), cereal, toast, but it'll do. The location is excellent, especially if you are not hiring a car. The staff were nice, although we didn't come in contact with them a lot as it is very much just a place to lay your head - not the type of hotel you want to spend a lot of time chilling out in. In our first room the safe was broken - I felt we needed one and they moved us staright away no problems. All in all in far exceeds expectations for the price.",Neutral

In researching for our latest Disneyland trip the recurring negative about the Del Sol was parking. I agree it is tight and not enough spaces for rooms but we had no problem finding a space. They do offer valet at no extra charge. The Room: Like advertised the kids suite/room had 12 queen beds and a bunk bed which was perfect for us. The room looked nice but felt dingy. Overall it was spacious enough for the 5 of us which was great. The bathroom is small and the floor was sagging a bit by the tub. I told them and hopefully it will get repaired. The beds really weren't comfortable and the sheets were stiff. They could use new mattresses and sheets and that'll take care of that issue. Sound travels a ton there. They had a quiet time rule in effect at 10pm which is nice but when a small child in the next room is acting up you can hear everything as if it was right there. The property is hidden behind Dennys and is a seriously short walk to Disneyland. You can't beat the location at all. It's a small hotel with a small pool which we didn't use. They offer breakfast that we didn't partake in but it looked like a lot of people did. The service was good. Everyone was helpful and friendly. Just a couple of small fixes and we would be back.,Neutral

Front desk and bistro dining staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is very cramped in limited space but this is San Francisco so that was to be expected. I arrived prior to the official check in time and was allowed to check in early but the only available room was on a lower floor. I usually prefer an upper floor but the advantage of checking in early over weighted my room preference. Since I was only 1 level above the lobby I could hear lots of street noise and there was scaffolding outside my window due to some exterior renovation. My room was actually a nice size for a major city. It certainly met my needs. Again the front desk and bistro dining staff were exceptional.,Neutral

"I've stayed at other Fairfield Inns and my overall experience has been good. If you're looking for a very basic, nice hotel, this is a good one. But, there are a few caveats. The room was cold, and the bedding is extremely minimal - just a sheet and a very light cover. Upon requesting a couple of extra blankets, I was told that they weren't sure they had any. Luckily, a nice gentleman showed up at the door with blankets a few minutes later. Although the sign in the bathroom says that if you hang up your towels you can help the hotel to be green by not washing and replacing them every day, this wasn't the case. Each and every day, there were new towels. Also, the toiletries were never replenished, so I had to request more. On the last night of my stay, I discovered a silverfish and an ant on the bathroom floor. This might suggest that the hotel do a little more cleaning to prevent this type of incident in the future.I used the hotel's shuttle to go to the airport Marriott location for dinner one night. This was a very convenient option, and the driver was very nice and accommodating.The breakfast was great (breakfast sandwiches, waffles, fruit, oatmeal, etc,) and service was extremely friendly!Hello,Thank you very much for taking the time to provide your feedback.

"Nice, old renovated hotel. Room a little small, very hard to move around the room with only the 2 of us. Pretty cheap for San Francisco though. Wifi very bad, couldn't get a decent connection, kept dropping out. Parking in San Francisco is very bad, so be prepared. Hotel does offer valet parking though, a bit on the expensive side. Old style elevator so a bit hard to operate if your hands are full of luggage. Staff very friendly. Our room key kept not working. Other than that, it was an average stay. Good for the price if you want a place to crash for the night. If you have a lot of luggage, you will need a bigger room, as the king side bed, tv cabinet, bar fridge take up all the room.",Neutral
"I thought the location of the hotel was excellent. The service was good especially the valets. However, we saw some very large cockroaches which we did not expect to see, when we brought it up to the front desk, he said, oh yes, because we are located next to restaurants. I have stayed in Many hotels next to many restaurants and have never seen this before. Rather disappointing. Hello, I hope you had an amazing 60th birthday and thank you for celebrating your special day in SF and our hotel. I appreciate the compliments about our valet team, they truly go out of their way to ensure our guests are taken care of.In regards to the cockroaches, we have already called our vendor to inspect all areas of the hotel. We have routine pest control, there may be other nearby establishments that may not. Regardless, we are going to ensure that this is a focus so no other guests experience what you did. I appreciate you letting us know.I do apologize that this made your stay less than what you have expected.If you do come back to SF, please don't hesitate to email me directly at syangjdvhotels.com.Best,Suzie Yang",Neutral

"We had two rooms booked for a post cruise stay at this hotel. We checked in for 2 nights on July 22. When we entered the hotel lobby there were a ton of people either waiting for rooms or trying to check in. It seemed there was no organization at all.I am an SPG member and booked one king room on points and booked a 2 bedroom suite at full rate. At the desk, I was not greeted as an SPG member. I was told our rooms would not be available until 3pm. It was about 10am. I complained a bit and was told the hotel was fully booked the night before and there is nothing available. My group and I decided to book a tour of Seattle to pass the next few hours.We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and found only one room available. Needless to say, this did not sit well with my group. We were all very tired and just wanted to get to our room to relax. About 45 minutes later, a room was found for us and we were told to head up...except and the other desk attendant said No, that room is set for another person. The woman helping us said that the room in question should not have been given to another party. Now we are mad. Finally the woman helping me found yet another room. I told my party our initial room was given away and that second desk attendant chimed in with no it wasn't. Those other people have been waiting since 7 am! Once we finally received the room key we grabbed our luggage and tried to get on the elevator. What a mess that was! There was a group of folks with a luggage cart filled to the brim trying to maneuver it onto the elevator. It was too heavy for the elevator so they were stuck half in and half out blocking up the hallway! Finally we got through and went up to our room.Our room was the 2 bedroom king suite. It was a nice room. Unfortunately there was a big iron mark in the rug but it was clean. There are no phones in the bedrooms. Only one phone on the desk in the living room. The room was spacious and comfortable. There is only one bathroom. It has 2 doors, one opens to the main living area and the other opens to a bedroom. One problem in the bedroom was the door stop for the bathroom door is right by the bed where you step when getting out of bed! That is a design flaw that really should be corrected! The bath was large and clean.As usual in the Sheraton chain, the bedding is fantastic! Overall, the room was great for what we needed. It slept the three of us comfortably. The location is good to the Space Needle. The area is a bit rundown but there are some places to eat, which we did not do. I would stay here again if they work out the delays in check in. In the meantime, if you are staying here, I suggest you request a guaranteed early check in time to avoid the hassles we endured. I did explain all of these concerns on my SPG emailed survey and was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the hotel manager via email. He apologized for the circumstances and said the hotel is working on the influx of cruise passengers and trying to figure out its policies for check in times. His prompt response was unexpected and completely appreciated! I was also issued some SPG points as compensation. Because of his attention I do not hesitate to recommend this property. It is a fair price in a good location with fantastic beds!",Neutral
"We stayed here because my husband had a meeting that was being held at this hotel. I had great expectations based on reviews I read on trip advisor and the beautiful pictures on the website. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. It is a fine hotel. As I said in the title it's serviceable. Maybe my standards are too high but I felt there were certain things lacking that you would expect at a top notch hotel. We checked in late at night and the place was deserted. We waited at the front desk for a few minutes and then ran into someone sweeping the floor who then went to find someone to check us in. It was odd. We finally got to our room and I say finally because the hotel is laid out in such a way as to be somewhat confusing until you figure out what's going on. So it took us awhile to get to the room. We were on the 3rd floor but there was no elevator so we had to make several trips to get to the room with our luggage. I would hope that there is an easier way if you are incapable of stairs and luggage but it wasn't readily accessible to us. The hallways look dated and we commented on how outside almost every room were champagne glasses. I assume people were done with them and put them outside the rooms for pickup but why they were there at midnight was beyond me and I'm talking the majority of rooms. We had to make sure not to knock into them with our luggage and shatter glasses. This was a daily occurrence. We certainly didn't get champagne so not sure what that was about. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were clean. However, the pillowcases were too short for the pillows so they hang out (quirk of mine but I hate that in a hotel). I like the pillow to be completely covered. The towels were incredibly soft but very small. Again, another quirk but I think in a nice hotel there should be large towels and more than just two per day. There was one bar of soap to wash hands with and we like to have one for the shower instead of the bath gel. So asked two days in a row to please have an extra bar of soap. By day three we actually received them. The grounds are beautiful with lots of places to sit, but none of the sitting areas were actually comfortable. Some comfortable sitting areas would be welcome. Lastly, we had easter brunch at the Mustang and burros restaurant as we were meeting family from LA. They drove down for this 70 per person brunch. The brunch was fine but in no way merited 70 per person. Had a hard time getting refills on coffee. Never got offered any other drinks, asked for bowls but never came. Just kind of disorganized and the seating outside is awkward because the tables are low and the chairs are high and you are sort of hunched over. I hate that this sounds like a complaining review because I usually don't like to do that but I just felt annoyed that I flew to San Diego which is a 4 hour flight for me, to keep my husband company at his meeting and in hopes of having a relaxing stay at a beautiful hotel and just felt it was not worth the time and money it took to get there.Dear Vicki000,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia while your husband was at our resort on business.

"I stayed here for one night, as planned, on my way back home from another trip. The staff throughout was amazing. The hotel is located in a old building but then again it is at the tip of the french quarter so that should be expected. The room I stayed in was really large with a comfortable king bed, eating table, office desk and chair, credenza and couch. It was outdated in its style but for the price and location, and short stays, this is a really great deal. The bathroom needs to be bleached down but there were more than enough clean towels and counter space with a small coffee maker for the supplied coffee and tea. They also have complimentary continental breakfast. It was too cold to use the terrace but it would be the perfect place for morning coffee and beignets. The location results in a quieter sleep but verify your surroundings before venturing.",Neutral
"I'm a platinum member and used points to stay here on new years eve with my husband.I checked in earlier in the day via the mobile app so my keys were ready when i arrived - which was nice. Problem was that the front desk attendant literally just handed me the keys and said have a nice stay. no explanation of the amenities, no mention of restaurants or any festivities for the new year. Didn't ask if i had parked onsite. Didn't offer instruction to elevator or where my room was located - it was VERY odd. not a great way to start our stay. After we walked away - both my husband and I were taken aback by how unfriendly the woman was and that we had no idea where to go to find our room.We did find our room - and it was nice. nothing amazing or crazy - but nice. We had a room with view of the braves stadium - which worked out well because they had fireworks that night for NYE.With the hotel being a Renaissance - I just expected more. maybe if you had an event or convention at the hotel - it would be nicer to be there. But for a night away with your spouse - it was completely lackluster. There are so many hotels in ATL - we will definitely be trying out somewhere else next time we visit.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

"We come to New Orleans multiple times a year. We normally stay at another chain of hotels but our normal arrangements were booked full. This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate.",Neutral
"It was difficult to get to. Desk clerk at check in wasn't pleasant seemed like she didn't want to be there.

Holes in bathmat, stains on towels, didn't service our room well, bed was not made the first morning, never stocked cups or paper products the whole time. The breakfast was edible but pretty bland, decided to eat out for breakfast after the first morning, but the Saturday breakfast guy was very friendly. Very few tv channels that was disappointing.

"We stayed in room 406 on Friday night, 11/10/17. I could tell they were doing renovations on the rooms for that floor, and was initially worried about the smell of paint that I noticed on the way to our room. However, as we got closer to the room the smell dissipated and it didn't seem at the time that it was going to be an issue. The room we had was clean, and accommodations were in good shape all around. The night auditor did a great job getting us checked in and setup. Got up early Saturday morning, went to Ikea and then lunch. Returned to the hotel around 2:30PM, and they were painting about 4 of the rooms on our floor. The hallway was filled with a mist of paint from the sprayers, and the smell was awful. I've renovated houses before and I'm no stranger to paint fumes, but I can honestly say that after about 15 minutes in the room I was having a headache and my pregnant wife absolutely did not want to spend another minute in the room. So, I went downstairs to request another room. Leonard was our customer rep, and informed us that the hotel was in fact overbooked, and there were no other rooms we could move to. Ultimately, we decided to check out and go to the La Quinta down the street. Now, this could have turned into a disaster, but Leonard did a great job of turning this around. They did not charge us for the remainder of our stay, and actually gave us a 50 discount on the one night that we did spend in the hotel. He never argued once, was sincere the entire time, and was apologetic about the inconvenience. This is the only reason we will come back to the hotel - someone actually cared about what was going on and they did right and tried to fix it. There's never a great time to renovate a hotel, but a genuine customer advocate is always a welcome change!I apologize for the experience you had during your stay, this is never the impression we like to leave with our guest.

"Stayed in this hotel for one night while visiting new orleans to scope out a wedding venue. The pros: This hotel is in an awesome location!! We walked to everywhere and didn't have to drive anywhere. The hotel staff was friendly. Free breakfast of orange juice and a croissant delivered to your room. The room was clean, nice, and had everything we needed. The cons: the door had a big space between the frame and the door that you could see between. Found a roach in the bathroom the morning we were leaving. The biggest problem would be the shower! The way you switch it from where the water comes out the faucet for a bath to coming out the shower head for a shower is by pulling up on a lever, well the lever would NOT stay up. When my fiance tried to shower before we left, he had to hold the lever up while rinsing his hair out and washing his face which is highly annoying. Other than that everything else was fine. Dear Courtney W,Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are pleased that you liked our location, friendly staff, breakfast and clean room.

"I've stayed here before and overall, they are a great hotel. The shuttle bus came right away, front desk personnel are friendly, and the place is clean and new. However, there was a glitch this time - I called for a 6:30 wake up call and it did not happen. I woke on my own at 6:45 and luckily was not under any time constraints. This could have been a dire situation. I reported this to the front desk and they said they would look into it but I guess they never did because they never got back to me and they never apologized. Also, I do not like the bedcoverings. The duvets are too warm unless you turn the a/c down to a freezing temperature. I kept waking up uncomfortable because I was either too warm (with duvet on) or too cold (with duvet off). Definitely not energy-efficient. The hotel should go back to sheets and a few light blankets.Dear guest Cindy T:I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience and disappointment on your last stay. Please accept my apologies the inconvenience that you encountered.We are constantly monitoring the performance of our team member to make sure our valuable guests as yourself is welcome with an efficient and pleasant front desk procedure that provides the accommodations and service you expect. We want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. I am sorry if this was not your experience. I cannot agree more with you in the matter that it was poorly handle by our associate and I can assure you that this incident will be address to all associates to avoid this for happening again.Hilton Garden Inn is always innovating, testing and looking for ways to ensure that our guest enjoy in every possible way their stay in any of our hotels with a clear consistency. Unfortunately, due to brand standards regulations the current duvets are part of the brand signature. However, if you let us know next time you are here about your preference for a blanket, we can add this to your profile so we can have it ready in your room on your next visit.Once again, please accept my most sincere apologies and I cannot thank you enough for expressing your concerns I hope that you can give us the chance and contact me directly to proof to you how serious we take this issues and how important you are for us.

"Don't be fooled by the name in believing this is an extradordinary hotel with diva personality. While it is clean, comfortable for the price and in a generally central location downtown making it a good location, Hotel Diva did not deliver. The lobby is fine, hot tea or sake sitting out for guests, good reception service and an inviting blue lit elevator. Then the room reality sets in. We had a double room with two separate sleeping areas. However, there was no seating area for the 2 of us to sit and visit without sitting on each other's beds. The first room was comfortable and the soft throw a nice touch, however the second room with the murphy bed was pretty tight. You couldn't have the door open to the closet and stand at the bathroom sink, or walk around the bed easily to sit on the metal chairs placed at the side. It was pretty bare bones and not the decadent diva personality we anticipated. Where was the hot pink decor or over the top opulence The grey paint had many black marks and grey can be depressing if not in prime condition. The steel decor elements helped but did not convey the sleek and sophisticated feel of a plush hotel room. Sadly disappointing. And while the condom placed in the safe indicating safe sex was cute, we almost missed it as the safe was in the dark closet and impossible to view. Who can see in the dark! While the price point for a hotel near Union Square drew us in we unfortunately won't book again as it failed to live up to the hotel name. As an event planner I believe it's about the details and so much more could have been done to make this hotel truly stand out. Thanks to the staff for their personable service but otherwise the personality was missing.",Neutral

"The hotel has a central location and we stayed here in October 2011 (room 301), therefore we booked again this year. Some upgrades are required such as the Wifi which was very slow or did not work at all(room 601). The beds are very comfortable, but the technical standard is not in accordance with the high room rate. Shower system should be changed in order to save high water consumption (general water restrictions in California).Nice staff Vidar A.

"Like everyone else says, this is a hotel for those on a budget. The pictures of the hotel are a bit misleading, including those showing the insides and pool etc. However, once you navigate your way around what is essentially a block of flats, the rooms are a pleasant surprise and are actually the best part of the hotel. Making your own breakfast loses its appeal after 1 day, especially when the cereal machines werent working and the staff on duty dont really understand english too well. however, you are close to many of the 3/4.99 breakfast buffets so its not really a problem. we were dismayed to find how easily the staff coud get assess to the safes in your room after our battery ran out and they took nearly 45mins to come up to our room (after repeated warning that we were in a hurry). as i said, the room is great though and we weren't really affected by loud crowds. if you want great service and english speaking (as a first language), don't stay here but if you don't mind it for the amount of time you'll be in room, it'l do just fine. free wifi as well. just remembered....the day we checked out and left our luggage in the 'secure' area, we got the feeling that it wasn't so as the hotel employed no way of identifying your bag so anyone could have lifted ours but thankfully we had locks.",Neutral
"This is a really beautiful property. Great location and many hardworking staff members. The issues are not with the 'rank and file' but with some higher up the food chain. As Hilton Honors members with experience of this chain throughout the Eastern Seaboard, I cannot give highest marks. This is the second Florida property which has provided plastic utensils and foam plates unworthy of guests and the vaunted Hilton green promise. Maybe it is owned by the same franchise consortium which provided the same tepid and unhealthy dinners to us last year. The second which had a surly dining 'overseer' around whom staff worked circles. She actually crowed that she never eats off stainless flatware because only plastic is clean. She continued to spout to the next guest after I opted not to engage her. The worker bees were really working hard and efficiently, but queen bee of dining needs to buzz off.",Neutral
"My husband and I stayed here overnight because we had a morning flight and the hotel was very close to the airport in an area with many other well known hotel brands. I had reserved online and from the pictures it looked like a nice hotel, not luxurious but certainly more than acceptable. As soon as we drove up we saw that the lobby area was sealed off and that the registration area was moved into the dining room. We walked in and the staff was very friendly but they had done nothing to make their new registration area appealing. It was set up on a long work table that was very cluttered. We got our room and when we parked around the back and walked in the main floor was very seedy looking. The carpet was worn out and everything looked used and dingy. Once we got to our room though on the second floor it looked as if the carpet on that floor had been replaced. The furnishings in the room and the linens looked very nice and there was an updated coffee maker and a big desk area. The bathroom though looked old and the fixtures definitely needed an update. There were so many other hotels in that location to choose from so I would not plan on staying there again.Dear guest neisie13:I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.We want our guests to have the best experience possible where everything is in place, of the highest quality, and in perfect working order.

"I made my reservations in June for an August stay and asked for a first floor room. Two weeks before arriving I called to confirm reservation and asked for a first floor room. Called the day of arrival again asking for a first floor room. When I arrived late, I was given a third floor room. This hotel has no elevator, so beware if you check in late you get the third floor. First come, first served. Being a Choice Rewards member also gets you nowhere for that first floor room.

"This property appears to be fairly new. The common areas and rooms are very well appointed and extremely clean. This is one of the best looking Hampton Inn properties I have experienced in a very long time. There were some issues that were severe enough to only give this property a 3/5 star rating. The rooms were not built well enough to block sounds from the corridors and adjoining rooms. I was constantly hearing people open and close doors and have conversations in the corridors late into the evening. I reported this the first evening but it never was resolved. Additionally, the housekeeping staff would congregate in the hallways and play loud music while cleaning rooms. This music was easily heard down the halls. This is extremely unprofessional. I also inquired upon arrival (3pm) about purchasing tickets to local attractions on-site. I was told I had to visit the Expedia travel desk at the hotel next door, but it was already closed. The clerk went on to tell me I should just go and buy them directly from the park. Again, very unprofessional. These issues will probably prevent me from staying at this property again.",Neutral
"Just an overnight before catching our flight home the next day. Our executive king room was really quite nice and was exactly the way it had been pictured on the web. The bathroom reminded me of the ones I experienced in Japan: extremely teeny. The sink was outside of the bathroom and in the bedroom. The oddest part of the room was that the 2 large windows looked right into other bedrooms in the hotel! Unfortunately, the hotel is a mess as it undergoes major renovations and expansion. Only 1 of its 2 elevators was working and the hallways were all covered in plastic due to the construction. We were fortunate to be staying on a weekend when no construction work was happening. The lobby is a joke. It was smaller than our bedroom and totally insufficient for the amount of people who were down there either checking in, checking out or just sitting/standing around! We could barely move down there. Checking out was a zoo with only 1 clerk behind the desk. The process was extremely slow, expecially when an international traveler was trying to check in early and had a lot of questions. In the meantime, I am counting the minutes that are passing as I needed to get in a cab to get to the airport! Finally, the clerk offered that if an email receipt was sufficient, that he could just take our keys and send the receipt. I would seriously think again about staying here for all the reasons noted.Thank you for sharing your stay with us.

"This is a frustrating hotel it's OK, but with minimal effort it could be so much better.The basic amenities are fine the room was clean the wifi and TV worked, and the bar was open. All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write. I wonder if management knows just how hard it's employees work to keep the customers happy",Neutral
"The location was perfect, close to Sea World since that was where we were headed. Lots of restaurants on University avenue just a mile from the hotel. Parking was convenient and free.We booked the suites since we were 5 of us. The beds were comfortable ( though I found them a little soft ). Still had a good nights rest. The bedrooms and the living room had a partition. Chairs table and a work station were in the living room. Our room overlooked the jacuzzi.The faucet in the bathroom definitely need work. It was tricky to figure out warm and cold since they worked in oopposite directions. Once we got it it was easy. I found the bathroom tiles like those found in a garden. had to use my slippers as they really hurt once out from the bath tub. We asked for the sheets not be changed. Liked their way of saving the environment. Requested for the towels to be changed.I wish the management had extra soaps since there were 5 people staying in the suite. We didnt have the time to go and request this.. We always carry some incase of instances where there aren't any. Breakfast was rrealy really good.. sausages, 2 types of eggs, cold and hot breakfast. There were tables and chairs inside as well as outside. Lots of place to sit. When depparting i needed some hot water. Couldnt find any in the coffee area, so the front desk requested the breakfast room door to be opened to assist my request. Thought this was really nice. Will definitely stay here again even though we found some glitches here and there. The price for the 2 night stay was perfect.",Neutral

"1) When we arrived we were not able to pay for underground parking because they had let non-hotel guests use the parking lot. I find it totally unacceptable. We were redirected to a lot across the street. 2) The coffee in the lobby it was very weak and often unavailable - left empty. 3) The rooms were in good shape however absolutely terrible noise problems. Whether there was poor insulation through the walls or just noisey all around. We were kept up past 2am due to noise through the walls and the next level above, this happened several of the 4 nights we were there 4) A couple of the days we had to call down because our room was still not clean at 4:30pm. The worst was when we were planning to settle in for the night because we had a 6 AM check in for an operation at the hospital the next day and we had to call down to our room cleaned.At over 400 a night we should not have to have dealt with these problems. The staff was polite enough but certainly did not seem to care about the inconveniences that we had during our stay, they Were not rude but they were not apologetic about what was going on.A simple I am very sorry and we will do our best to fix this would have gone a long wayOn the positive side1) comfortable beds however horrible pillows 2) Great location with a shuttle to all the main attractions 3) absolutely excellent breakfast. It is complementary and fabulous 4) kitchenettes in rooms were very nice to have",Neutral
"We noticed online, this hotel had both a waterview and balcony roons, which is what we were looking to book. We arrived at the hotell and was disappointed to find our view from our 2nd floor room. Was nothinf more than the very tops of sailing mast, behind buildings, way off in the distance. And since the hotel is fronted by a busy 4 lane highway. The road noise on our small balcony, was so loud, you had to shout over the loud road noise, making it useless. Apon request, we move to 4th floor rm. The room's AC unit was so load, it should never been offer and was probably the reason it hadn't already been booked and leftout of service. Since there really isn't much of a view of the harbour, we gave up on a veiw rm and moved to a 3rd floor quite parking lot side room. But the rugs here had been shampoo and were soaken wet. So we moved again, to a different 3rd floor quite paking lot view room. I think we'd paid extra for the harbour view room to bega with, it's not worth it and we never were offer a refund for the different type room we stayed in. We visit San Diego ever year and won't stay here again.",Neutral

"I was initially excited it spend 4 nights at this hotel because it meant I wouldn't have to worry about dinner during the week or breakfast since it is complimentary and I was the only adult with 5 kids under the age of 14. However what a disappointment the food was! The eggs tasted like slime. The mini Mickey waffles were always undercook even with the timer. The orange juice was always too watered down. It tasted more like water with orange flavor. And there was never any bacon! No American breakfast is complete without bacon. Don't even get me started on the dinner. Yes it was so bad we had to order papa johns pizza on Wednesday night and after giving the dinner another chance on Thursday we still had to order out. The pullout bed was terrible. I felt bad that my nieces had to sleep on it. I've never been to prison but I could imagine that prison beds were better than the coil bed they were sleeping on. It was so bad one of my nieces ended up sleeping on the couch and the other on the floor with extra blankets as her cushion. The kitchen, though very small, ended up being great because I was able to go to a local grocery store and stock up on snacks and cold cuts for the kids. If you are like me and are staying here for the benefit of food, don't do it. The food is something I would never serve to my own family. And if you are planing to use the pullout bed than plan for a bad nights rest for whoever has to sleep on it. I have stood in other Homewood suites and I am a Hilton Honors member so I expected it to be better but it wasn't. However everything in the room was clean. The maid was very diligent and I liked being able to use the laundry on site. The staff was also very friendly, especially the lady that works at the check in desk at night. Simply put, if the food was better quality and better tasting like other Homewood suites than it would get more stars.",Neutral

"The hotel has promise, but this was not a pleasant stay. First, the good. The rooms are nice as well as the lobby area. The room was clean. The Elite lounge is better than average. The room was set up mostly to my request (minus a mini fridge). The things that make me not want to go back: 1) The elevator noise. I was put in an 07 all the room ending with 07 are the back wall of the elevator bank and they have some crazy loud elevators. I was waken up maybe half a dozen times before calling down to get a new room. The people on duty acted like Oh yeah, a lot of people like those rooms, it is just you I was not in the mood for the attitude at 2:40 in the am.. 2)The state of repair in the rooms. When I tried to call down about a room change, the first phone I picked up was dead.. OK, I walked to a second phone, picked it up, and it was dead (Batteries were shot). I called from the speaker phone. In the second room, I picked up the phone to make a call down to the desk, and guess what, the phone was dead. I tried to turn on the television then, guess what, it was dead. THe next day, I had tehm com up and fix the dead items, which they did. 3) Third and final for this stay, I tried to hook up my HDMI out to the tv to watch a movie, and guess what, the clever people at Marriott had disabled the ability to use your own content, If everything else had been good, this alone would have kept me from giving them a 5 rating.Thank you for your recent visit and for letting us know about your stay. While I am glad to learn you enjoyed your room and the concierge lounge, I was terribly sorry to learn that you experienced noise from the elevators, problems with the phones and TVs in your room. I will most certainly have our engineeing team investigate the rooms near the elevators and check for necessary repairs. Most concerning is the lack of concern you received when reporting your problems. You can rest assured that I will share your comments with our staff for further training and immediate attention. This is not typical for the JW Marriott Atlanta and I hope you will give us the opportunity to regain your trust and confidence by visiting us again. Thank you for letting me know.",Neutral

While I some times find corporate chains to be lacking in hospitality and supportive staff, I found the staff at Spring Hill to be very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean. Room service was prompt and the food was well prepared. I was pleasantly surprised by the grab go breakfast buffet they stocked on every floor this allowed me to grab a quick and tasty bite to eat as I was out the door for business meetings. The hotel was conveniently located to downtown - it seemed to be just close enough to walk, but far enough away as to not charge premium prices.

"We had great interaction with all staff members. The current state of construction was a little irritating. Only one elevator working, and long lines for it. Internet went our for an entire day, fire alarm went off multiple times during one day, and the outside noise was horrible! I would not recommend a street facing room. Our toilet didn't like to flush properly and the shower looked renovated but somewhat unfinished. There was a service charge per day that included internet, a bottle of water and a cosmo shot in the lobby in the evening. While this is nice, you do NOT have the option, this charge is required on top of your room rate. I did not appreciate this surprise upon arrival! Its a work in progress, hopefully this will be super cute chic soon and the additional charge will be reconsidered!Thank you for taking the time to review us. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our friendly staff members. I apologize however if you were inconvenienced by the upgrades taking place and were unhappy with the daily facility fee.

"Honestly, the size of the room was great. I had my fiance' and my two teen sons with me. My son's switched out the bedroom, because we were there two nights. While one was sleeping in the bedroom, the other slept on the couch. We had attempted to pull out the sleeper sofa, but decided against it because we found cookie crumbs and other items underneath the mattress. The couch itself didn't look that clean, so I bought new linen and he slept on it instead. There was the hassle of using the key card everywhere, but when it comes to safety, I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was also the issue of how our room was being paid, we secured the deposit with a credit card, but when we got there, we wanted to pay with cash. But everything was quickly cleared up with a phone call to the manager. Overall, our stay there was pleasant. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for taking time to share your experience with us. We consistently work to address the concerns our guests have shared.

"Arriving in the middle of the afternoon on a business trip, I chose to forego grabbing fast food at the airport, and instead took my shuttle directly to the Renaissance Waverly Hotel. Big mistake. After a quick (and delightful) check-in, I rushed up to my King-sized room and changed clothes, hoping to run back downstairs and grab a very late lunch/early dinner. No such luck. No cafe or restaurant in the hotel was open during the day except for very specific lunch hours (11a - 2p). I was out of luck until 5:30pm - more than 2 hours away. I was famished! So I went back downstairs and put my credit card on file so I could order room service with its ridiculous delivery fee and separate room service charge. I know most hotels do this, but for a convention center with travelers arriving at all hours of the day, at least have a coffee/snack shop open! So far, this has left a bad taste in my mouth (because I am still waiting for room service, it's all I've had in my mouth!)I really appreciate your feedback and agree with you that you should be able to get a bite to eat in the afternoon. When the restaurant is closed we have Tosca Blu (lounge) open and do serve a pretty extensive menu. I am very sorry we did not make that clear to you and will follow up with my team. Please call me when you are coming back to town, I would like to take special care of you the next time you are with us!",Neutral

"Overall nice Hotel, nice area. Rooms are small if your tall you may want to avoid the bathroom, the water pressure is really low and the water is kind of slimy sticks with your skin after your dry. I've stayed at other Hotels in NOLA and can't blame the water source. Parking is a bit cramped if you drive a SUV or Truck be careful. Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early. Like I said Hotel was decent would not however be my first choice more of a back up plan.Thank you for choosing our hotel for your stay here in New Orleans. We need honest reviews from guest's like you in order to correct our shortcomings. The construction should be finished in late summer or early fall of this year. This streetcar line will be a great plus for this part of the French Quarter. Our water goes through a water softener which will make it feel like it is still on you after you have rinsed. We do close our gates at 11:30 each night and have a Security Officer on premises every night with only one door unlocked to access the hotel. We sure wish we could make our parking lot bigger. We would really love for you to consider us again on any future trips to New Orleans. We would love to see you again.Robert K., Manger on Duty",Neutral
"Nice old hotel in a busy location with lots of stuff to do in the area. Parking cost 15 a night which was ok and worth it. Small rooms. Hardly any guests in December when we were there. There is a no alcohol policy at the pool/hot tub which left us not using it. The 250 total cost per night seemed excessive but for the area is probably the norm. View of the ocean was great once you get over the homeless people openly using drugs on the boardwalk. All in all it was an ok place.Thank you for sharing your previous experience with us. We aimed to provide a 5 stars experience for all of our guests and we apologize for fallen short during stay. We appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention because we are always looking for ways to improve. In regards to the homeless situation...the boardwalk is city property, so there's a limit on what we can do.

"I found this on Trip advisor to be the top rated hotel in Phoenix. Hmm, maybe need to rethink my sources It was fine. But really - another 'cool industrial hotel' with large common areas to hang with other hotel guests. Yikes. We had a large room with a balcony. Sliding walls were good but the weird blue velvet curtain that separated the bathroom from the bedroom was weird. There were 5 sinks in our room. One in the toilet room, two that overlooked the living room and two that overlooked the bedroom. Why Then there was a 'super cool' shower with clear glass that said SEXY and another shower that was frosted that said NOT SEXY. What No tub. No closet. A corner with a place to hang some clothes next to the sexy shower....and a smaller blue velvet curtain. NO! Maybe I am just too old for this place Give me a nice bathroom with a great shower, double sink and a deep tub..a coffee pot and a great bed and I am happy. Hey! Thanks for the feedback.

"This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are quite nice. The large was extremely comfortable, but there were a few issues I experienced: - The hallways smelled of dirty wet dog. - There were outlets for charging on only one side of the King bed. - I expected liquid soap in the bathroom and shower as I've had at the last two Hamptons I've stayed at. - There is a hotel being demolished on one side of the hotel, so the construction noises started fairly early. - The breakfast buffet was extremely sub-par. The paper plates and plastic utensils were just tacky and I expected more from a Hampton. The food options were lacking, the fruit was not fresh, the eggs had an odd flavor, there were no breakfast meats at all, and the self-serve coffee was empty and when I politely alerted a staff member, I was basically ignored.Dear Will L,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us.

"Me and three friends of mine stayed here for three nights, while visiting San Francisco for sightseeing. We booked the hotel thru priceline and got a rate for 160 US, which is ok for this hotel. The hotel itself is located some minutes food walk from Union Square, so the location is ok. The rooms are nice and have a good size, but are not very big. Bathroom is ok but not perfect. The lobby is nice and so is the interior. They service free wine in the late afternoon, which is nice. I had a room to the patio which is not too nice, because it is kind of dark. I looked the other rooms of my friends and they were much nicer because they were much lighter. Check in and check out was fine, room service was fine too. Before we booked the hotel, we looked up some other offers for other hotels in the internet. I dont know why, but prices were very high for that weekend in San Francisco, for that reason we thought the value for this hotel was ok. And the hotel itself was ok too. But I am not sure if I would come back to this hotel next time. Dont get me wrong, the hotel is not bad or anything, but there is just something which I didnt like even if I cant tell you what. I was not really sure if I should give 3 or 4 points to this hotel, so lets say I give 3.5 points.Overall, if you come here you dont do anything wrong, but dont expect too much.

"This is my second stay here on a family trip to Disneyland. Last time was about a year ago. Some things were the same- you can see they are very actively renovating still and I was very impressed with the customer service as before. Breakfast is minimal- coffee, juice, cereal and Costco pastry- but down the street is Varsity Burger which is great, fast, cheap eats (classic LA pastrami, mexican burgers joint) so that's okay. I think the key to a happy stay here is requesting a renovated room. They were putting new furniture in the rooms and renovating the hallway to the lobby so you can SEE major improvements in the works. However, many rooms are not yet refurbished. I stayed in a partially refurbished room last time with a kitchenette and 2Q beds. Was VERY pleased with this room for cleanliness, lay out, and price. Linens were new and crisp, bed was super comfortable, furniture needed some love but was highly functional. This time we stayed in the same building, 2Q with micro/fridge, but not the built in kitchenette area. Thought we had booked the same room, but rooms are not all the same even when in the same building, and this one was somewhat shabby- needs new carpets, burnt out light bulbs, bad plaster job on hole in wall, broken towel rack. That said, mattress was comfortable and same nice, clean linens.

"The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out.

Helpful concierge. Walking distance to the Moscone Center.

"First impression, I see vehicles parked tightly not only on the curved street immediately in front of this Four Points, but continuing as tight on the front end of this Four Points Hotel property up, with only a small passageway past their shuttle, to the hotel entrance. Never have I seen vehicles parked at this concentration at the front of any hotel before! Upon entering the Hotel, I see a very new hotel look and like what I see. I wait but a few minutes and then am assigned a room. Room 127, first floor. I checked in at about 9:30 PM Saturday night and that was what was available, but requested an upper floor room, if available, the following night. Duly noted.First room impression. Beautiful room so far. How do the lights work Not the usual toggle switch. No hint from the front desk about simple light operations, at all. Onward into the dark room until I get the lights on. No master switch. Every light has its own switch. Bathroom has three. Awesome bathroom with glass doors.First night room impression. HVAC works well. Not too loud. People walking down, and talking loudly, the hallway can be heard clearly ! People running or walking upstairs sound loudly. Slamming doors on every room are very loud inside my room. Screaming or running children are not silent! The sound of dripping water from from an upper level HVAC unit sound like tapping on my window tap most of the night long. Second night impression. Moved upstairs to Room 226. No more frequent travelers headed for upper levels. Same drip drip drip sound from an upper level HVAC unit dripping on my window frame, or HVAC frame. Only on screaming child in the hall about 7:30AM.The desk personnel were very simple and personal. They helped me move a room request. Parking impression. Ugly. Animal like. You gotta be kidding me.

The room was not the best that I've seen and definately not the worse. There were two beds, a fridge and I think a microwave, although I can't remember for sure. The beds were comfortable. The room was a bit noisy with traffic, but I was able to sleep. The bathroom was small. The whole room could use a paint job and some new furnishings.

"I am a huge Marriott fan. I always choose them when I can. This property sits right on the Stemmons freeway, which is quite noisy, all the time. I was able to get a room in the middle, so the noise was much less noise. The chair in my room (room 525) looked like a cat used it for a scratching post!! The room looks as if it had been updated recently. The bathrooms in this 2 room suite are quite small, and the exhaust fan in one sounds like a jet taxiing down the runway.They do provide free food in the evening, but it's gone by about 6:30, so don't be late! Breakfast is typical RI fare. I do wish Marriott would reevaluate the coffee choice for their properties. It's kind of bland in all locations that don't have a Starbucks.On a positive note, the staff was friendly, and the beds were very comfy!!

"I stayed here for a big technology conference and while I usually don't write reviews, I feel compelled to write one for this place because it has a lot of potential, but they are missing the boat on some really important stuff right now.Ok, first the good stuff:It's quieter than most places in downtown. It's kind of tucked away (at least the ground floor rooms are) and that made for very pleasant sleeping. I've stayed at many other downtown hotels where I had to wear earplugs to block out the honking and yelling and all the other noises of downtown.The internet is really fast. I clocked it about 10mb/s down and up. And it was very reliable, too.The rooms are newly renovated with very comfortable beds, and a lot of space overall for a downtown hotel room.The service were always very friendly.Now the bad stuff:The bathroom was a like a bad, cruel joke. The hot water came on when it felt like it and turned off again just as easily. I frequently waited over ten minutes (I timed it) for the hot water to come on. Just standing there, naked and freezing, until it was finally warm enough to shower. At other times (usually right when I was about to call the front desk to complain) it came on instantly. One time I was in the middle of a shower and the hot water mostly went away (the water wasn't freezing, but it wasn't warm enough, either) for about 5 minutes, then came back even though I hadn't touched the faucet.If that wasn't bad enough, there no shelves in the shower! So I just had to leave all my stuff (shampoo, conditioner, razor, etc.) lying on the floor of the shower. Oh, and to top it all off, there wasn't a shower door, either - only half of the shower had a wall, so the other half let water out all over the floor. I almost forgot: another dumb thing about the bathroom: the light is on a motion sensor, which is a good idea generally, except in the middle of the night when I stumbled in and was blinded when all the lights came on.One day, they decided to test the alarm system at 10:30am, right when I was in the middle of trying to get some work done. They tested it over and over, and it was painfully loud and jarring. Also, I told the front desk I was going to use the gym (which is a few blocks away, but is actually really nice - it's called Active Sports Club and they have great equipment, free weights, squat rack, smith bar, and even a pool) and he told me all I needed to bring was my hotel key. That was wrong - you also need your ID - so I had to come back to get that.Something that didn't bother me, but it might matter to other people: the TV guide shows a whole bunch of channels, but they only actually offer the over-the-air broadcast channels. There are a few other random things that are annoying but I assume they'll fix. For example, they told me I could get free water from a dispenser (the water in the room is 3 per bottle!!) but the dispenser was broken, so I had to find water at the conference I was going to. Also, they have temporary signs up with the room numbers which also have brail, but since it's printed, the brail is completely useless. It just feels very poorly managed and not well thought out.All things considered, the bad far outweigh the good, at least for now. If they fix the bathrooms and complete the renovation, it might be a pretty good option. But for now, at the prices they're charging, you can do much better.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this feedback. We greatly value your comments and will review all of them with our team to help us improve. We are pleased you found the staff friendly, rooms quiet and comfy. We hope to have the chance to impress you on a future stay. Thank you again for sharing this with us.",Neutral
"PRO: Decent location, although you'll have to drive/taxi to most things in Buckhead. Hotel is clean, quiet, and no valet parking to deal with. The continental breakfast had a decent selection, and the young man working there was helpful and pleasant.CON: Front desk personnel were not rude, but not friendly. Room did not stay cool, even with controls turned to cooler and low cool. The reason I'll never return was the midnight phone call from the front desk asking why we had called them. ( We'd retired at 10PM!) No apology, just a defensive statement. Obviously, the front desk staff missed the memo on how to talk with guests, and if they make a mistake--apologize. It's a clean, fairly basic hotel--but we'll stay elsewhere next time. I'd rather pay a little more and feel like my business is appreciated.With new management, new staff and new A/C I would ask give us another try.

"Me, hubby and our 13 year old daughter stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our journey around the West Coast and had a pleasant stay at this hotel. We stayed on the second floor which had a small dining area and outside patio. The room was a bit on the small side but had everything we needed and was clean.Location is great. It is at the bottom of Lombard street so you go straight up the giant mountain of a hill to the crooked street. If you're able I would recommend trying to walk up and down this at least once - it is hilarious! We went on a city tour which picked us up outside our hotel, saw a few buses that done that. Everything is in blocks and so easy to use the map from this hotel. We walked to 'Little Italy', 'Chinatown', 'Japantown' and Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Breakfast is pastries, coffee and bananas/apples. Lovely pastries but may be nice to have cereal as an option too We were able to find a parking space although the reviews are right, they are tight. We had a Jeep Liberty and was able to find and fit into a space though so not too bad. Only negative would be that the hairdryer in our hotel room didn't work. We mentioned it to the reception who allowed me to use one from another (vacant I might add) room which was great, but the hairdryer wasn't fixed during our stay.",Neutral

"First of all I want to say this was a good trip but not because of the MOTEL. We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously.

"Overall it wasn't too bad except when we asked for two extra blankets we only received one. When the housekeepers came to clean they took all 5 of our towels and only replaced them with three. This was not acceptable due to the fact that we had 3 small children with us. Once settled into our room, we received an upmost unwelcome guest: ANOTHER HOTEL GUEST. This hotel double booked and KEYED our room. My wife was breastfeeding and a stranger walked into our room. This is entirely unacceptable. Hotel management was informed, and an apology was given. In my opinion not enough considering it was a Courtyard by Marriott! It was unfortunate there was no continental breakfast even though this was known before check-in. Bed: Comfortable king size bed. Clean covers, fresh scent, pillows were clean and smelled great. There was pull out single sized pull out bed from the chair. Yes I said chair, NOT couch. There were spare pillows in the closet as extras. Bathroom: Shower only in this room. We were disappointed because this was not shared with us until we were in the room. There was a single sink. The normal were also there for use like shampoo, conditioner and soap. Hair dryer also as standard. There was also a single serve coffee pot (stainless steel.)Entertainment: There was a 32 flat screen TV with cable. Wireless internet was free, but very slow. Note: wireless was free for basic surfing. ie: Facebook, google, Myspace, ect. These small, non memory intensive sites are included. HOWEVER, if you wanted video chat, HD Skype, or other business needs, you would need to pay 3.99/stay for this upgraded internet. Comfort: There was AC in this room to help keep us cool and remove some of the humidity. There was a digital thermostat. Staff must turn off the AC before you arrive, because it was humid and warm when you enter.Overall: Hotel is worth the price. I suggest requesting a twin Queen room if you are traveling with a family or a couple that doesn't share the same bed. A King sized room with 2 adults and 3 small children didn't suit us. We would stay here again but with a different room choice.Thank you for your detailed review of our hotel.

"We stayed here for two nights. The only reason we booked here was for the parking as we were on a roadtrip. For some reason one of the car parks was shut (think they were decorating) There were only 2 disabled spaces left so we went and asked where to park. The guy at the front desk was very unhelpful, but told us to park in the shaded area in a tight corner. We did as we were told, but felt uneasy about this. The next day 2 cars had completely blocked us in, good job we weren't needing the car until the next day. Thank goodness that the other car park appeared to open that day as we were no longer blocked in. Check-in was OK- the guy seemed disinterested and had no customer service skills whatsoever. He obviously did not want to be there. Not a good start to our San Fan.Our room was OK- dated but relatively clean and comfortable. The location was good right on Lombard street and 10 minutes walk from Fishermans wharf. Was good that we could have coffee or orange juice and some pastries in the foyer for breakfast. Very basic but did the job.

"I chose to stay here on a 4 night trip due to location and price, while the location was great the room was smaller than what I expected. There was not enough room on the floor to even open my suitcase. In the scheme a things not a big deal but definitely a surprise. In terms of cleaning day three I was greeted with a penis straw on the floor when i entered my room, not sure how this fell out of house cleanings supplies - but it had not been there before! Then there was the elevator trips, being pushed aside while a man stacked his 2 bikes in the lift made me wonder what I got myself in for. I also chose this hotel as it included breakfast, I was not advised at check in and in the elevator on day one another guest advised it was in the bottom level - unfortunately there was not a lot left and no where to sit, it was definitely a backpacker hostel feel and I never went back. All these things combined - it was a quirky place that provided a bed, bathroom and great location - there is plenty within walking distance.Hello Kylie, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay.

"In the past I have stayed in Hotel Circle which is difficult to navigate if you are not familiar with the area and the freeways. That area is also very, very busy with lots of traffic. The Best Western Mission Bay was literally right over the bridge from Mission Bay which made getting to the water very easy. However, I was disappointed that there are no ocean views from any of the rooms. Being this close to the water, I thought there would be.My room was comfortable, though there were some snags. First, the red light on my phone kept flashing the entire length of my stay, even though I told the front desk about it immediately upon my check in. It was a three week old message to someone who had stayed in that room previously.Also, the ice machine did not work on my floor, and I had to go to another floor every time I needed ice. Again, I informed the front desk about the non-functioning ice machine within an hour of my arrival and they just told me to use one on another floor. (I was on the top floor, and the elevator was s---l---o---w.) The ice machine still was not fixed by the end of my stay.The third annoyance was that there was no remote for the television when I checked in. However, they did send someone to my room with a remote within 20 minutes of my calling the front desk.On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff friendly. The best thing was the complimentary breakfast every morning. It had something for everyone and was very good. This really is a welcome amenity for me, since I don't like having to search out and drive to a restaurant first thing in the morning to have breakfast.The Best Western Mission Bay is a comfortable, no frills, convenient place to stay if you are just looking for a place to sleep and change clothes. Overall it seemed clean and safe. A few steps up from a Motel 6, but not a fancy resort either. A good compromise for the price.Good Afternoon,We would like to thank you for staying with us and posting a review for Tripadvisor.Thank you so much for your compliments to our property. As a valued guest, your comments are very much appreciated and we take it in a constructive way so we can do better. I apologize the ice machine was not working at the time. Our maintenance team has inspected and has now been fix.Here at the Best Western Mission Bay, we aim to make every guest stay a great experience.

This hotel is in a great location to walk to sites in Seattle. The room was small for a suite but was clean and comfortable. The layout of the room was kind of awkward and you could not lay in bed and watch the TV. The breakfast buffet was complementary and was wonderful. We were disappointed that the one and only night we stayed there the pool area was closed. I chose this hotel because it was downtown and had a pool. We were offered a shuttle to another hotel to use the pool there but that seemed silly.,Neutral
"I stayed here with my fiance on a one night trip to Atlanta. The rooms and bathrooms were nice (though the shower pressure in my particular room was not good, luckily I wasn't washing my hair so it wasn't a huge issue). However, the AC was really loud, and while it didn't disturb my sleep, it did wake my fiance up about 5 times throughout the night (whenever it came on), so he didn't sleep very well. I wanted to turn it to where the fan was always on but that didn't seem to be an option. The breakfast was also nice with a good selection of fruits and cereals (plus yogurt, bagels and waffles and things like that). I also like the nice, random touch of funny sayings in the elevator. My biggest issue come from the fact that I left a shirt in the room. It was a nicer brand and new top that was 75. I remember taking it out of my bag and draping it over the desk chair. I realized it when I got home and called, however, housekeeping had gone home for the day so I had to wait until the next day for answers. After 2 days of back and forth they told my fiance they couldn't find it anywhere. I know I left it there because we went from the hotel to straight home and neither of us had it in our bags and I remembered taking it out of mine. I'm sure it was swiped and I'm really upset that this would happen at a Hilton-based hotel. Sadly, this left me with a bad impression on an otherwise decent hotel.Dear Stephanie M,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center.

"I'm a rewards member with another hotel, but was sold on the Hotel Diva's Little Diva's kids' suite because my kids sleep better in separate beds. I drummed up anticipation of their first visit to SF by telling them about bunk beds, a Wii, a Mac and pouf chairs in their separate room next to ours.My husband reserved May 11 for our 7-night stay at the end of July. He had a message the morning of our flight from the hotel, received after 8 PM EST the evening before our 7:30 AM flight, that the hotel didn't have a room for us.He managed to reach a live person after our flight landed, and she told him that there was another room available. Upon arrival, we were told that we could 1) stay in the kids' suite in the sister hotel 3 blocks away, but only for five days, and then have to switch out (unfortunately I was too tired to ask at the time why we would have had to switch instead of the other party), or 2) we could choose another available suite. My husband didn't want the bother of switching, rooms or to our rewards hotel after hours of traveling, so we chose what later turned out to be a more expensive suite, with a shared bed for the kids. The suite was large and quiet, but no different for the kids than anywhere else.That said, we made the best of our stay in the Diva's convenienty central location. The pleasant staff was helpful in scheduling a couple of excursions and in recommending things to do, which is why I'm rating the hotel three stars. At checkout, I told Carlos that we had enjoyed the city, but would have more if not for the last-minute room change. I wouldn't choose to stay here again on our next visit merely on the strength of this experience.Dear Kovfa,I am so sorry to hear there was a mix up with your Kid Suite reservation. Please extend my apologies to your children. I hope you kids still enjoyed their trip to San Francisco. I hope you and your children will give Hotel Diva another chance on your next visit to SF.

"We recently stayed for 1 night on a King Corner Spa room overnight on Christmas day. I was disappointed that we did not get a suite upgrade. I was told by the front desk that our room already was an upgraded room, which was not true. It was almost like having Inner Circle status didn't matter except that I got my usual requested amenity. The room itself was decent and in true Kimpton style, Solamar had its own quirks with its nautical theme. It's starting to look a bit dated so hopefully they will renovate soon. The jacuzzi was good but nothing to die for. It was also bad that the restaurant was closed as I always want to try Kimpton's restaurants. I might stay here again but I'll probably consider the other Kimpton hotel down the street on our next San Diego trip.Hi Carlo, thanks for staying with us and for taking the time to post a review. The King Spa Corner room is indeed an upgraded room and our standard rooms aren't quite as large as the King Spa Corner, nor do they have the Fuji Soaking Tub like the one in your room. We have 16 suites on property of our 235 rooms, and they certainly get reserved up quickly. Sorry about the restaurant being closed during your stay. Jsix is an amazing restaurant, although it was time for a quick refresh. The new look is going to better match the amazing cuisine. We certainly hoped to impress you during your stay better than we did on this trip. I hope we get another chance on your next trip to San Diego, as we want our IC members happy at all costs.

"My family and I recently, December 2017, spent several days at this particular Best Western. We had three rooms with exterior access on the third floor. The second night there we realized why we were so warm was that our window was ajar by about 6 inches. So we closed and locked the window, and called the front office to inquire why it was opened. The front office said housekeeping must have opened it. I had my family close their windows also.Imagine our dismay the next day, when we stopped back to our rooms around 5pm, and all our windows were once again open. It would have been an easy matter for anyone to take a knife and slit the screen, slide the window fully open, and climb into our rooms. One of our rooms was occupied by a 23 yr old young woman. We once again relocked our windows. I can only guess that housekeeping was instructed to turn off the air conditioning, it was mid-70's, and open the window when they cleaned the rooms. I noticed other rooms on the 2nd floor were also left the same way.When I checked out I told Bill the manager that compromising the safety of guests was not acceptable. And, my guess is that housekeeping was told to open all the windows as part of the daily routine. I was not pleased he blamed housekeeping. I promised to inform Best Western at corporate headquarters and write a review, and I did both. Corporate was very supportive and shared my concern in regards to hotel safely. I have no doubt they took the appropriate action and future guests are now safe. But, check your windows when you return each night!Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are very sorry housekeeping kept your windows open during your stay. It's not a policy that we keep them closed but after mentioning it to the front desk staff.They should have been closed after they were done cleaning the rooms. Also they're are devices that keep our windows from opening more than 6 inches to prevent intruders from entering the room. We are very sorry you felt your safety was compromised but I assure you that never has there been any incidents were any of our rooms have been broken into.",Neutral
"We stayed here because it was close to the Braves stadium and we are Marriott Rewards members. When we pulled up to check in, there were only people working valet no bell men to help with luggage. No luggage carts out front to get for ourselves. For this level of Marriott property, I would have expected luggage assistance along with a nice, warm welcome but that didnt exist. They were not busy at the time we arrived. I walked right up to the desk and got quickly checked in. Beds were comfortable. Room was ok on cleanliness except for hair in the shower from previous guests. The subfloor of the shower was not good the water pressure was less than satisfactory. I most likely would not stay here again mostly because of the lack of hospitality. Thank you for the feedback. We are sorry to hear that there was no staff present at the front drive to greet and assist you during your arrival and that your room was not up to standards.

"You couldn't ask for a better price for a for a suite with three small rooms that includes breakfast. The total amount of space seemed similar to an Embassy Suite with parents sleeping in one room and two kids in a bunk bed in a second room that you need walk through to get to the bathroom. It is true that the AC was kind of moldy smelling and the room did feel a bit run down and the guests, in general, didn't seem real classy. The immediate location isn't exactly romantic either, but it is well located for driving places in San Diego. The breakfast, by the way, was surprisingly good. If you are used to decent hotels, it will be hard to feel comfortable at this one, and I don't think you would choose this place for a honeymoon. Still, for around 100, I don't think you could find a better value for a quick overnight stay in a suite for a family of four.",Neutral

"My 11 year old daughter and myself stayed here recently. We booked with short notice. The price was very overpriced for what we got, however, it was comparable to other nearby hotels.When our plane landed, I noticed a voicemail from the hotel confirming that we were still coming (the plane landed at noon). I was a bit worried there wouldn't be a room for us, but there was!We arrived at 3 pm and checked in with no issue and no line. We had asked for a top floor and it was granted without issue. We were given chocolate chip cookies when we arrived which was nice.The room was pretty basic, with a very tiny bathroom, but was fine for the two of us for 3 nights. We had a major issue with our shower where it would not turn off. I called the front desk and housekeeping trying to reach a person and no one was answering so I went down to the lobby and there was a large line to check in. I just happened to notice the maintenance man walking by so asked him. He did follow me back and find a way to turn off the shower, but he got muddy boot prints all over the room. He said he would come back the next day to fix the shower fully. The next day, the shower still didn't work right so we had to have them come back again, and there were more muddy boot prints.There were never pool towels both times we swam. The hot tub was very foamy. Not sure what that was about. The pool is quite small and in the parking lot, but fine for the kids.The rooms are not very soundproof and you can hear people walking by your room (I can only imagine what the rooms by the pool were like), however, with the A/C on, it does dull out a lot of the noise.The breakfast is from 7-9 only. Would have preferred at least a 6:30 am start. It is VERY basic. Thin white bread, doughnuts, hard boiled eggs, fruit loops and corn flakes. I know it is a continental breakfast, but would have liked to have seen them change it up a bit with maybe muffins, croissants, bagels, etc. Regardless, most places don't have a breakfast, so it is better than nothing.The wifi is terrible. It barely works. However, the most annoying thing was on the last day, when we woke up, the original wifi password they gave me no longer worked. I went down to the lobby to get a new one, and that one didn't work either!The biggest perk of this place is that it is VERY close to Disneyland. You cannot really get closer, so that was great.I think with a few minor changes (make sure pool towels are regularly stocked, improve wifi, change variety of breakfasts, etc) it could make the experience completely different.",Neutral

"This is a relatively nice, smaller sized motel in a not-touristy area. I'm sure great for families of students attending SDSU, but not a place I'd really recommend if you want to come for even a short vacation in San Diego. However, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the rooms were clean and maintained. Parking lot is on the small side and the breakfast area is really, really tight. Lots of construction happening in the area, making navigating the streets a bit more difficult. You need a car to get around, walking will get you to fast food places only. Overall, an OK place for a short stop.Dear Valued Guest, hank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. I was pleased that our staff made your stay a pleasurable one. They truly are a large part of why we rate so highly with our guests. I am sorry you were disappointed in our location. As you mentioned, we are an excellent choice for travelers visiting SDSU, one of Californias largest universities (1 mile), or Qualcomm Stadium (2 miles), but we are also close to major freeways that can get you to many attractions, usually under 15 minutes. Regarding restaurants in the area, the staff has a list of really excellent restaurants within a mile or so of the hotel. These are not big, fancy restaurants, but many of them are very nice, including Bridges Bar Grill, only a block away from the hotel. This is one area where our dedication to customer service really shows, we try to direct our guests to local places that we love ourselves.You mentioned the construction, it is true, our neighborhood is going through some major changes that we are very excited about. New commercial and housing buildings are sprouting up, they will bring new energy to our area.It is sometimes a challenge to set the right expectations for our guests. I think we do a pretty good job on our website, and the majority of our guests have written honest reviews about their experience with us, what makes us standout from the rest and why they rate us so highly on TripAdvisor. Our hotel is a modest AAA 2-diamond property, with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. We believe it is well located, friendly and very clean.

"Stayed for 3 nights in a two bed double room with my wife and son. The room had a musty smell, and the beds were the smallest I've ever had in a USA hotel...it was clean though, if old, and the bathroom was very big for the size of the room. However, I ended up paying over 200 a night, which even in San Francisco is a crazy amount for what is essentially just an old motel.On the plus side, the staff were friendly, and it's located in a nice, safe feeling area, just round the corner from a great shopping and eating street on Union St in Cow Hollow, which I'd highly recommend.It is what it is....if you can get a good rate then great, if not I'd shop around.",Neutral
"You would hope that since they have done this two times prior that they would take points from the neighboring villas. Rooms and room sizes aside (fantastic!) the service at this resort in VERY under par so far. We prebooked pool chairs over a month prior and they messed those up. Pool service is essentially none existent.... even when they say theyll send someone. Other then having pre booked chairs at the pool so you dont need to guard some seats at 7:00am dont expect - your money to go further then that. No extra service or help. Actually we had to change chairs 3 times day one as per their screw up. Room service. Also SO SLOW. Over 1 hour for coffee pancakes and bacon.

"Very very conveniently located to Honda Center, Anaheim stadium, restaurants, Starbucks. Nice safe area. Our room was overlooking pool and noise echoed in our room until 10PM. Halls were loud with people talking. By the number of kids present it's obviously a popular place for Disney goers. So it is what it is. Rooms were old and need of updating. I'm sure they get more than their fair share of abuse. But not terrible by any means. Nice to have a kitchenette. And the AM breakfast buffet was good.",Neutral
"We stayed at this property for one night pre-cruise. I selected this property as I am Marriott Platinum, and it did not seem too far to walk to some of the attractions for our day in the city - and for less than another Marriott closer to the cruise pier. I'm not certain it was 100 the best decision.Yes, it is about a mile walk to the market - not too bad. We are walkers, so that is and was not an issue. In hindsight, it was raining significantly the entire day we were in the city. We were prepared for it so definitely not a challenge. What I realized, though, is the next morning after we had breakfast, it was really nice out and we wanted to go back to the market. We had to plan for that as it was about a 30 minute RT walk. Again - great exercise, but really would have been nice to enjoy the market for longer first thing in the morning and to walk along the water... The other thing to note is - that this property is located RIGHT NEXT TO the highway. So you will see and hear the rush hour traffic. The windows in the room did well with blocking out a lot of the noise and we were not kept awake by the traffic noise.We arrived around 10:00am, and our room was not ready. Wasn't fully expecting it to - you just never know. I was told it would be a few hours for my reserved room to be ready and it was at that time that I asked if there were any rooms available for a complimentary upgrade as I am platinum. We were told no - they were not available either. We waited about an hour for our room, but we had already left for our sightseeing after dropping our luggage. Honestly, I don't think that the room we received was a true upgrade but for one night it doesn't really matter.The lobby is inviting, textiles seem updated and the bar and restaurant are all right there. The restaurant does offer happy hour specials on select beverages and appetizers. Once we did return to check into our room, it was simply ok. It was NOT the as listed on the Marriott website Category 7 experience that we were expecting. It felt more like we were in a Days Inn. The kitchen gave us what we needed - a small refrigerator but the plates and utensils were paper and plastic I wasn't expecting that. And when we went to use one of the utensil combo packs, one of them was opened with the fork removed. Tossed that and we just used a fork and spoon from the unopened pack. The bed was comfortable and we slept just fine. Closet was super small didn't bother to put much in it - it would have been a hassle. Bathroom shower was really great with fabulous water pressure and we did not experience any fluctuation in the temperature. I did ask for a blanket to be in my room upon arrival via the Marriott app, and I didn't realize until crawling into bed that it was not delivered. So I got onto the app again, and after a few attempts was able to connect with someone - simply because I couldn't reach anyone on the phone. They did show up after about 45 minutes... But instead of a blanket, they brought an entire bed set - comforter, sheets and pillows. I was too tired to care at that point and just took it all. I used the 2nd comforter just to get to sleep, and tossed it off when I got overly hot. But I thought it was strange that the hotel didn't have any blankets Kind of them to deliver me something though!Breakfast was very busy. It is definitely a large buffet and will get you by. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, fruits, oatmeal. Food was fresh and replenished regularly. It definitely worked for our needs. Because we were out in the rain all day and wanted to get back to the hotel to rest for a bit, we did decide to not go out for dinner and take advantage of the hotel restaurant. We sat in the bar area right next to the warm fireplace - fabulous! I had the chicken entree my husband the burger. Food was good portions were large, and our bartender / waiter was kind and helpful.The Uber ride from this hotel to the cruise pier was about 25. Overall, I'm not sure if the varying cost difference to stay at this property vs. a full-service Marriott was entirely worth it. This hotel does need some updating for sure! Totally not a category 7. For the additional money for the Uber ride, and not having access to the concierge lounge for breakfast as well as evening happy hour - having to pay for dinner and the taxi ride would have leveled out the additional cost to stay at the full-service property. Overall, the staff was kind and gracious, the hotel was clean and accommodating, just dated and out of the way a bit. Would I stay here again Probably not but it did meet our needs for the one night stay.I appreciate you taking the time to write a thoughtful review -- it was a pleasure hosting you prior to your cruise. I'm glad we could provide a comfortable place for you to rest while you explored the city during your short stay. That said, it's a shame your room didn't meet your expectations. We're always happy to provide extra plates and cutlery should you require them. As for the bed set, I'm sorry about the confusion. You should have been brought and blanket, and I apologize that wasn't the case. All in all, thank you very much for leaving a review.

"Can't give a bad review or a good review as there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Being a diamond member there wasn't an upgrade offered, and my preference was to be far away from the elevator but was placed next to it. There was no noise however even though the hotel was full of Mary Kay ladies. Breakfast was crowded but services were fine, food was fresh. Room was clean but no special furniture or comforts and a bit old but nothing to complain about. I wasn't impressed or distressed...

"I was there for two nights. The room was clean and the staff was friendly enough. The bed was comfortable and everything worked well enough. I was disappointed that you had to go to the bar to get ice and, in the evening, things can get a little loud with the patrons at the bar. Overall, I was satisfied with my accommodations, but I can't say I would stay there again for my next SD getaway. I'm not poo-pooing the place, it just wasn't for me.Thanks for the honest review. In the future you can call the front desk or bar and ask them to bring you ice, that was the thought process on not putting an ice machine on our little property. your feedback will better serve us to inform our guests that we are willing to bring ice to our guests.",Neutral
"After a substantial remodel in the lobby and front entry area, one would expect other amenities to match. Unfortunately this hotel seems to be slipping a bit. I've stayed at this hotel a couple dozen times and have experienced dated but comfortable rooms, very comfy beds and pillows and usually fully functioning amenities such as wifi, refrigerator and heat/AC. This trip the water temp was hot to very hot to scalding from both cold and hot water taps. The cold eventually would cool to a usable temperature. As many times as i've stayed here I'd never experienced that. Something definitely wrong somewhere. Also this is the second time the AC failed in the room. With outside temps into the 90's and very humid, my last night in this room was like a sauna. When I checked out the temp in the room was more than 80 degrees. The clerk at the desk said they'd experienced a 'failure' and they comped my parking...okay..nice but not quite the same thing. I've been staying more at Marriott properties in the area this year and will likely return as I've never remotely experienced anything like the above at the Fairfield or Courtyard.",Neutral

"The check-in starts at 3pm, we got there after 7pm and there was nobody in the reception. About ten minutes later a lady showed up, checked us in and only then told us that the housekeeper had forgotten to clean our room, and she was the one doing it! And she needed half an hour to finish up!! Maybe that happened because it was Thanksgiving weekend...We were coming from a long drive that followed a long flight, but since we were also hungry we did not complain. Getting to the room there were no sheets on the beds (only on the mattresses) and no blankets. Since we started off on the wrong foot, it was hard not to notice the small details:The outlets were loose and you could not move the charger cord while charging somethig because it would fall off.We were sharing the room in four people and it got a little small with all the luggage we had.The bathroom was not the cleanest, and the way to control the temperature of the water is awful.The TV was big and looked pretty good but did not work. It was almost impossible not to accidentally hit it.

"My Wife and 2 daughters stayed for 5 nights in early April 2012 and had booked a Family room with 2 double beds. The room turned out to be much smaller than expected (after staying in many family rooms in UK) .The beds were 3/4 size at best and with one small wardrobe and 4 hangers (1 each) we decided to book another room. To be fair the staff (whilst they could do little about the extortionate rate we had to pay for the additional room) were very helpful and understanding and this continued during the stay. There are 6 rooms on each floor of the hotel and with 36 floors and just 2 lifts there can sometimes be a wait. Breakfast was included and was basic and the breakfast room a bit to small for the number of guests the food was always hot and fresh (Omelets , Sausage patties , bagels Etc) and the staff were helpful. Even though the address is Times square you are probably a good 10 - 15 minuet walk to the centre (Red Steps) which is not really an issue as you are located about the same walk from the Hells Kitchen area which is famed for it diverse restaurants. We took out the 3 day New York pass which we found to be good vale (approx 130 pp) and gets you into all the main attractions and also includes the Water Taxi and Manhattan Cruise (Well recommended). Whilst there we saw Sister Act after buying the tickets at the TKTS booth (located under the red steps in times square). The booth opens at 10am most days for matinee shows and 3pm for evening performances. Best advice is get there early as queues can be large but in fairness do move quickly one box office opens. We paid 66 each which was much cheaper than cost of pre booking in UK. All in all I can not say it was an unpleasant stay at the hotel as New York is more about the city than the room , however I would look for something else if you are after a larger family type room.Hi Andybev123!

(A man checking in at the same time asked about shuttle to stadium he wasn't happy when told the hotel didn't offer one as it is so close. Hint - check directly with hotel if something is very important to your stay.)Breakfast was included in the rate - standard fare - small dining room but take out containers were included so you could take food back to your room. The person working at breakfast was very nice and concerned that everything was OK.We stayed one night so didn't use the kitchen in our room. Room had double bed, small sofa bed, desk and one chair so it would have been difficult to comfortably eat.

"We traveled a tremendous amount of distance by car to get to the hotel. We had an important family event in Smyrna. The hotel location is great for people coming from out of town. The stay was pretty good - the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was tasty although it would have been nice to provide turkey products for those who do not eat pork. The workout equipment was outdated and in need of repair. The manual in the room did not advertise tourist attractions.All staff were courteous.

"I booked this hotel last minute through a 3rd party site and paid about 75 less than advertised. However, I still thought it was overpriced for the cleanliness and maintenance of the property.I did call the hotel the day before to see if they would meet the online price or if they'd offer a different last minute discount. The girl in reservations couldn't have cared less about why I was visiting or anything I had to say. She was very obviously reading off a script and refused to break it (not even to gain relationship with a potential guest). I questioned even booking because of her, but decided not to let one person sour my opinion of the business. Good:The location is fantastic for touristy things. Just a couple blocks from Pier 41 and 39. Easy walk to Alcatraz ferry. Convenient to many public transport lines.When I came in to check in, a gentleman welcomed me right away and made sure I was in the correct line. The room was very spacious. Though it was just me, they put me in a room with 2 double beds. There was ample space around all the furniture to move around. There was a mini fridge, Keurig (with coffee, cream, tea, decaf, etc), and bottled water. There was a fold down seat in the shower which would be a great amenity for someone who has a hard time standing long enough to shower. The TV was huge and they provided a great cheat sheet on how to use it. The hotel provided coupons for local restaurants. Very cute nautical decorations. The seagull pillows were adorable. Not so good:Cleaning was only okay. There was trash on the floor, hair in the shower, and rust from a leaking toilet that easily wiped off. It was loud, but I'm not sure what from. There was a banging, almost construction noise that would happen fairly often day and night. I was able to sleep through it. None of the staff knew much about the area other than the handful of places they all pushed. There was a very rough around the edges feel with peeling paint, damaged wallpaper, etc.There was no mattress cover. There was just a thin protector on top of the mattress and then the sheet. This seems odd for a hotel.The provided shampoo and conditioner did not work well. To be fair, I did not make the hotel aware of my dissatisfaction with any of these items during my stay thus not providing an opportunity to fix anything. I would stay here again for 1 or 2 nights. It was comfortable and conveniently located. Dear greenbeanjean26,Thank you for such a detailed review of your experience while staying at Hotel Zephyr.

"Stayed here for a few nights while in town for a trade show at the Cobb Galleria. This hotel has easy access to the Cobb Galleria as it is connected. The location of the hotel is about 30 minutes outside of downtown Atlanta. You will definitely need a car to get around. The hotel itself is modern and updated. It looks like the rooms have been recently renovated. The reason I gave the hotel only 3 stars is because there were a few hiccups during my stay. I don't want to get into specifics and make this whole review, a complaint. I would recommend the hotel if staying in the area for business.

"As another reviewer wrote a Pro - Con list, I have a similar list. We had a suite with 2 queen beds and a pullout couch. Travelling were 2 adults, a 15 yr old and a 12 yr old.Pros:1.

Slightly larger than bar fridge in the rooms with coffee maker, dishwasher, utensils, plates, pots, microwave.5. Across the street from McDonald's.6. 5 min walk from QFC Market7. Across the street from Space Needle, EMP museum8. Helpful and courteous staff9. Large flat screen TV with good selection of channels.10. Free shuttle to locations within 5 min of driving11. We got a good view of the Seafair Parade as it went by the hotel.12. 6-7 min walk to several casual restaurants Cons:1. Parking is expensive, 30 USD/day (after taxes)2. You only have access to the parking lot from one of two elevators. The elevator has an entrance and a control panel on each side. You need your room key to operate it but only one side of the elevator has a sensor. 3. If you don't want to take the elevator (because there is always a long wait in the morning with people checking out and wanting to eat the free breakfast) you can't take the stairs even if you're on the 2nd floor as it is used only as an emergency exit and goes outside and not to the lobby. Also the exit door is alarmed. 4. Housekeeping didn't come clean our room until after 5 everyday which was annoying when you just want to relax if you've been out for the day.5. They only give you 1 small bottle of shampoo and conditioner unless you request more.Dear oombellaThank you for taking the time out of your schedule to complete this review regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

I asked for extra towels and foam pillows, never got either.

"Going to Old Town San Diego is so much fun and worth it. The reason that I didn't give this Best Western a better rating is because I've stayed at much nicer ones and there is an expectation on the Plus....but I did waffle between Aver. and Very Good. I think you can't go wrong for the location, but with that being said, the hotel is built on a hill and if you're looking for convenience in parking...be advised....yes, there's parking for an extra 15 and if the lot is full, well, be prepared to do street parking on a very steep hill and do some walking. There is valet parking for more , but after the price of the room, I didn't want to add to my bill. I didn't really mind the street parking b/c I ended up being lucky to be closer to the upper entrance...and, I'm fit and up for a little exercise, but if you're not, be prepared for that! Speaking of hills, being in the very upper part of the hotel there's a lot of outside stairs (that were beautiful in the setting), and there is a elevator, but can be a bit confusing finding your way by walking back down to the lobby. The entire hotel is broken up into different buildings, so I really don't know what the bottom part is like, but the upper blding room seemed nice when first walking in - they did a good job in decor, but to be honest (and why I didn't give it a better rating) it was pretty shabby - bathroom especially and the visual made it feel not so clean (I was one step away from laying down towels to make a pathway) and for 246.21 for a night there, I did expect a little better. I do realize it's in a prime location and that must be the rub! The lobby was very nice and I can't speak to the rooms lower down, but in peanut heaven, I think they need an upgrade! The morning coffee in the lobby wasn't anything special - it's the standard fare - fake creamers no raw sugar packets!It's such a great location...close to Coronado Island and especially to the airport if you have an early flight! It was perfect after a week at family wedding to end up there the day before flying out, was perfect! So, maybe it was very good, but I'm still giving it an average rating for the price!Thank you for your review and recommendations! Please come and see us again. We designed the decor and garden setting to match the vintage California style of Old Town. I am pleased to know there were many areas you found satisfaction in. We hope you will stay again.

"Never have I spent so much on a hotel that seemed so unsure of itself.When I walked in it was a very contemporary design, I was excited for what was to come! Got off the elevator and the hallways were a retro kind of green floral print. I thought, Maybe it gets contemporary again the rooms Open my door and saw a country style shower curtain and a very traditional hotel room styling in the room. Four design styles in one place! Weird. The room itself was nice though, and very clean. Love having an additional morning prep area to dry my hair, the bathrooms are always too humid in hotels. (Bring your own hairdryer though, mine kept shutting off.)After getting settled I went down to the fitness center. It is probably THE BEST hotel fitness center I have used. The only issue was that to get to it, I basically had to walk through a trade show that was taking place. Awkward! (Even more so when I left the gym all sweaty and walked among the business people!)Finally, I ordered room service for dinner. It was delicious! Loved my salad and the burger was top notch. The server was friendly and timely. When i went to bed - I got annoyed quickly. The hotel is setup such that it is a cube, with no middle. When you step out of your room, you can look over the balcony and see all the way down to the lobby. This would be fine if the doors were heavier. I could hear EVERYTHING happening down at the bar on the first floor and I was on the 10th! Frustrating!",Neutral

It was OK .. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the walls are thin, and sounded like a herd of elephants in the room above us, early in the morning. I would suggest a higher-floor room, we were on the first floor. But, I can't say anything about the elevator situation. Don't see us needing to stay in SD again anytime soon, and there is really nothing about this property that beckons me back.

"I recently stayed here for 5 days and I felt so uncomfortable, I didn't use any of the amenities. I travel with my service dog and felt I was mistreated by the person working at the front desk. Rick P was very condescending and not at all welcoming. He basically called me a liar and asked inappropriate questions regarding my service dog. He was overall an arrogant person. I felt like I was a prisoner in this hotel for fear of being ridiculed by staff. Staff for the most part just wanted to get the job done and didn't have time for cordial interactions. Room was okay, nothing special about this hotel -- Overpriced for what it is. The first interaction I had was with Rick, so nothing that the hotel could offer could make that better. They should train their staff on how to act with people with disabilities. Since then, I've been to other hotels that have treated me and my dog 10 times better than this place. Won't stay at any of their branches again out of principle.I certainly appreciate you writing a survey regarding your stay with us. I was made aware of this situation and have since reviewed ADA policy in regards to service animals, with all my front desk staff. I'm sorry you felt uncomfortable while staying with us, that is certainly not our objective. We are a hotel that does not allow pets, but service animals are not considered Pets by the ADA. We like any other business, are required by law to allow all animals being identified as service animals entry into the building.

Rooms definitely smaller than I thought. Had a three night stay with my parents. Wish I could have afforded two rooms since this one was too small for three adults in my opinion. High floor and away from elevator. Noise was minimal from the 14th although I could see how it would be disturbing closer to street level. Location within walking distance of several restaurants and about 7 min walk to Union Square. Supposedly had a handicap bathroom which was huge- just didn't have any assist hand rails by the toilet. Towels were very thin. Air condition was way too loud. Never been to a Marriott without headboards on the beds. Felt incomplete to me. Valet Parking over 60 a day. I self parked at a garage around the corner for 30/day. Inconvenient but I guess that's big city life. Very limited cafe menu as compared to other Marriotts I've stayed at. Also limited channels on the TV. No room safe. Staff was very pleasant at the front desk as well as the valet team. While I'm a longtime devoted Marriott customer I probably wouldn't stay at this location again. Too many small things that I didn't like that would send me elsewhere for a future trip. folk108 - Thank you for taking time to share your honest feedback. I sincerely apologize that your recent visit did not exceed your expectation as a Marriott loyal traveler though glad to read that our Front Desk and Valet attendants provided excellent service.

"This was my first time staying at this hotel. There were many pros and a few cons. First the pros - the price was great and parking was FREE. Yes, you read that correctly. FREE. Very few hotels in New Orleans have free parking. The parking was also secured. Hotel staff were fantastic - all were very friendly and eager to please their guests. The location was terrific - on St.Charles Avenue. You could sit outside on the small patio and watch the streetcar go by. Great place for people watching too. Excellent Tex-Mex restaurant next door. The hotel is small, so not so many people that you get lost in the crowd. Breakfast was outstanding. Lots of choices for a small hotel. It was also quiet. I particularly liked the reading library loan option on my floor (2nd) and enjoyed a John Grisham novel while I was staying there. There were only a few cons - my room was musty and seemed damp. The elevator was broken while I was there, but the hotel staff did offer to carry my bags up and down. I'm planning another trip to NOLA in the near future and will go back to see if things have improved a bit.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I'm glad that you enjoyed the hotel despite the out-of-order elevator. I apologize that you were inconvenienced in any way.

"The guestroom was average. It felt rather cold due to lots of empty space. Management may wish to add some furniture and accessories to make the rooms feel warmer.Unfortunately, our room location was near the elevator so throughout the night we heard beeping and the running of the motor for the elevator car. The bathroom was dated and needs a refresh. It could've been a little cleaner as well.Notwithstanding the above, the hotel's location is excellent. It's near many of the local attractions including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell center, shopping on Walnut Street and local restaurants. Also on the positive side, the common areas of the hotel are very well maintained and a pleasure to walk through. We stayed at a hotel because we were attending a wedding and the hotel catering was very good. The event people did a great job. While we are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your event and found our location convenient, we apologize if our guest room did not meet your expectations.

"Stayed here on the recommendation of other Trip Advisor reviews, and believed the location just outside the French Quarter was perfect, and was sadly disappointed. Stayed over the St Patrick's Day weekend. Even though I said the reason I chose this hotel was based on reviews that I'd previously stayed in the French Quarter it was too noisy .... No, they gave us a 2nd floor room right over the street the dumpster. Noisy every morning between 3am 6am- except Sunday. But, the room was always clean, plenty of fresh towels bathroom amenities, as well as a fridge, microwave, big screen HD TV with premium channels ( not that we were in the room long enough to watch them, but...). Room was smallish (not as small as NYC basic), but room enough. The courtyard is nothing more than a small alleyway with flowers, shrubs some places to sit. One draw was the coffee croissants delivered to your room - which was nice the first morning, then I had to go downstairs to the coffee station in the lobby to get more cream, then had to be sure to request it the next morning, and the last morning had to ask at the desk for any cream was told very matter-of-factly, I guess we're out .... Didn't seem to be much of a concern ..... Will look elsewhere next time....",Neutral
"I have recently returned from a 5 day stay in Holiday Inn Express New York Times Square. The hotel is very basic and unless all you want the room for is to sleep then do not stay here.We arrived at the hotel and greeted by the reception team who were very pleasant and helpful. We were given rooms 2001, 2004 and 2006 which were on the 20th floor. The rooms were very small but were clean. Our air conditioning was not working but was fixed once reported to reception. Our beds were not changed once on our visit, also where I made the bed in the morning just to make the room tidy, the housekeeping never actually fixed the bed. They advise you use the same towels rather than them having to keep changing them but when requested clean towels they would happily bring you some.The hotel has around 132 rooms and only 2 lifts that can hold up to 6-8 people so waiting for the lift especially breakfast time could be frustrating. The breakfast room is tiny considering how many people are in the hotel. Breakfast is mainly muffins, bagels and pastries, this was ok but after 5 days it became very repetitive and quite sickly.When booking this hotel as it said Times Square I thought I would actually be in time square but its is a good 10 15 minutes walk away.Hotel is average and I do not think I would stay here againThank you very much for sharing your honest and candid feedback with us. We are disappointed in ourselves for letting you leave our hotel with an OK impression of your stay. Here at the Holiday Inn Express Times Square, we pride ourselves in providing the best customer service and value despite the challenges we face being located in Midtown Manhattan.

"We stayed at the Hyatt for a Christmas party. The room was everything you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Updated, clean and comfortable. Check in was a nightmare. It took us at least 40 minutes. 3 people at the counter and only one of them was checking in anyone. We knew several of the people waiting in line. Two of them were sent to rooms that already had people in them. Then they had to come and wait in that 40 minute line again to get it straightened out. This sort of service is not what you would normally associate with a Grand Hyatt, especially with the rates they are charging. The Gold desk was not open and the concierge just sat there and did nothing to help either. The valet station was not operating smoothly either, both for check in and check out. All in all, the front of the house here needs some help.",Neutral

"I have always stayed in a other hotel when visiting Dallas, but they didn't have availability this time for two days. i ended up staying here for half my visit and then moving to my regular hotel. After two days of living here, I could have stayed on. I loved the location, there is a Starbucks and CVS at a walkable distance - just across from the hotel. The rooms are clean, and big sized. It's structured like a suite, so you get some living room space too. The kitchen is well equipped. It's well connected, they have a complimentary wi if service and the internet speed is good. The only downside being that the area is not considered very safe, but I didn't encounter any issues.The breakfast is very average, No in-house restaurant. I don't like their wash rooms, very small and the products are very very average - I would recommend to carry your own shampoo, body wash etc along. The staff is friendly and helpful.Thank you for your review and I am glad you enjoyed our spacious rooms.

"We got a good deal through a third party. Room rate was 109 for New Year's Day. Hotel was 2 minute walk from Disney Land and near many food establishments. Rooms were old and relatively clean. Lighting was a bit dim for my taste. Small bathroom, but sink right outside. Had refrigerator and old rusting microwave. Bad news If you are on second floor, you are hauling your suitcases up the stairs. No elevator. Also the shades are plantation shutters that let the sun in at the crack of dawn. Don't forget the occasional roll of a suitcase right by your room, or housekeeping loudly rolling their cart by your room early in the morning. Oh, and for some reason housekeeping knocked on our door at 930AM just to say sorry!! All in all this is a convenience, inexpensive motel disguised as an inn. Clever naming! For the money, the stay was OK but would not repeat.",Neutral

"At first glance this is the Marriott of choice if you're looking for the free breakfast, free wireless, fitness center and comfortable rooms that are standard Marriott fare. With free airport shuttle service I picked this over the Courtyard by Marriott at PHL because of the free hot breakfast here instead of the 12 charge at the Courtyard.I stayed because I had an early flight out in the morning and living just over an hour away didn't want to risk any delays especially with a weekday traffic coming into Philadelphia from New Jersey.So why did I feel cheated I had stayed before at the Courtyard because on that date they had a much better rate and their fly and park rate is 10 a day.The Fairfield Inn offers free parking the night of your stay. I would be returning three days later but they insisted on a 60 parking charge because they only sell parking on a weekly basis there was no prorated offer for the three days I needed.I discovered this as I was checking out so instead of a quick free shuttle to my terminal I had to go to a nearby parking lot to get a better rate and rush to make my flight.If you'll be away for six or seven days it's ok but for three the charge was excessive. I am a Platinum Elite Marriott Rewards member and I can honestly say this was the first time I experienced a policy that didn't have any consideration for the guest's experience.I would like to offer my most sincere apologies for the frustrations you were faced with regarding the park and fly program. All the properties in the area do have their own policies for parking. We do offer complimentary parking for the time that you are staying with us. If you choose to leave your vehicle with us traveling, we do have a fee that is charged. Unfortunately, our hands are tied as far as being able to waive this fee. I once again apologize for this.

"And they were deceived.... We picked the Mandarin in Miami because we had a great experience in Singapore and because of the impression of quiet and cosiness. Overall, it is a Mandarin, but nothing like what we have experienced elsewhere. Cleanliness and staff service are very high quality. Our room was upgraded, but it was nothing exceptional, so I wonder what a standard room is like. They have a very convenient dock for connecting to the audio-video system, and the bathroom is great. But there is limited space for storing luggage in the room, so it get crammed if you have more than two pieces. It is also surprising that in an international hotel chain, plugs are US standard only and they don't have the multi-system plugs... But the biggest deceptions are the following: 1 - The website indicates there's a private beach, well it's just some sand with long chairs. Don't think you can swim and enjoy a relaxing retreat.2 - Breakfast buffet is only cold cuts, cheese, fruits and cereals. It's a small, sad table compared to the extravaganza of other Mandarins. 3 - Internet is not complimentary, and it is quite expensive too, 15/day. All in all, we were so disappointed with our stay that we decided to cut it short and spend only one night there. The Mandarin is still an interesting hotel to stay at, perhaps with more realistic expectations you wouldn't be disappointed. This is a good hotel for business travelers, as it is very close to the financial district and there's not a grocery store around if you wanted to buy anything.",Neutral

"We wanted a hotel on the US side of the border but within close proximity of the airport in Tijuana--this hotel served that purpose well. We weren't expecting anything grand so we weren't disappointed in the typical hotel room and breakfast fare the next day. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable--all that we needed.However, we were told when making our reservation that it was an easy 2-block walk from the Otay Mesa border crossing. We arrived late at night and were NOT comfortable making the walk--nor was it a short 2 block jaunt. After walking more than 2 blocks with no hotel in sight, we stopped at a gas station and asked for directions. The attendant had never even heard off the hotel, much less could direct us to it. My cell phone wasn't getting any signal to be able to call the hotel directly but my husband's phone was, so we did get an updated set of directions (another couple of zigzag blocks to the west). I wouldn't advise doing this walk late at night but our return walk to the border the next morning was safe and easy.Bottom line Not the Ritz but a good place for a night or two.",Neutral

We had stayed at this hotel on previous visits and knew it was where we wanted to stay on this... More",Neutral
"Multiple delays and cancellations left us stuck partway home in Chicago...pulled out my phone with Marriott app and made a reservation right at the airline counter as lodging was becoming hard to find per the flight agents. We were welcomed to the hotel, got a clean room, ate dinner in the hotel lobby restaurant and were transported very early the following morning back to the airport, and finally home.Dear Astrid527,Thank you for taking the time to let us know how your recent stay was. We're glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and are safely back home. Wishing you safe travels and a happy holiday season!",Neutral
The door stuck and was extremely hard to open and close. The rug floor was dirty. Walking around in white socks got the bottoms of my feet dirty very quickly. Just rubbing a piece of paper on the floor picked up a lot of dirt. The pillows were very small smaller than a standard twin pillow ... strange. The water was extremely soft. I think they use too much water softening agents. You get that soapy feeling even after all the soap had been washed off. The breakfast was adequate. Front desk was very helpful. Nice courtyard area.Thank you Ron for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate the feedback and it is guests like you that help us to constantly improve our services. We hope you will come back again and give us the chance to exceed your expectations the next time you visit New Orleans.,Neutral
