"Nice, clean, modern rooms right next to Chinatown and easy walking distance to Union Square. Weve stayed in several San Francisco hotels and this is one of our favorites. Very courteous, helpful hotel staff.We're happy you're happy! Thanks for taking the time to leave a review. It's cool to hear you enjoyed everything from our staff to our walk-able neighborhood. Hope you stay with us again soon! Best, Pablo B. General Manager",Good
"This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The staff and facilities are very customer focussed and make you feel a valued guest. The extensive hot breakfast is brilliant with items being varied every day and even made to order omelets.

"My wife and I do extended road trips and always try to find good local restaurants that focus on food and not necessarily on presentation. We then go 'high end' for a few days (boutique hotels and fancier restaurants). This falls in between the two.The hotel is very nice and clean but the rooms are quite small (at least the standard rooms). Staff is attentive and polite but do not expect high end resort attentiveness. Parking is valet and your 26 dollars a night is basically a parking fee. You can take the trolley to the Garden District and walk the rest of the Quarter (4 blocks to Bourbon, 3 to Jackson Sq. another 3 to French Market). We got a King bed, 2 people for roughly 90 a night (mon-tues). Not bad from what I could tell on internet searches",Good
We made our reservations months ahead when we planned out our trip to Sea World. Pictures on the internet and real time were different. Rooms were very small with need of some upgrading. Beds were comfortable but there was some outdoor (construction) and road noise. A very short walk to several Excellent Restaurants and bay was really nice to walk around and enjoy all the boats.Nice plus is that you are about 15 minutes from Sea World with No freeway driving.Perhaps when the remodel project is done we will visit again.,Good
"The facilities are beautiful and comfortable. The bedding was wonderful. Lots of places to sit and relax. The ocean and beach were enjoyable. Did not use the pool. The gift shop offered a variety.

"I stay in a lot of hotels, especially for work, and I have to say, this was probably the best one overall, in terms of layout and provisions. My room was big (plenty of room for yoga). It had a large window, which had two blinds, one of which was blackout and in rails. This was amazing- it actually blocked the light out so I could sleep. It is actually very rare to find a hotel that has proper curtains or blinds that fully block the light out. The bed was comfy, and it had squishy feather/down pillows, which I love. The layout of the room was great- the fridge was under the sink not in the bedroom (great that there was a fridge) the shower space was large and actually had a shelf on which to put your bathroom products! Amazing! And amazingly useful! The shower space was large enough that you could turn it on and not get wet, and your shower products were not in the water, either. The room had a big TV on the wall opposite the bed, which had lots of pillows cushions to sit up on watch TV. The desk was a useful size, and had a plug hub (both electricity USB) (yay!). My only two gripes about the room were that there was no top sheet, which I find is far too common in Europe sometimes the USA, and I will never understand, because it can be too hot for a duvet and that there was only one towel hook in the bathroom, which would be awkward if you were two people. I did had to ask for more coat hangers, although that was no problem. I really liked that if you didn't get your room made-up, you got a voucher for the food/bar. That covered my brekky every morning! I did have some issue with noisy guests on my floor, but of course that's not the hotel's fault. The bar is pretty nice, with some very tasty drinks (pineapple chipotle margarita, anyone!) and a good atmosphere.",Good
"Manager was very nice. Bed was comfy, bathroom was big, and had a nice array of toiletries, a microwave and fridge. Very decent price and very quiet. Near all the attractions. Will definatly be staying here again when I visit CA.",Good
"Good breakfast. Responsive front desk. Comfortable rooms, especially the one bedroom. Excellent location. Lots of attractions and restaurants to go to, all within walking distance.

I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve.

This hotel is simple but clean and with charm. I like the room in the 4th floor. It is big and clean. The bathroom is quite enough and clean after a long stroll around the city. I feel that the bed is new and I saw too that they are delivering new bed mattress to the other rooms. The price I paid for the hotel is just enough for the expectations. Kinda just exact. I didn't have any negative vibes. The ladies staffs are great and helpful. I will come back on this hotel.,Good
"I enjoyed our stay here. The staff is accommodating and pleasant. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The sheets, pillows are luxe. We didn't even have to share an elevator ride. I was impressed with our stay. Didn't have to sign in to the wifi each day of our stay. It was the little things at the Conrad that made for a memorable visit in Chicago.Dear 6tribes, Thank you for your recent Conrad Chicago stay and taking time to write about your experience. I'm glad you were able to enjoy the little amenities and service perks that we offer to our guests to ensure that they have a comfortable stay. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back. Sincerely, Tod Chambers",Good
"I had a nice 5-night stay at this hotel. I was originally supposed to stay for 4 nights but my flight got cancelled and the hotel, graciously and without hassle or fanfare, allowed me to stay in my same room for an extra night and for the same nightly rate that I had booked when I was making my original reservation online. My room was located on the ground floor towards the back and the only disturbance was the restaurant next door late in the evenings. However, I'm not a light sleeper so once I went to bed, it didn't bother me at all. The legendary cat greeted me when I was checking in (around midnight) and he allowed me to pet him. I only saw him once more during my stay. This hotel is very well located - there are 2 cafes within 5 minutes walk and another 1 about 20 minutes' walk away - and there's a barbecue place right next door, a diner around the corner and a gourmet pizza place across the street. I sampled them all and was happy with my meals and coffee drinks. The hotel serves a continental breakfast. It's nothing to write home about but it will hold you for a few hours and I liked the convenience of not having to go in search of breakfast first thing in the morning. Ponce City Market is very nearby so there are a tonne more food options within easy reach. My room was well kept and very clean. It looks pretty dated but is very well maintained. My only problem was that the hot water took more than 15 minutes to really get hot and since I'm not a big fan of wasting water, I ended up taking tepid/warm showers most of the time, instead of really hot the way I like it. The staff were helpful when needed but not overly friendly. I had a good stay and I would return to this hotel if I needed to stay in that area again. Oh, and there's a Publix behind the hotel, about a 3 minute walk, which was very convenient when I needed cold medicine.",Good
"My daughter and I stayed at the Conrad for her 16th birthday. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us with a Michigan Avenue room with an awesome view. The location is just steps away from our favorite stores and many great restaurants. Thank you again to the wonderful staff at the Conrad!Dear 35johannaj, Happy 16th Birthday from the entire Conrad Chicago team! I'm so glad the team went out of their way to make you two comfortable during your visit with us. I appreciate you taking the time to write about your review. We look forward to having you stay with us again. Kind Regards, Tod Chambers",Good
Stayed here September 2018 for 7 nights hotel was amazing and should be rated a 5 star plus everything was perfect fantastic rooms amazing staff first class facilities great location close to all local attractions would highly recommend.Our team appreciates your review and recommendation on TripAdvisor. We are happy you enjoyed your visit to the resort and look forward to welcoming you back again in the near future.,Good
We got in around 7:00 pm and I was taken care of very quickly. Our rooms were close to each other as requested. Both rooms were very clean and nicely arranged. The fridge was already cold for our refreshments. We ended up playing cards outside in back until late and it was very peaceful.,Good
"Positives:- The room was absolutely spectacular. We loved the room that we were assigned. High ceilings, plenty of space, great decor. Historic photographs, views of the skyline. It was just awesome.- Nice locations near the Public Gardens and walkable to restaurants and attractions- The building felt historic and full of characterNegatives:- The parking situation was absolutely awful. Parking was only available at the Boston Common garage for a fee of 30-something a day, which isn't so bad, but the distance from the hotel is very far and in an underground garage. This really detracted from the overall experience and we wouldn't recommend it to others that have driven a car to the hotel. I would say stay at this hotel if you do not have a car with you.- Hotel staff were average, we did not feel welcomed by any of them.- The breakfast was poor - low quality food and some cheap automatic coffee maker",Good
"Stayed at Fairfield Inn And Suites Mothers Day Weekend 2017. We had finished a cruise in Miami and wanted to drive to the keys. Location was great for a one day drive to Keys. Our room wasn't ready but the manager gave us free shuttle to downtown. Beautiful pool but we didn't use it because we wanted to tour Key West. Shuttle took us right downtown. We explored Key West and had dinner. Enjoyed the sunset and took the shuttle back to the hotel. Recommend shuttle as there is no parking downtown. Great breakfast that was included. Easy checkout next day on our way home. Close to hwy so made it easy to get an early start on long drive home!Dear JaneA69,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Great Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and our Shuttle service to Mallory Square. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",Good
"We had a reservation cancelled at another hotel, and found this gem the same day we landed in NOLA for a conference. It was an easy walk to the Convention Center, and just a skip to the French Quarter. Plenty of excellent food within just a few blocks walk. The front desk was friendly and texted to check in daily. The bed were comfy, and the room quiet despite being right next to the hustle and bustle. The only down side was that breakfast was a little thin for my liking: AMAZING fresh croissants, jam, coffee and jam. Would definitely go back again!We're glad you decided to stay with us after your last-minute cancellation! It is good to hear you enjoyed the comfy beds, quiet room, friendly staff, and short walk from the hotel. Future breakfast expansion is something we are considering. Thanks for taking the time to leave a review! Your feedback is very much appreciated. We would definitely love to have you back again!Sincerely,Duriel HarrisGuest Relations ManagerSt. James Hotel(504) 304-4000",Good

"I was here all of 10 hours, and it was very, very good. I wasn't there long enough to test out everything. I was a little disappointed that the lobby bar closed at 10 on a Friday, but it didn't affect my overall good impression of the place. Oh, and great location!",Good
Spent several days at the Pearl for my daughter's wedding. Great service and very friendly people. It was a memorable time.,Good
"Ultra-modern hotel with a very friendly and efficient staff. Hotel was within easy walking district to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter. Fortunately, there were a number of restaurants nearby for breakfast (not included in price). Car parking was rather expensive at 40 per day.Sounds like we had everything you needed for your stay. See you again soon!",Good
"Hotel was clean. Check in was painless. Breakfast had a good variety and tasty.

"Convenient location off the interstate. I was in town for a Braves game----took an Uber to the game.Hotel was clean. It is connected to a Homewood Suites next door. This hotel doesn't have a pool / hot tub, but you can use the Homewood's next door.Thank you so much for your feedback! We are Atlanta's first Hilton Brand Dual Property. This gives our guests extra conveniences and amenities. Our pool and fitness areas are large enough to be shared by Homewood Suites and Hilton Garden Inn. Please come back to see us soon!

"The hotel was located just a few blocks from the Paramount Theater Convention Center and walkable to the downtown shopping area.Our room was large with a separate sitting area, desk, fridge and microwave. The hotel offers a very generous breakfast each morning that is included in the room price.It sits next to the freeway but we asked in advance for a room on the other side of the hotel.The staff was very friendly and accommodating.I'm thrilled you had a wonderful stay. There's nothing better than starting each day with a delicoius breakfast, so it's great you could take advantage of it. On top of that, I always love hearing the staff was friendly and accommodating. Thanks!Best,Frank F., General Manager",Good
"Homewood Suites at LBV is a very nice place to stay for a few nights. The suites offer a living area with a kitchenette, with a private bedroom and bathroom. Our room was clean and the bedding was very, very comfortable. The price is very reasonable. The staff was warm and friendly, and happy to assist. They were capable of answering my questions, and were very hospitable.",Good
A clean and well kept place with a friendly staff. Easy on off from I-77 Good breakfast close to restaurants and next door to a gas station. A better Quality Inn would surely stay again. Neal Ellen E,Good
"We only stayed here for one night as we transfer at the Atlanta airport. Hotel is a short drive from the airport and offers free shuttle. Service is great - my wife somehow didn't feel well (due to allergies) in the first room they offered us, and the staff was kind enough to arrange the presidential suite as an exchange since they were fully booked that night. Comfortable bed and quality sleep.",Good

We look forward to welcoming you back soon!",Good
"We went to the Springhill Suites for our grand niece, who was starting San Diego State. When we walked in the lobby they had a counter for the Springhill Suites and next to it the Residence Inn. The place is beautifully decorated, reasonable and the service was fantastic. The rooms are large and we had a wonderful view of the city skyline. Breakfast was also a shared dining room with so many options of food it was impossible to go hungry. The food quality was very good.",Good

"I say it's the real deal because the place lives up to the positive reviews I read before staying here about two weeks ago. I travel to Miami about 6 to 8 times a year to visit family and I feel like I'm becoming an expert on where to stay for what. Technically, you could stay at this hotel and never leave the immediate area, and be okay. The place is clean, new, well kept, relaxing, with a friendly staff. The bathroom is pretty excellent and the room I was in felt enormous. (bathrobes included btw) The pool looked great, but it rained when I was there. I also saw a lot of space to lounge around outside if the weather permitted. Because of the design, architecture and foliage, when you're in the motel, you feel like you're in a private spot. You can't really see out which is nice. This helps create an atmosphere. If you venture outside the grounds, there's plenty of small restaurants within walking distance: the place is on a block with at least 5 restaurants to the south. To the north, things are waiting to be updated including 2 other motels. I think when they are done, this area will really come alive.I parked for free, which is hard to find in Miami. The neighborhood was safe, so I ordered from a few restaurants online and walked to pick up food. They were working on an onsite diner which I think would complete the whole experience when done. Location-wise, it's subjective. It's kind of off the beaten path in terms of South Beach or Downtown, but I liked being on Biscayne Blvd. And with a car, I could drive right up to the Aventura mall and the Gulfstream Casino, but I also wasn't too far to get to family in Miami Beach. Where it is on Biscayne makes it relatively easy to get around and you skip a lot of the freeway traffic. I'll definitely keep my eye on this place. I'd love to stay again when the diner is done and the weather permits for some poolside bar time. I'm also curious how this area will develop in the next few years.Thank you so much for such a lovely review and we do hope you return soon. The restaurant should re-open in early October as upscale Sushi so hopefully you can plan your next trip in the fall. The area has certainly changed since we totally renovated the hotel back in 2014, with only a few more buildings still in need of renovations. Stay tuned as the neighborhood continues to change!",Good
"Superbly wonderful property. Nearly spotless and impeccable grounds. Everything works, no issues. Soft beds, plenty of shower room, Internet is quick. Located just up from the downtown area. Very quiet rooms, right on the main road.",Good
"Can't be much closer to the ocean, listening to the waves as you sleep. Price is right, clean rooms with great parking. Only real flaw, new carpeting is needed. When booking request the quiet side or next time we would preferably book the rooms right on the boardwalk, worth the extra money. Great location for a lot less cost. Patrick was very friendly when we checked in. Went the extra for making our stay as great as possible.We are one of the few properties in San Diego that gives guests the ability to listen to the ocean waves from their rooms! Many guests also report seeing dolphins from their balconies. Were happy you could enjoy this.Also, the next time you stay with us every room on the property will have new carpet! This process is currently underway and will conclude by the end of February.Thank you for the kind words about our staff, your compliments will be passed along. Thanks for staying with us!",Good
"This hotel is just off I 5 and a great location for visiting San Diego. At first glance we weren't sure it was a perfect fit for us, surrounding area seemed a little less than desirable, building seemed old, but Jesse at front desk was very kind and helpful. The rooms actually were very nice, very clean (my most important item) and laid out very well.Breakfast was really good, great variety, and the lady who ran the breakfast was wonderful. Very helpful and kind (helping a lady with her small children)Good Afternoon, Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property, and thank you for your compliments to the hotel and staff.

"The hotel is 2miles from the airport, and as as stop over hotel it is excellent. There are 6 floors and we were give a harbour view room. The room was very clean, spacious with a small balcony that you could sit out on and watch the activity in the harbour. When we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful, and there were free freshly cooked cookies and coffee in the foyer . There were 2 restaurants virtually opposite the hotel, however, they were pricey, probably due to their location. There were several cheap and cheerful restaurants that were within a very short distance at the back of the hotel, which we walked to. The only downside is it was quite noisy from the road. On our last night there were road repairs going on all night, which were particularly noisy as they were using a pneumatic drill. Overall This is a good hotel to stay at for your stay in San Diego.",Good
"I stayed at Ocean Park Inn in 2008 and 2009. I walked up and down the boardwalk and I don't feel there is a better place to stay. I was on the 3rd floor with an ocean view each time. It is breathtaking at sunset.The hotel was in the process of upgrades during my last stay. My room had not been updated yet - it was in dire need of new bedding I will admit. The bed was quite uncomfortable. The TV was out dated - they were replacing them with wall mounted flat screens however. They were also painting all of the hallways - I see someone mentioned the hallways were not air conditioned - I don't spend time in the hallway, so I don't see why this would matter - I never noticed the hallways being uncomfortable.I used the pool area quite a bit to tan, and was usually the only one there. Pool area is great.I have read some reviews stating that the management and staff were rude, that the area is noisy, and there are people hanging around the hotel. I had absolutely no problems with any of the staff on either of my stays. Each one was consistently helpful, courteous - almost to a fault!, and friendly. Jay, Chanel, Patrick, Sachin and Karelia - made my stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel is on the Pacific Beach boardwalk - there is noise. There are people on the boardwalk, rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, walking and jogging from early morning to evening. The beach is also immediately off the boardwalk - what do people expect! For there to be no one on the beach and no one on the boardwalk If you want quiet and solitude, stay on an island. It's Pacific Beach, it's a beach community - it is what it is. I never found the noise to be over-whelming and slept with my slider open every nite.Yes, there are a number of homeless that stay directly in front of the hotel on the boardwalk - they keep to themselves and don't bother anyone. I never saw them approach anyone at any time. They are gone by early evening. Traveling alone, I never felt afraid to be near them at any time-in fact I talked to some of them. They are harmless. T The continental breakfast changed last year and didn't offer as much as it did the year before (there were waffle makers the year before). However, there were several varieties of fresh bagels, packaged pastries, toast, butter, jelly's, cream cheese, fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, juice and milk. Just like any other continental breakfast FOR FREE. I'm just not sure what people expect. It was quite adequate. I would rather not have a full breakfast offered in lieu of keeping costs down.Again, having walked up and down the boardwalk, there are some really trashy places to stay - including the Best Western that are old, outdated, filthy and run down. Yes, there are a few nicer places like Tower 23 but the cost is also considerably higher. For the money, location, rooms and staff, I can't think of a better place to stay while in Pacific Beach or the San Diego area.",Good

This place is legit. It's definitely not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton but whenever you book this hotel the rate will likely be much lower than most others. If you're coming to the city to hang out in the hotel room then don't stay here....if you need a clean and safe place to sleep and cleanup at then this is the place for you. Free parking and an unbeatable location.Definitely get a room in the back of the hotel. Rooms are small but not claustrophobic. 15 min walk to Union Square. Located by several fantastic shops and restaurants.,Good
From when I checked in and met Stephen until I was eating the great breakfast I enjoyed my stay here. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. I enjoyed the smoking room. What a concept these days. Thank you for an awesome experience.,Good
"This is one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in. We arrived the day before our cruise, and check-in went very smoothly. We shared a room with our daughter and son-in-law, a very spacious room with two queen beds in a separate room, plus a comfortable to sleep on sofa. It had a little kitchenette with a fridge and microwave. Although we didn't use that feature, it would be handy to have if we'd have been staying longer than overnight. The hotel has great technology, lighting controlled with your room card as soon as you enter the room, a great TV in both rooms, and a very nice kitchen island to sit at and eat our awesome cheesecake we got to bring back for a snack. The front desk obtained great transportation for us to the pier the next morning, at a very nominal cost of 10/pp. This hotel is located within walking distance of places to visit, the Space Needle (right across the street!), the Chihuly Museum and garden, and many places to eat close by. Free breakfast was included in our stay the food was varied, plentiful, and excellent quality. We also booked a room for the following Friday when we arrived back in Seattle from our cruise, and stayed that night to go sightseeing during the day. Same great lodging, although a smaller room since it was just for two, and arranged transport again to the airport. We were too early to check in on that day, so they stored our luggage for us, and then texted us when our rooms were ready. We would definitely stay here again!",Good

"This hotel is clean, and reasonable, conveniently located close to downtown, harbor island, airport, and other attractions. It looked like a renovated, upscale motel, and there was a little noise while they were cleaning mid day, but otherwise, good experience and reasonably priced. Avalon at the front desk was especially helpful and informative they also give you complementary coffee and check in/out was easy. I would consider staying here again, unless price and views elsewhere were more appealing. Parking was also easy, free residential available not far from the hotel.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, thank you for your kind review. We appreciate your support.

"We stayed at Hotel Diva for three nights on our first trip to San Fransico. When we were headed to our room in the elevator a guest made a comment that the rooms were small so we were expecting that when we opened the door, but were pleasantly suprised. The room we had was quite a reasonable size with king bed, small dining table and office desk as well as enough space to have our two large suitcases open on the floor. The bathroom was however one of the smallest I have seen although fine for a few nights stay. The rooms felt clean and the bed was comfortable. Decor felt a little dull due to all the silver and grey, not a lot of colour. Located only a short walk, 2 blocks to Union Square. First time visitors I would recommend this hotel for your holiday, and would certainly consider returning here. Staff were knowledgable and helpful.Dear KJWAust,Thank you for your feedback.

"We enjoyed this lovely hotel. It was nice to go to breakfast and look up and see the beautiful architectural details. The bank vault of course was extraordinary. We learned that the hotel is still attached to a working bank. The restaurant was lovely and the bacon egg and cheese croissant was fresh and delicious. The room was nice enough and clean enough. We would definitely stay here again for a quick stay.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!

"This hotel is currently undergoing renovations... So there is construction going on during the day. But it stops at 5:30 pm, so it didn't effect us a bit!

This is an older hotel but far from beyond it's prime! They have done a fine job of keeping it updated. I love the way the rooms all open up to the main open area. The brick mosaics on the outside of the building are unlike anything I have ever seen. I loved the steam room and fitness area. The showers and little lounge area near the gym are wonderful. I almost stayed down there and left my poor husband in the room with two crazy kids! It was very quite even though there were many gatherings going on this weekend. The only problem we had was the jerk who had the room before us set the alarm for midnight and it shocked us awake. It took about an hour to get back to sleep. Just plain rude!Thank you for the deailed notes on your recent visit with us. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and had a chance to go to our fitness cente. I hope you were able to squeeze in enough time to visit our spa too I will share your experience with the alarm clock with my team to ensure we are double checking clocks when we clean the rooms. Sees like we could have caught that for you. Hope to see you back at the Waverly soon!,Good
"I was in town for an HR conference in June. This hotel is on Bourbon street on the corner of Bourbon and Toulouse - right in the heart of the French Quarter and within walking distance to everywhere - Jackson square, cafe du mond, excellent restaurants (check out my other reviews) and shopping.The rooms are fine, nothing fancy (the shower head was coming out of the wall, the bathroom is small, the carpet is worn and i think there was something wrong with the AC in my room 215 - no matter how high i turned it up it still felt like 65 degrees, so i called housekeeping and asked for a blanket. The bed is incredibly comfortable, and my room had a balcony with a view to the pool and the inner courtyard - fabulous!I want to send a shout out to two of the staff members - Allen, the bell captain who is friendly, knowledgeable,and incredibly helpful (ask him for recommendation for anything, he won't disappoint) and Bella, who saw me walk out of my room on a rainy day outside and immediately offered me a rain coat... I have never met so many nice people! I will be back.Thank you loves2travel2011 for sharing your experience with us. Please accept our apology for the inconvenience you experienced with the a/c and shower head. We have informed the appropriate hotel team to look into the issues and correct them moving forward. With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations. We will share your feedback with Allen and Bella. Thank you for staying at the Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter and we hope you choose to stay with us again whenever your travel needs bring you back to New Orleans.",Good
"The hotel proximity was close to the Zoo and to the USS Midway which we were visiting. Downtown is a little exciting to maneuver around one-way streets but GPS helps. We arrived after sunset so it was difficult to find the entrance to their parking structure. It didn't help that a tour bus was blocking our view of the driveway. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was tidy.Thank you for staying with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn. We are pleased that our proximity to the Zoo and Midway was convenient.

"Abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti durante il nostro viaggio di nozze. Siamo stati un po' sfortunati sia per la camera, solo al secondo piano e vista strada sia per il fatto che dei lavori, indipendenti dall'hotel, hanno comportato l'interruzione della corrente per quasi tutta una notte. Nonostante questo il personale stato efficiente e disponibile offrendoci torce ed avvisando tutti con l'interfono in stanza di quando ci sarebbe stata l'interruzione. La stanza era grande e pulita, l'aria condizionata molto funzionale e finalmente silenziosa. Maggiore rispetto ad altri hotel la disponibilit di prodotti da bagno. Disponibilit di un grande frigorifero e di un forno a microonde. Ottimo il sonno, non si sentiva un rumore. La colazione era la classica continentale, buona ma migliorabile con pi scelte. Il parcheggio dell'hotel comodissimo e costa solo (non vi dico i prezzi che ho trovato a Chicago, Los Angeles o San Francisco) 14 a notte e noi l'abbiamo sfruttato a pieno. Abbiamo anche potuto usare un PC per gli ospiti. WiFi gratis e piuttosto veloce. Ottima la posizione centrale. Insomma difficile chiedere di pi.

"Having only stayed at some of the larger hotels in New Orleans, we decided to try a smaller boutique hotel this time. We had booked a fourth floor sundeck room and I'm very happy we did. The weather was lovely all week and we really made good use of the sundeck. We had a table and chairs and there were lots of beautiful plants all over the deck. Upon arrival at 2:00, our room was not ready. We were told they would call us when it was ready, but by 5:00, still no call. We didn't mind the wait as we just strolled around the French Quarter while we waited. We decided to go back and check on the room and it was ready once we got there. The room as a nice size, especially considering how small some of them can be in the FQ. The room was very clean, although in need of some refurbishment. It is an old building though. The carpet was very stained, but it did seem to get vacuumed every day. We did have a problem with not getting enough towels. There were 3 of us and we only received 2 bath towels, so we had to consistently ask for more towels each day. Other than that, no problems with housekeeping. The room was relatively quiet, facing the river side of the building. We did hear the occasional horn of a passing train, which in the middle of the night, was a bit loud. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. The free continental breakfast was okay, but nothing special. The beds were a bit soft for my liking and rather small.Overall, a very nice experience.",Good

"So, it was 7:30a, we just debarked our cruise and our flight didn't leave until 11p. We are a family of four: two adults/two kids, so naturally I wanted to be somewhere where my husband and I could relax and the kids could splash around in the pool ..or something.We called around to other hotels and were given ridiculous day rates. We happened upon the Sheraton and gave them a call. They were incredibly accommodating and the price for the room was unbelievably reasonable. Check in was smooth, the hotel was very clean and the room was spacious and delightful. The heated pool actually felt heated and the hot tub was relaxing. If you have a day in Orlando and you just want to relax..Stay Here!!!We were thrilled to hear that we were able to accommodate your needs and that you enjoyed your day at the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport! We strive in making every guests stay a memorable one and were happy to hear of your experience. We would love to see you and your family again soon!",Good
"This is one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in. We arrived the day before our cruise, and check-in went very smoothly. We shared a room with our daughter and son-in-law, a very spacious room with two queen beds in a separate room, plus a comfortable to sleep on sofa. It had a little kitchenette with a fridge and microwave. Although we didn't use that feature, it would be handy to have if we'd have been staying longer than overnight. The hotel has great technology, lighting controlled with your room card as soon as you enter the room, a great TV in both rooms, and a very nice kitchen island to sit at and eat our awesome cheesecake we got to bring back for a snack. The front desk obtained great transportation for us to the pier the next morning, at a very nominal cost of 10/pp. This hotel is located within walking distance of places to visit, the Space Needle (right across the street!), the Chihuly Museum and garden, and many places to eat close by. Free breakfast was included in our stay the food was varied, plentiful, and excellent quality. We also booked a room for the following Friday when we arrived back in Seattle from our cruise, and stayed that night to go sightseeing during the day. Same great lodging, although a smaller room since it was just for two, and arranged transport again to the airport. We were too early to check in on that day, so they stored our luggage for us, and then texted us when our rooms were ready. We would definitely stay here again!",Good

lovely boutique hotel in the perfect spot. Room was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was outstanding. We arrived 3 hours ahead of checkin time thinking we would ask if we could leave our bags in the lobby and go have lunch. We were checked in on the spot in minutes. We selected a King deluxe room and we were on the ground floor opening to the terrace. It was peaceful and quiet enough for an afternoon nap and yet located in a great spot in the French Quarter. We would go back in a heartbeat.,Good

"We stayed here for six nights in December. The porters on arrival were excellent. We arrived with a rental car and the porter told us exactly where to take the car to return it and took care of the luggage straight away.We wanted to see the ocean from the room so booked an ocean-view room. We were allocated an ocean view room in the Pacific Tower. I knew from the reviews that the partial ocean view rooms only had a view from the balcony, but I thought that if we paid the extra for the ocean view we would see the ocean. This is not the case. So I have no idea what the difference is between partial ocean view and ocean view except the price.So on arrival into our ocean view room, I wasn't happy, so I called the desk and was told I would need to upgrade to an ocean front room if I want to see the ocean from the room. So we paid the extra and upgraded. We were allocated room 619 of the Ocean Tower. The view from the ocean front room was beautiful as you would expect. Great view of the gorgeous sunsets and we left the doors open of a night to hear the ocean which was really nice. Unfortunately every morning at around 4am a couple of people (possibly staff) decided to have a loud conversation on the beachfront right below our room.The rooms in the hotel are very nice, in excellent condition, with good sized bathrooms (shower is over the bath), in a good location.The lobby is lovely, the staff are friendly. Our room wasn't serviced on one of the days, so I called the front desk and they sent someone to service the room.The pool was absolutely freezing. I was really looking forward to having a swim, but it was just too cold. However there is a very hot spa pool. The pool service is good, with staff offering bar service.The restaurants in the hotel were good. I have reviewed them separately.",Good

"Fantastic hotel with great rooms! Service was good, rooms were clean. The only downside - our room was overlooking the rooftop of a local nightclub so we fell asleep listening to the loud bass from the music. Otherwise great place and would go back again.Dear Mtxstarr,Glad you joined us, although I apologize for the lively neighborhood! There's not too many challenges that arise from a city with such amazing weather, but one of them is that a lot of the bars and restaurants in the Gaslamp are outdoor. That can lead to some issues with noise from time to time! One great room tip ask for a higher room overlooking the East Village (also known as the Ballpark District). There's less noise emanating from the local clubs there. Hope that helps and please come see us again.RobertGeneral ManagerHotel Solamar - a very Kimpton Hotel",Good
"This hotel is charming, quaint and has all the comforts of home. The pool area is so exquisite. The location could not be more perfect, within walking distance of everything, but just far enough away from the noise. We stayed there just before Christmas and the lobby, although small had such a cozy feel and the hot chocolate served in the late afternoon was a real treat. Breakfast was however limited in selection. All the staff were extremely helfpful. The parking is extra and is expensive, but all hotels in big cities charge addtional due to space limitation, add it into you budget. We do however wish that they had two queen beds instead of two fulls which is just too small to share other than that we give the Bienville House an A+",Good

"Apparently the parking lot is locked at 7 PM. You would not know this unless it was locked and you were looking at the sign on the locked gate. I had an early AM (5:30) checkout after a one night stay for an early flight. The desk clerk did not tell me the gate was locked. As I was loading the luggage in the car, the security guard walked by and did not tell me the gate was locked. When I got to the gate, I found it locked and had to run around the hotel as I had no key to get in the back and then had to wait for the security guard to drive over to unlock the gate.",Good

"So my fiance and I have stayed at a lot of hotels and motels around the Disneyland property, and this one is probably the one we will be staying at the next time we visit Disneyland. Here's some items to put into consideration. 1. Location. Del Sol Inn is located right off Harbor Dr, behind Denny's, and a very short walk to the park. We've stayed at other hotels where walking to the park and back is anywhere from 15-25 minutes, on top of being in the parks all day. This place has a great location!2. Price. The closer you are located to the park, the more expensive it gets. I feel like the Del Sol Inn is the exception to this rule. They are very close to the park but very accommodating for the the price. If you are a AAA member, Active Military Member, or a Disneyland Passholder, they also offer discounts. 3. Parking/Valet. So what parking is small. There's a reason why valet is there. When I arrived there wasn't any parking spaces available but valet was able to accommodate and park my car while I enjoyed my vacation. We didn't use the car until the end of the vacation, but I didn't have to worry about it either. Additionally, my car wouldn't start when we were leaving, but valet was kind enough to take the time to jump-start my car. Very grateful and appreciative. 4. Rooms. Rooms were very clean and spacious. We stayed in the Deluxe King room and my fiance and I will probably request this room again. We do not have kids, so it was nice to stay in a spacious King room with a King bed. Bed was comfortable, I would suggest bringing your own pillows. Heater/AC/Fan worked great. Refrigerator worked great. A safe is available too.5. Breakfast/Pool/Internet. We did not check out breakfast because there are other locations offered for eating breakfast. However if you are into it this location offers a free continental breakfast. Pool and hot tub were very nice and very inviting. I did not use the internet/wi-fi but it is available. 6. Staff. Once again valet was great, and the hotel staff were also awesome. They offered locations and places to check out and to eat (Including one Chinese Restaurant that was fantastic-Great China), as well as offering a location to service my car that needed a new battery. Staff were friendly and super nice. 7. Water pressure. Surprisingly the water pressure here was not too bad. I've had worse at other locations (Carousel Inn, Castle Inn/Suites, Holiday Inn, and even Disneyland Hotel). I would rate it medium. 8. Other things to consider: Yes this is not a super deluxe hotel. It is closer to a motel than anything. You will hear noises and people pass by your room in the morning. Most hotels in Anaheim are going to be like this (Including the luxurious Disneyland Hotel Resort). This is an older motel, but most hotels and motels are going to have the same features. If you are looking for something super nice and expensive, you may want check out the Disneyland Hotels or go down the road. This place is great for sleeping, showering, and relaxing. Want to have a reasonably-priced motel with a great location, this place is for you.",Good

The rooms were very modern and clean. Good amount of space and great amenities. Hotel is conveniently located within blocks of Pike Place, restaurants, and shopping. I prefer to not stay too close to Pike Place because of the crowds. Starbucks is located right across the street, which is great if you need coffee every morning.

But we did have a few drinks and the staff is very hospitable. If the weather had been cooler we would have sat outside.The hotel was very clean and our room was nice the only thing I didn't like was there was no counter in the bathroom but this could have been because our room seemed to be handicap accessible, perhaps that was error in the reservation not sure.Overall it was fun staff was nice, hotel was clean, and we had a good trip.Thank you, Tyler W, for choosing the River Hotel and posting your review.

"My husband, and I just visited San Francisco last weekend. We stayed two nights at The Orchard Garden Hotel, and we were very pleased with our stay. The hotel was clean, roomy, comphy beds, and the staff was very friendly, and very helpful directing us to different locations.

"Hotel Was Exemplary - apart from the food options The food really lets your hotel down - the choices variety were appalling - doughnuts for breakfast Burgers Pizzas for dinner - there needs to be more varietyGene P,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"This property is extremely close to all the Disney Parks and main Marriott hotel (on property). Location, Location, Location. The overall property is very good and the staff is outstanding. Unfortunately our initial experience was very rough but the property management took accountability, immediately fixed the issues and followed up repeatedly to ensure our satisfaction. My family checked into the three bedroom villa on December 26th for seven days at Disney World. The overall layout of the room is excelled and we enjoyed the screened in porch overlooking the golf course and pond (ducks included). Upon arriving, the villa floors were filthy, carpets stained and bar stools worn to threadbare state. We've stayed at many Marriott Vacation Club properties over the years and experienced beautiful, clean and new(er) villas. The cleanliness of our villa was out of the ordinary. I called the GM, Eugene, and he immediately brought his staff to our villa to assess the situation and offer apologies. He committed to having all fixed by the time we returned from Magic Kingdom later that day. Eugene and team came through with grace and excellence. The room was deep cleaned, carpets shampooed and furniture replaced with brand new pieces. The Vacation Club staff treated me and my family like Diamond status owners the rest of the week. Eugene and his team turned a situation into an experience we will never forget. Well done!Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced upon arrival but it is great to hear Eugene and staff were able to resolve the issue swiftly and to your satisfaction. We hope you will join us again sometime soon.",Good

"My husband and I and our infant and child stayed here to break up a trip while driving home to Florida from Missouri.Room:Cleanliness- the room was overall clean and felt fresh.The bathroom was clean but I noticed a small human body hair on the neatly folded washcloths. I prayed it was a beard hair. The tub seemed a little worn and I didn't want to bathe my infant in it. The shower was extra hot and enjoyable. The beds are by far the best I've slept in. If you've ever enjoyed a Marriott bed you know what I'm talking about!There were ample pillows and the linens were nice. I'm not certain on the detergent used but it made my son and I break out on our faces.I felt the bathrooms could be updated. I stayed at a Marriott in Winnipeg and loved the design. These bathrooms felt cheap. The vinyl feeling walls were cracked and chipped and bubbled and the paint was off. I felt they only provided bare minimum toiletries. Parking was easy for us, which was a plus.The staff was very very kind! I felt welcomed.The breakfast was really good and left me wanting hot oatmeal with all the toppings each morning after I left! Delicious spread! I would recommend some sort of iced tea or cold offering other than juice.Other than the sub par bathroom, I liked this Fairfield. The woman who checked us out was a Denver Broncos fan like us and was SO friendly.

"After returning from Chicago and a stay at the Hotel Allegro, celebrating my partner's birthday, I can't say enough good things about the hotel. While our check-in was a little rocky with a staff member who was a bit terse ( though solely trying to deal with what seemed to be a security issue), overall our stay was great. Staff even had candies, nuts and beer in the room, with a hand-written card waiting for us in our room, as a birthday gift for my husband. The hotel has recently been updated but stays true to its Theater district roots. Modern Art Deco design adorns throughout, while still giving this hotel an old world classy feeling. However, note standard rooms are smaller than the average sizes today, though you will have just enough space to not feel cramp.",Good

"Stayed here with my husband who attended a meeting and this is where they booked him a room and had the meeting. From the beginning with the doormen being very attentive, to the house cleaning staff being super friendly, to the clean tastefully decorated rooms, our stay was relaxing. We were upgraded to one of the Imperial floors which has a lounge that offers a continental breakfast and evening hor dourves/drinks. This was nice as it was easy to grab a bite to eat/drink. The rooms were clean and modern- had a separate tub and shower. There was a screen on the mirror in the bathroom that had it's own remote but we never were able to figure out how to work it (there were no obvious instructions). Wifi was free and the basic was adequate, although you could upgrade to faster speeds if needed for a fee. The gym/pool was an extra 25 for the length of the stay and we did not partake and chose to exercise outside instead. Nice location- only 1-2 blocks from the Powell Street BART station, in walking distance to Chinatown, the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf. The end of the line for the cable cars is not far either. I would highly recommend this hotel and would likely stay here again.Dear Grch,Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review about your most recent stay with us. It is wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your time at our property, and that you were even able to be upgraded to one of our Imperial Floor rooms! I do apologize that there were no clear instructions as to how the built-in T.V. worked in the bathroom. We are always looking for ways to improve the guest experience, so I will absolutely be sharing your comments with our management team to see if there is anything we can do to make our features more user friendly.Again, thank you for taking the time to share your experience, and we very much look forward to having you stay with us again.Thank you,Dani OrtegaMarketing Manager",Good

"Stayed at the SeaWorld Hampton for two nights on a recent trip to Florida. The hotel came exactly as advertised, we are familiar with the Hampton Brand, and I can thoroughly recommend this hotel as an excellent place to stay.Location is excellent, SeaWorld is an easy walk, Aquatica was a bit further but still only 25 mins for us as a family..and saved on shuttle times.Perks are as you would expect...quick queue being the best of all of them.Rooms were more than adequate...although my only surprise was there being no in room safe in ours (thought that would be a given in a tourist location).The best reason to stay at this hotel though was the staff. I cannot compliment them enough on their friendliness and readiness to help...from check in to check out, from suggesting places to eat and being kind to my son. We as a family appreciate when people are kind and polite to us, especially when the staff are dealing with 100s of people a day. First class...and enough of a reason for us to stay at this hotel again.Recommended by us for location and friendliness..and for what you would expect from a GOOD Hampton",Good
"I have stayed at this property before. It continue to be well-maintained. The room was spacious and comfortable. The room is far enough from the main street that traffic noise isn't a factor. The breakfast is very complete - biscuits, gravy, eggs, sausage, cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, pastries, instant cereals. It's a nice place.",Good
Hotel is close to most things you need to see in San Fran. Close to Union Square and the cable cars and trams. Hotel staff are friendly and help with all the touristy things. Rooms are a nice size and are clean and comfortable. There was a little noise from the street below....but you are in the middle of the city so you can expect that. I booked my room through booking.com and 2 days after checking in found that the hotel had over charged me by over 300.00 - but as it turns out the hotel adds a nice big fat amount for incidentals.............and refund the amount if you don't use them or haven't trashed the room lol. Apart from that I would stay there again without hesitation.,Good

They have a nice courtyard next to the pool.Breakfast was fine.They have China mugs and metal cutlery, which makes a pleasant change.There is a parking charge of 20 a night, ouch! We stayed 3 nights.We would use this hotel again.",Good
Lovely place with its own style .... Appreciate that it is not trying to copy the general boutique hotel style that is available everywhere these days. Feels like it belongs in San Antonio. Not trying to be LA our Miami etc etc,Good
"We only stayed at this hotel for 1 night, but it was definitely worth it. First of all, all hotels in NYC are ridiculously expensive, so be prepared to shell out at least 200-250 for this hotel, and it will be one of the cheapest finds. It is perfectly situated about 3 blocks from times squre, so you are close to the action, but can get a good night's sleep. The front desk was very nice and helpful. They gave us a map, and showed us where we were located, and explained how the subway system worked. We arrived earlier than the checkin time, and our room was ready which was GREAT. For check out, our train was departing at 11:00 p.m., and they were nice enough to store our luggage while we toured the city. We had to print out our Broadway tickets from Ticketmaster, and it only took 3 minutes in the business center, where the internet and print outs were free.I would definitely stay again in this hotel.Dear Mariana L,Thank you so much for the great review and we hope you had a terrific time here in NYC! Its great to see you enjoyed our location and amenities. We really hope this experience encouraged you to stay with us again in the future as we look forward to your return. Thanks again for the kind feedback and we wish you the best in your travels!Sincerely,Team Holiday Inn Express Times Square",Good
"My wife and I are active travelers who view a hotel as only a place to sleep and have breakfast so we can spend the time touring. We got the room with Marriott points, but would have otherwise spent the 269 for this prime location. It is away from the craziness of the Pike's place wharf but 10min from downtown on the trolley (1 per day for seniors) Seattle Rapid Transit is light years ahead of the rest of the U.S. --safe, clean, wheelchair access, and ON TIME!Although on points, hotel management quickly moved us to another room when we asked for a little less road noise. The in-house Starbucks Coffee was a plus. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. The desk staff were extremely tourist friendly readily giving tips and directions. Three budget eateries are a block away, but the staff knows the better dining venues as well. Just walking along Lake Union is a treat with the float planes, marinas and swimmers.This hotel will be our retreat whenever we visit Seattle in the future.Dear Douglas D,Thank you for your comments. We are very fortunate to have so many great reviews here on TripAdvisor and I greatly appreciate you adding your experience. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the location of our hotel and the nearby eateries and attractions.

"As has been written in other reviews the higher bayside rooms do have a great view past the other buildings nearby. The location is good, within easy walking distance of the Star Princess and Midway museums, embarcardero and Little Italy. A cheap cab ride to downtown and the gaslight quarter. Our room was always clean, the beds were fine and the breakfast next door was on a par with most other hotels. I agree with other reviews that some of the desk staff are a bit surly. The Italian opposite the hotel is worth a visit if you want to eat locally. Remember to budget for the 14 a night parking feeThis is not a hotel to get excited about, but offers good value in a good location.Dear tedreg,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego. We are please you felt the view of the bay from the rooms is great. We hope you will accept our sincere apologies for our front desk staff not exceeding your expectations, your feedback will help guide our training efforts.

"My husband and I recently visited San Fransico and stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel. Through online reviews and proximity within the city, we selected the Galleria---and they lived up to the high reviews! It is a beautiful, clean boutique hotel that is close to everything. We never needed a car and it was a pleasure to come back to just hang out in the room. The bed was comfortable, the sheets soft, nice furnished room and frankly it was a cool historic building the old Sutter Hotel. They even offer a really cool afternoon wine get together in the lobby. The best part however, is the staff. They were so warm, friendly and incredibly helpful. Whatever we needed or asked, they addressed with a smile and immediately took care of. Some of the best customer service I've seen in a while--and my family travels often. If go back to San Fransico, I will be making my reservation again at the Galleria. It was a wonderful experience.",Good
Going to the Dallas/Arlington area This hotel is the perfect choice. The rooms are clean and quiet and the beds are just right. The location is perfect...less than 10 minutes from Dealey Plaza and less than 20 minutes to Arlington (home of the Rangers Cowboys). The hotel staff is the most pleasant and helpful of any the I have ever seen. You can't go wrong staying here!!,Good

"This unique old Victorian hotel is amazing. The no frills way of staying. No TV, small rooms, just FAB. Fresh coffee and tea every morning. Access to their computer and free wifi. The showers and toilets are VERY clean and warm towels are provided. It can get noisy on trash day, since there is an alley on one side. But overall what great experience. My new home away from home.",Good
This was an amazing place to stay the people were so friendly and upon my arrival I was offered a suite instead of the room that I had reservations for and they did not charge me extra for the better room. They were very helpful with directions and everything. Definitely a great place to stay if you are visiting Atlanta and within walking distance of many great places.,Good
"The location was excellent for us as we were visiting a friend at a nearby hospital. Check-in was quick, it was very clean and well maintained and the staff was helpful. There is easy on-off of Central Expressway. A full kitchen is available stocked with dishes, pots, pans, etc. A nice touch was the microwave popcorn. Breakfast was good and as expected. Staff was available for help there too. Overall a good choice for an overnight stay. The price was reasonable.",Good
"This place is a fantastic deal. It seems like the common areas have recently been renovated. The staff was absolutely wonderful and the amenities are pretty good. There is a hot tub, heated pool, fitness center, and continental breakfast. The breakfast was pretty standard, nothing special. My only complaint about this place is the cramped parking lot with no elevators. Otherwise my family and I truly enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable here. I would definitely recommend it!",Good
"I stayed at the JW Marriott for 2 nights for a conference held inside the hotel. Everything from security, air comfort, to the food and drink was A+. I want to make a special shout out to the security lady, wish I would have written down her name, who as a matter of walking through the hall asked me how my stay was going. I had a minor issue with the climate control in my room and told her about it. She was amazing. She had the issue solved within the hour, saw me later in the hotel and asked if I was satisfied. WOW.I have another worthy shout out to the server in the lobby lounge that expertly attended to my party of 5 travel weary guests. Her smile never wavered and I can assure you that we weren't an easy bunch that evening simply because we were hungry and tired. The lobby is beautifully appointed in such a way that I actually sighed with relief when I got there. And lastly, i love love love the fact that this hotel is directly across the street from the Lenox Street Marta stop making my dash to and from the airport an absolute breeze.Thank you for your glowing review. I will be sure to acknowledge our team for a job well done. Thank you for sharing. Please visit again.",Good

Great comfy bed and the wi fi in this hotel was excellent.We missed breakfast the next morning, but the woman in charge of breakfast was brilliant. I wanted to bring something upstairs for my wife to eat, and she went to the back and brought me a tray...I felt like a million dollars walking upstairs with our room service order- she was really terrific!!All in all we had a very nice stay here and would highly recommend this property.",Good

"I agree with a previous reviewer that the College Club is a hidden gem. It is located on a quiet street in the Back Bay about a block to the beautiful Public Garden. I drove into Boston and was able to easily find the College Club using the clear directions on their website. (Make sure you get the door code before arriving if you arrive when the office is not open. I neglected to read that part of my reservation, so the College Club called me with the code.) The staff was very helpful, and my twin/single room was immaculate. The bed was clean and comfortable, and I had a great night's sleep. The continental breakfast was good. I peeked into one of the double rooms the next morning when the maid was cleaning. The double rooms are very spacious. My twin room was small, but plenty of room for one person. Each room was individually decorated by a professional designer. I loved my stay at the College Club.",Good
"We chose this hotel for its proximity to Sea World and because we got a great deal. We have stayed at many Hampton Inn properties across the USA and can honestly say this is the best.It's new and has very comfortable beds, a large digital TV with on screen channel guide, and a powerful stand-alone shower (no bath). The complimentary breakfast was good quality, attentively replenished and the hot foods varied daily.You can walk to Sea World in about 15mins on paths (Side walks), or there is a complimentary shuttle to avoid the car park charges. If you walk out of the back of the hotel there is also a good Bonefish Grill restaurant, a CVS and a 7 Eleven which can be accessed via a connecting path. Disney Springs and the Premium Outlet Mall at Vineland are only 15 mins drive.There are 2 adjacent hotels under construction but we found the hotel to be quiet and peaceful during our stay.We have booked again for our next trip in October",Good

"We had our second stay at the St Regis San Francisco for our annual December SF dining weekend--our first was in 2014, though I've had a few business stays in the meantime. Overall, we still love this hotel--but we did experience a few hiccups with service that gave us pause. The hotel has already provided us with a complimentary stay for 2016 to make up for the problems this year, so we feel the hotel got the message and definitely has taken steps to make it up to us.We were informed of our upgrade from the Astor to Metropolitan Suite in an email from my Ambassador the night before arrival. Yet on arrival, they didn't have us in the Metropolitan Suite. After 25 min and showing the email confirmation, we finally were given the keys to the correct suite. This was a big hiccup, but since we got the upgrade I was willing to let it go.The suite and design of the hotel and and everything about it is still near-perfect for me. I love the design of the property, and the layout of the suites/rooms. I love its location in SoMa. I love the food/beverage, from the restaurant, room service and the lobby bar. Everyone is very friendly.We did have several housekeeping mistakes, and the management response to those was less than satisfactory. Even after our complaints, housekeeping still managed to screw up, something that I'd not experienced on any previous stay at this hotel. The fact that this was the weekend immediately prior to the Christmas holiday made me wonder if the property might be a bit understaffed or under-managed. We also had issues with wifi, both in the room (which was fixed in a few hours) and in the restaurant (which was fixed in about 20 min). We finally had issues with trying to reach our butler(s) on several occasions. We would call and it would ring and ring and ring with no answer on numerous tries. That was also another first for us at this hotel. We often had to call another department to be connected to the butler or front desk, and even then it took more time than it should have. That again made us wonder if the hotel was understaffed due to the imminent holiday period.Otherwise, again, we still love this hotel. Considering that we've had nothing but near-flawless visits here, we were and are most willing to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the hotel management awarded us a free 3 night stay for next December 2016 to remedy the mistakes of this visit more than made up for us for the lack of excellent service in the instances described above. We have faith that these were unusual slip-ups, and I still look forward to returning. I also have several business trips to SF planned in 2016, and I expect to be staying here for those, as well.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I regret hear of the delays in service that you received during this visit, and sincerely appreciate your understanding and loyalty to our hotel. We look forward to welcoming you back on several occasions in 2016, but please do not hesitate to contact me directly at any time.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com",Good
"We stayed for one night after arriving from MOC airport. The staff at the desk was very welcoming and the room was great. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. Very quiet hotel and the breakfast was not bad at all. We will come back if the rates keep like this.Dear Gerald1961,Thank you so much for taking the time to write about your recent stay here at our property. We are so glad that our location was convenient for your trip from the airport. Whether you're taking a trip to any of the parks or for a quick layover, we hope you keep us in mind. Until next time, we would like to wish you safe travels and hope you have a Happy New Year.Our best,Nicholas Houck",Good
"I always stay here when coming to Redding. I feel like a VIP. In addition to the great breakfast and free coffee, the free cookies in the evenings are delicious. It's located conveniently in the middle of town as well.",Good
"Good location. Clean, roomy, convenient. Breakfast is coffee and cake. Would stay there again. Reasonable price. Expect a little train noise. After all this is the Hi Line and all the towns are along the train route. Friendly staff.",Good
"My stay at the hotel was for one night only, after a visit to Seaworld. The hotel looks great from moment you pull in to the parking lot. The feel is pleasant when you come in the lobby. Staff was nice, and helpful. The room itself was very clean, and looked great. One of the most convenient things about the hotel is that it's almost across the street from the park Seaworld. They offered breakfast in the morning. Breakfast had a pretty good variety of things to choose from. All in all I was very satisfied with the hotel, and definitely would stay here again if ever in the area.",Good
"We stayed in this Homewood Suites while traveling to Disney for the Walt Disney World Marathon. The staff was very friendly, and our room was ready early, which was great because we arrived on a Friday morning. The room was clean, smoke free and the beds were quite comfortable. My only suggestion would be that if you are traveling down specifically to go to Disney World, you might want to consider how much your taxi rides will cost from the hotel to the Disney properties. While all of the maps we looked at said the hotel was only 3-5 miles from Disney, each of our cab rides cost between 25-30, depending on which park we were at that day. The hotel does have a shuttle to Epcot, but is limited. This would have been a great location if we had brought our car, but was a little remote when just relying on taxis. Overall, a great hotel, just consider its location!",Good
"Great location in Midtown. Hotel had a cool vibe and was clean and everyone was very nice and helpful. The price was not too expensive either. The rooms are small, but that is to be expected in NY. I had a king room and there was plenty of room to get around and for two suitcases with 2 adults. The bathroom was rather small, so be prepared. They do charge a resort fee, which included a drink ticket and laundry. Sadly, when you are only there a weekend, you do not need laundry, so that is a bit of a waste and un-needed. But definitely use the drink tickets in the hotel lobby bar since you paid for it! This hotel met all my needs and would stay here again if back in NYC.",Good
Stayed at this hotel for hotel management course. Was amazed by how helpful and friendly staff was. Room was perfect. Breakfast was great. I admired the way it was managed. It was a perfect example that met all standards and expectations as a choice hotel. My stay was so nice I almost forgot I was not on vacation. I was impressed.,Good
"My husband and I stayed here with 49 other seniors with Coffee Break Tours. This was a great place. We were in room 420 overlooking the parking lot. It was a spacious room with new carpeting, lounge chair w/foot stool, desk, flat screen TV, lots of space with deep dresser. We had a microwave and refrigerator which was an added plus. There was a granite top area with a coffee maker, etc. King size bed with very comfortable bedding. It was all spotless. Nice bath with a large granite vanity, tub/shower combo was immaculate. Great lighting and a good a/c system. The breakfast area in the lobby was spacious. All the regular breakfast items available and the breakfast attendant made sure everything was cleaned up after people left the table. Jennifer was at the desk on this Sat. morning and she was a delight. Very polite, efficient, and thanked us for staying at the hotel. This was one of our better stays. Thanks for making us so comfortable.Thanks for the wonderful compliments! It sure made Jennifer happy to see she was mentioned for her customer service skills! If you're ever in the area again - come back to see us. Willis Blake DOS",Good
"This hotel is located in a perfect spot to walk the mag mile, the river walk, and even to Millennium Park. Great service. The bartenders on the roof top were exceptionally nice and fun!! The room was clean and had all of the amenities! Great place to stay.Dear SueVacaSpots, Thank you for choosing to stay at the Conrad Chicago for your recent visit and taking time to visit Noyane - the rooftop - during your time here as well.

"I came to Miami for a couple of days during March to have a break from Manhattan Island. Luxury bed made me sleep half of the day plus entire night up until morning. Breakfast was mouth-watering, and an awesome view made my morning truly inspiring. Reception desk gave a special attention to my interests and arranged all the trips and local reservations for me. Solicitous personnel at the pool knew their job very well. At night a restaurant downstairs gets packed, and no surprises here! Food is really delicious! The room was clean, and service was very considerate, as always. Definitely, the best place to stay.",Good
"Excellent service pleasant staff comfortable accommodations good food enjoyed the novelty of the place was never sure where some things were, but enjoyed walking around trying to figure them out",Good
"From check in and throughout our stay, the personnel were very attentive to our needs and went out of the way to help. The front desk people were great! The Bistro restaurant servers were excellent. They had a passion for their work! How many places have that This is our hotel of choice in Orlando now! Since this Trip Adviser review page does not let me click on service, value and rooms, I will say here that three all would get 5 stars from us!",Good
"I really liked this place. Very conveniently located, only about a 15-20 min walk to Bourbon St.. Rooms were clean and had a good vintage feeling about them. Not the best view, but then again, we were there to sleep. Even though it was on a busy street, it was very quiet. It was a bit chilly out so we didn't get a chance to use the pool but it looked like a nice little spot for lounging. All in all, I'd go back.",Good
"Hotel was verry pleasant. Staff extremely welcoming, at check-in, evening theme snacks, general front desk, checkout, and especially shuttle driver Denise. The room was very clean, good work desk, adjustable chair. Window could be opened to let fresh air in. Due to the proximity of the airport there is some noise, however easily managed to sleep through it. Breakfast had waffles, bananas, apples, juice, cereal, pre-peeled eggs, danish. There is a Wawa in walkable 0.3 miles from the hotel. Ample parking, less than 10 minutes shuttle ride, or can even take the train Eastwick station which stops across from the Wawa gas station. The hotel was in the process of receiving an overhaul.Other hotels in this area are the Embassy, Hampton, Microtel, and Courtyard.AAA rate reserved weeks in advance was a really good deal.Hello!Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback. We are extremely excited about the new product that we will showcasing. Come back and see us soon!Yours in hospitality,Paulette",Good
"I recently had the pleasure of staying in this boutique hotel, for a wedding. The staff were extremely friendly and accomodating (with great patience !)

"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful from the moment we walked through the front doors. We stayed for 4 nights, and couldn't have asked for a better location. The hotel is at the top of the quarter across from Armstrong Park... just five short blocks walk from Bourbon Street. Quick taxi/Uber service from hotel to anywhere you want to go. Breakfast was hot, and plentiful. Staff kept tables cleaned quickly for more guests to dine. Rooms were clean and big enough for three adults to not feel cramped at all. Bartender Ty was fun and made one heck of a Bloody Mary... and we will remember his meat pie next time we visit! Darlene at the front desk was an amazing help to us several times throughout our stay. The courtyard was a nice place to sit and relax and take a dip when it was super hot in the afternoon. Overall, I'd choose this hotel over and over again! Thanks BW for a great stay!Thank you for your review. We are extremely happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We take great pride in providing excellent customer service to all of our guests.We look forward to seeing you again on your next trip to New Orleans.Robert K., Manager on Duty",Good
This hotel provided us with a great holiday for two weeks on October 2012.Rooms recently decorated and were kept clean by the staff.The free breakfast was fine when you get used to the plastic plates cups and knife forks.Close to International drive but without the noise.Would go back to this Hotel when visiting OrlandoWell done Comfort Inn for a worry free holiday,Good
"We spent our anniversary weekend at the hotel. As a non-partying couple in our early 40s, it was perfect. In fact, our dinners at Red and Zuma, outside of the hotel paled in comparison to our experience at Azul. The rooms were spacious, service superb, spa was amazing. If you're looking to get away from it all and just relax, come here, sleep in, spend a day in a beach cabana, have room service, eat at Azul and get a massage or two. No need to leave.",Good
"Rooms were simple, clean and neat. Carpet gone and hardwood flooring is a pleasant touch.Beds are comfy, and our dog was welcomed.

"Ok, I can't vouch for a great nights sleep. I live in the Middle East and had just flown in from France, and slept out of sheer desperation for sleep, but jet lag reared it's ugly head about 5AM. I must say that it was an amazingly comfortable bed. My check in experience was wonderful, and check out was just as easy. The room was clean and comfortable. This was my second stay at this property and I would stay here again without hesitation.Next time you stay with us please ask for me, I would love to hear about the Middle East and the experiences you have to share if you dont mind. I will also share your comments with the front desk staff, in my opinion they are the best.. thank you for choosing us when you returned to the US",Good
"The hotel lobby was amazing, smelled relaxing. I hate the smoke smell and gambling machines. Delano was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The room was breathtaking, separate living and bedroom, had half a bath at the entrance. The tub was by far the key point of my stay. I just wish we would of stayed longer.",Good

"We stayed for family reunion prior to cruise. Nice location, while not downtown, very convenient to trolley or just a mile walk to Seattle Center. Great to have wi fi and breakfast included. Also laundry facilities and pool/fitness center. Good dining very close by. Hotel is a little dated and only had one working elevator (for 7 floors). But overall great service!",Good
"Having visited San Diego before and not necessarily enjoying the Gas Lamp District (with it's chain restaurants and conference going visitors), I was excited to discover the hip Pearl Hotel in Point Lomo. When you tally up it's affordable price, friendly customer service, inviting bar and pool area, and overall design, it's clear you have an excellent choice when staying in San Diego.The hotel is a short five minute drive from San Diego Airport, about fifteen minutes to downtown or Balboa Park, and conveniently located next to a Starbucks, grocery store, and the harbor on Shelter Island. Limited on-site parking is available for a reasonable 10 a night although it's probably best to ask the hotel to reserve a spot for you.The hotel itself is a converted motel with just over 20 rooms situated around a small pool. The main check-in area and bar feature a hip lobby and modern looking bar which also serves as a place to grab a bite to eat in the evening and a cup of coffee in the morning.The rooms while retaining that mid-century motel layout are remodeled with clean bathrooms, a comfortable bed, and a trendy design. A nice twist is that each room features a goldfish which adds a nice human touch. Our first floor room let in a little more noise than I expected from the common areas, but by midnight when staff were tidying up and closing the bar, there was little noise to keep you up.While we did run into an issue during our stay, the staff were extremely helpful and pro-active in making sure we left on a good foot. Had they stopped there, I would still have written a positive review but their follow up call and gesture proves that this is a well managed hotel that truly cares about their customers.On behalf of the entire Pearl management and staff, thank you for taking the time to leave a kind and detailed review! We truly appreciate it. Your support means the world to us. Please come visit us again soon. Tell a friend.",Good

"For a 3Star Hotel, we could not have been any happier with our selection! The hotel staff were super nice and efficient, especially Jeana at the front desk and Tatum in house keeping. The lobby is great with a very nice and plentiful breakfast, as well as snacks midday and coffee or lemon infused water all day! Our room was super clean and could not have been nicer, plus having two separate vanities/sinks really spoiled us. There was even a window in the bathroom for FRESH air. We found the French Quarters to be dirty and intimidating at times (so many homeless), so being in this area was another plus...surrounded by beautiful homes, trolley across the street, a few blocks from the Fresh Market grocery and the best bonus of all was the grassy park right next door which came in handy for those late night/early morning potty breaks for our dog. I am so glad that we were unable to find a pet friendly hotel WITH GRASS in the Quarters as we would have been so unhappy and absolutely loved our stay here, and this location for half the price also!! One more thing is parking...it was free and gated They gave us a remote control so we could come and go as we pleased knowing we would always have a free parking space waiting for us at the end of the day. Never saw a manager, but did not need to. Everything ran smooth and efficient. Good job!!",Good

"Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids) stayed At SpringHill for 2 days. We used self-parking which is located close to the lobby, so really didn't need valet service. The staff, from those manning the check-in to the cleaning crew, were all extremely polite, professional, and helpful. We were assisted by Jesus at check-in and the guy was really quick and provided wonderful service. We stayed in the corner suite with bay view and if you can get it, get it! The view is awesome and room size was adequate for our family. ( Although the room is listed as a suite, the size is a bit smaller compared to other suite rooms IMO. However, the price is much better.) The room was clean and the bathroom was exceptionally clean, to the delight of my wife. The AC worked well to keep the mostly-glass-walled-room comfortable. The free breakfast buffet did get a bit crowded but again, the staff was friendly and worked really hard to accommodate everyone. The only issue or nuisance at the hotel was that the elevator doors open and close really fast. So fast that we would need to get the kids ready to jump in as soon as we heard the ding. I guess this can be good or bad depending on your situation. Overall, good room, great staff, and being clean is a winning model for a hotel. I would definitely stay at SpringHill again, and would recommend to friends and family.",Good
This Hotel was very centrally located. Host were very Friendly and attentive to guest needs. I was disappointed with the cost and efficiency of valet parking. Took almost 30 minutes to get our car after it was called for.,Good

"We have stayed in downtown Atlanta many many times and usually stay at the Hilton downtown. We decided at the last minute to try this property and we made a great decision. The location and ease of getting to hotel were great. As I've read in past reviews and very true on our visit....parking in the main lot is very limited. We were greeted at checkin by two very friendly clerks. We were a little early, but our room was ready. True, the rooms are on the small side, but that doesn't take away from how comfortable the room really was. Every employee that we encountered were very friendly and helpful with directions or suggestions for restaurants or whatever. The breakfast is just what you are used to from a Hampton Inn....very good with plenty of choices. Cold water and cookies were available a the front desk when you came back to hotel in evening. Overall a great stay and will stay there again when we return in April. Oh, parking is 20.00 per day...for downtown not really that bad.",Good
"Hotel staff and service were great. Perfect place to stay for families. Rooms were especially roomy, clean, and well appointed. A relaxing place to stay. We were able to walk to all the tourist sites downtown. For us, it was important that we get our steps counted on our trackers we were able to walk to Chinatown and Pike's Place Market with ease.",Good
"We stayed here one night while passing through town. The room was very clean, spacious but just a touch too costly at 131 a night. 100 for the family sized room is more realistic. Oh Well.

"The location is in the perfect place! What I like the most besides the friendly staff, clean rooms/facility is the hotel is tucked away from the busy street. Your car is parked practically right outside your room or within eye's view from your room, which gives any car owner piece of mind while you're at Disney all day. The pool and hot tub are maintained with fresh clean towels set aside in the pool area. Not only are you incredibly close to the main gate to Disney park, you are very close to a lot of great places to dine-in, all within in a very short walking distance. With very reasonable room prices you get a fridge, microwave, coffee maker free breakfast! We were very pleased to have one room for our family of five. The room was very spacious which included 2 queen beds a bunk bed set for our two younger kids. Del Sol is the better way to enjoy the comforts of home while being on vacation!!!",Good

Hotels near to the city centre are much more expensive and it only cost 9 dollars in an uber to the harbour plus the bus terminus is only ten minutes walk with frequent travel to the centre. Our stay was comfortable and the staff helpful and polite, no problems with the room It was clean and roomy and you also have free on site parking which is a bonus. A couple of small swimming pools if you would like a relaxing dip and well kept gardens throughout the location. On site restaurant and bar which we didn't use as we were out early and back late. Easy to find just off the freeway would definitely stay again when visiting the area.",Good
"We stayed for 5 nights with our 2 children, we arrived from australia at 10am and were very grateful to get an early checkin, the motel is a long walk from disneyland and the easiest way to get there is by the art bus which comes every 20 minutes. Our room was clean and services everyday and the kids loved the pool, we did find the room was very hot though and the air conditioning was too noisy to use over night. If we were returning to Anaheim we would chose a hotel directly across from disneyland to make it easier to return to the room during the day.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Pavilions.

"This is my sixth year in a row coming to New Orleans. We have a daughter in school here and I had previously come to several conferences for my work. In the past we had stayed at fancier places in town -- Wyndham, Roosevelt, etc., etc. -- but not only is this place substantially more economical, it has much nicer, more professional staff, is more comfortable, and just has a better ambience overall. The room was spotless and was cleaned perfectly each day shower hot and without one of those crazy angled nozzles that spill water all over the floor. Our room, a double, was perfectly sized with lovely light coming in from the windows that overlooked a lovely courtyard. The internet worked perfectly with no password required (why do most hotels make guests go through that nonsense)The breakfasts (wonderful croissants, cold, fresh OJ, great coffee) arrived on time, the valet parking was flawless, the rooms clean, the desk people unfailingly pleasant and helpful, and the overall experience was by far the best I've had in the city. To me, it was a taste of the real New Orleans -- friendly, personal, comfortable, and an extraordinary value.We will be staying here whenever we come to the city from now on.",Good
We have stayed in many hotels in Seattle over the years. The Grand Hyatt is one of the best hotels in town. It's location can't be beat and the staff is always very nice. I would always recommend this property to anyone traveling to Seattle as it's one of the best run Hyatts in the USA.,Good

"What a great surprise. Had to book a hotel at the last (LAST) minute and selected Orchard. The hotel is fantastic. Very clean and modern with well appointed rooms. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the rooms and bathroom had plenty of space and I never felt crowded.Most of all, the doorman and staff were the friendliest I ever encountered. I stayed three nights and the staff was fantastic every night.Next time I am out in SF, I will be seeking out this hotel. It is definitely on my go-to list.We're glad you could find a cozy room here in a pinch, Anthony! Furthermore, it's fantastic that our service staff and doorman made you feel right at home. We'd love to welcome you back the next time you visit San Francisco.Wishing you all the best,The Orchard Garden Hotel",Good

"This hotel is conveniently situated near the Riverwalk Convention area as well as the Bourbon Street area. I walked from my hotel to both of these locations for a week. This hotel is clean, nostalgic, and accommodating. We received free drink cards upon check-in for drinks in the lobby from 530P to 7P. Although there are no restaurants in this hotel, they can get delivery of almost anything you can think of as far as food. The first night I was there, I was leary of walking to a nearby restaurant or Bourbon Street, but there was no need to be. This hotel is growing and has a brand new wing that will open in about 6-12 months. The construction commenced M-F starting at 7A, but no contruction on the weekends! I believe the cost was very good for the accommodations and service.",Good

"We really enjoy this hotel. The staff is helpful, the room very clean and the location is perfect for walking around Athens. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 rating this time is because the bed was hard as a rock. We saw the next morning that it apparently was adjustable, but we went through a terrible night.",Good
"I absolutely love this hotel for all the reasons why you should love a hotel. I love the location because it is literally right across the street from Disneyland.

We stayed at this Fairfield inn in Feb. 2016 with a 2.5 year old. It was perfect for a family. We had a room overlooking the pool which I loved. The pool gets a lot of sun in the morning which is nice for sipping coffee by or if it is warm enough a dip. The pool was heated where we didn't mind swimming in it even when the temp didn't get above 70. Breakfast was better than I expected. The eggs were actually scrambled not like the weird omelet I had before at a budget motel. We always had enough at breakfast to carry us through at least the next cuban sandwich shop. I used the gym there which was ok a few cardio machines including an elliptical and free weights and exercise balls. The nice thing was I was the only one in there both times I used it. The hotel isn't walking distance to much but we were able to find parking every time we went downtown. I think it was quieter because we weren't around any partying.,Good
I really enjoyed my week at the conference center and hotel. The service was good for the most part. Arthur is an amazing service provider and very eager to help patrons have a good experience. I really liked the conference center. The rooms are comfortable and the snacks were good. I'd like to see a little more protein in any and all good that is provided. The bathrooms were nice and the staff very easy to work with. I would recommend anyone to enjoy the conference center for training or event. The parking is decent and cost is a little high.Thank you for taking the time to share details from your recent visit with us. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay but even more thrilled that you shared your experience with the thousands of visitors to Trip Advisor each day.,Good
If you are planning to go to Americasmart and want inexpensive accommodation then this is the place to stay. 7 min walk to Americasmart and free parking if needed. Rooms a good size and clean.

"Stayed here during a conference being held at the mega hotel Hilton up the block from Abri. Glad I chose the Abri, medium sized, clean hotel in a Union Square central location. My room was small but perfectly formed and the walk-in shower was powerful. My room had a strange smell to it during my stay which meant I had to have the window open most of the time for fresh air. Ask for an inner room to avoid noise from the busy street outside.I visited SF about 5 years ago so was shocked at the amount of homeless people everywhere this time round. Every street corner was filled with people begging so be prepared to have your dollar bills ready. Breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was good. Great shopping near by. Enjoy!",Good

"My friend and I spent 6 nights at the Hotel Rex while attending a conference at the Moscone Center, and it is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. It's basically how I envision my fantasy home: literary references everywhere, warm and eclectic colour scheme, coffee every morning and wine (one glass free for guests!) every evening, and live jazz music once a week. I am in love with this place. The location is wonderful, too, just a few blocks from Union Square and 15 minutes walk to the conference centre. I do have to say thank goodness for conference rates, because as lovely as the Rex is, I still can't imagine paying 360/night for a hotel (but I'm a poor grad student, so take that as you will).",Good

Nice and good breakfast. We stayed here for four nights while we were visiting Philadelphia. Overall we were pleased without stay. My family Loved the breakfast! The eggs were very good and they had an oatmeal station that my daughters loved. The lady that ran the breakfast was very helpful and friendly. It was very easy to get to downtown to see the sights. The hotel was clean. The only thing bad I have to say is that one day our room was not cleaned. It's not a big deal but to return to trash and old towels wasn't something we were expecting. I would stay here again however! Thank you for making the Fairfield Inn/Marriott your choice hotel. We are excited that you were able to enjoy our breakfast and that your stay was wonderful.

"I've seen the buildings that comprise this hotel plenty of times, but not until we stayed here, at the last minute, could I have known how unique and beautiful the place was, behind the street-side facade.

"Hotel Abri is a clean, cute, boutique hotel with a great location. I've stayed at over 5+ hotels in the area and this had by far the best staff.

In terms of the most impressive of the staff, Kelly Nguyen stuck out and really went above and beyond. Thank you.",Good
"We just stayed here for the first time and have mixed feelings, mostly good. First, the good. The facility is relatively new, having opened in the last couple years. The staff is very nice, pleasant, and helpful. The crew at the front desk was great! We stayed in a two-room villa, which was roomy and had all the luxuries of a nice apartment. We really like the large bathrooms! The snorkeling at the beach directly outside the hotel is pretty good, and even better in front of the Westin Ocean Villas right next door. The beach services manager did a great job of addressing two couples who were extremely loud and spewing offensive and foul language around the pool, and we appreciated her professionalism.However, we found the pool/bar/restaurant configuration at Nanea to be less than optimal. They only have one pool, and it's not extremely large. The result is that everyone is compressed into one pool, including infants in diapers, toddlers, teens, drunk adults, people playing catch with balls, obnoxious people, well-behaved people, etc. The facility has one bar, located one step outside the pool, which means that people bring their drinks into the same pool with everyone else. The TVs in the bar can be heard across the pool area, adding to all the noise. There's one restaurant, which is connected to the bar in the same area. The facility has two hot tubs, both of which are in the single pool. The deck area also compresses people around the single pool with up to three rows of tightly spaced lounge chairs. The overall feeling is a noisy, busy, crowded area that was not very relaxing for us. We spent most of our 'pool' time in another area of the resort that was more quiet and relaxing, but is tucked away into a corner of the facility with no view of the ocean. We have stayed at the Westin Ocean Villas (North and South) in the past and prefer the pool layout in those facilities over that of Nanea, so we will probably return to North/South next time we return.Aloha Brian D!Thank you for sharing such a detailed review of your stay.I will be sure to share your feedback with the food and beverage department, pool service, and all other corresponding departments.Should you choose to return please reach out to a front desk manager to assist with your stay.

This was a great hotel pick away from the hustle and bustle. It was a short drive to the aquarium which we did not mind. The grounds across the street from this property are breath taking and make for a great photo opt. We did not eat here because the food was pricey. If you stay venture out into the Galleria centre for cheaper food. This is located just past the pool and spa. My only disappointment was that the outdoor pool was closed. It is a beautiful hotel and I would recommend it to friends.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience! I am glad you enjoyed your stay and we hope to have the opportunity to have you back with us in the near future!,Good
"We stayed here on a recent visit to New Orleans. This hotel is handy for walking to pretty much anywhere in the French Quarter, even with young children. Parking is limited to valet parking but there is a large public lot just across the street that costs virtually the same but without the wait for retrieval. The rooms were nice, clean, and quiet. There is a small interior courtyard with pool that was a great break for the kids. Located on Decatur, we were close to everything but not in the middle of the craziness of other locations. The staff were very helpful and friendly.Thank you for sharing your positive experience regarding your most recent stay at our historic New Orleans hotel.",Good
"On a recent business trip to New Orleans, I was able to extend my stay for an evening and in doing so, I chose to stay closer to the French Quarter (the host hotel was near the Superdome, about 1 mile away). The hotel structure itself dates to the 1800's as the very knowledgeable front desk clear explained when I inquired. She knew all the details and was very proud to share her knowledge. It certainly made for a very nice welcome at check-in (which was efficient and quick).After quickly settling in, I was off to explore the French Quarter and the hotel location on the edge of the historic district makes walking to everything quite easy, yet it's just far enough away from the nightlife to keep things quiet at night. Shops, restaurants, bars and historic sites are all around and across the street Louis Armstrong Park can be accessed a few blocks away.My room on the 2nd floor overlooked the lovely courtyard with trees, chairs to relax and an out door pool. The room was fresh and clean with comfortable beds, a pleasant bathroom with ample lighting, free Wi-Fi (easy to connect and fast speed), a refrigerator, HDTV and safe (large enough for my 14 laptop). The only item needing attention in my room was the grout in the shower, which must be a challenge in such a humid climate.Considering this is such a historic property, they have done a nice job connecting all the buildings and keeping the guest room modern yet with old world charm. Rooms face the courtyard, nearby buildings, the street - so be sure to request the view / area that most suits your needs.Although I did not take advantage of the pool, I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast in the morning. A nice mix of hot and cold options, including waffles, eggs, yogurt, cereal, etc. The staff were ever present and helpful to guests, a very positive experience. My only complaint was the oatmeal was only available using the instant packets, which is never as good as a nice hot crock often found at hotels today.In the evening, the hotel also opens the breakfast area for food and drinks, but I explored the area instead. The hotel lends itself to a relaxing escape, and I ended up meeting a couple who are regulars to the hotel and New Orleans! The best guest is a repeat one and that certainly speaks to the quality experience.While the focus appears to be leisure travelers, the hotel has everything required for a business traveler as well. If returning to New Orleans, I would certainly return again and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, affordable hotel with nice amenities. For meeting all my needs and the expectations of a Best Western Plus hotel, I would certainly rate my experience 5 stars.We are glad that we were able to be a nice break from your business trip and hope to see you again the next time you are in New Orleans.Thank You, Bryant Faul - General Manager",Good
"Our room was clean and nicely appointed with all the necessary amenities. There was a bit of a musty odor when we first arrived, but that went away as the air circulated. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the breakfast was good with lots of choices.Thank you for making the Fairfield Inn/Marriott your choice hotel, we are delighted that we were able to ensure that your stay was enjoyable.

The hotel is close to the Disneyland entrance. The staff were pleasant and the room was clean and spacious. We will stay again next year. We didn't use the pool but it is a good size. We didn't take advantage of the breakfast which were included as we preferred to sleep in.,Good

"This was really a nice find in NYC. The price was great, excellent value for money. The included breakfast was quite a spread. Room was small but clean.

"Decided to do a quick SF downtown get away and this hotel was in a perfect location - walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown and North Beach. If you need to visit the wharf, hop on public transit a few blocks down. Gallerias room is small but very quaint and have been updated so one doesn't feel claustrophobic ! We had the queen bed and it was just right for a night - travel light - not a lot of floor space but they do have a small closet for your luggages. Rooms are small but it didn't bother us- bed linens were comfortable that's what matters. The property also has a third floor which opens up to a garden and small running track if you need to stretch your legs ! The reservation agent provided us with a pretty good deal so I couldn't turn it down - nice boutique hotel in the heart of the city. Wifi- free the first night ONLYParking- 49 a night with in and out privilegesFree wine reception in the evenings from 4-6pm in the lobby.Will come back since they gave us 15 off for the next booking.Dear MillieWT,Thank you so much for the five-star review!!We are all pleased that your recent stay at Galleria Park went well enough that you plan to return in the future! The location is a wonderful draw to those looking for a city getaway for the weekend as you are able to access all of San Francisco without a car thanks to public transit. The Garden Terrace is a huge hit with our guests because it is very unique to have a green space in the center of a city (especially on the 3rd floor of a hotel!) Having a garage of our own is great, as it allows us to offer the valet service that is important to a number of our guests who need access to their car throughout their stay.We look forward to your return visit in the future!Sincerely,Jordan Whitney",Good
"The staff is very welcoming to both you and your dog. You are right on the streetcar line and there are plenty of safe neighborhoods around the hotel to walk your dog. I would highly recommend it. I am a local and stayed here during a house emergency for two weeks. They made a bad experience bearable until I could get back into my house. Thanks so much!V2885MQkarenv, Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are so happy to hear we were able to ease the transition for you. Please feel free to stop by and see us anytime!",Good
"We felt this hotel was perfect for taking the trolley to every location. Clean, Comfortable Bed, Air Conditioning worked great, breakfast was a hot Continental breakfast but you could grab juices and water out of the fridge in the lobby without charge and they always had fresh baked cookies. We were wanting to stay near the French Quarter but they were booked up and we were so glad we ended up staying in the Garden District. It was a nicer area and only took a short ride by trolley to get to the French Quarter and down to the Casino. We had secure parking. When we first checked in, we had a problem with our remote and the maintenance man came immediately and fixed the issue immediately. We had great recommendations from the front dest clerk. Just a very pleasant stay on a 2 month trip we were on.Maggie, thank you for taking the time to review your stay! I'm glad we were a fun spot on your two month trip! Even though we are not located in the French Quarter, we are so close that you can still easily get there and enjoy all it has to offer. Then after you explore there, you can come back and enjoy our quieter neighborhood! I hope you had a great road trip! We will see you the next time you visit New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager",Good

"Attractive old hotel about 10 minute walk from the French quarter. Lovely internal courtyard. Staff very helpful booking river cruise etc. Room on the small side, quite comfortable BUT no windows. I suppose we could have asked to move but as we didn't spend much time in the room we didn't bother. Parking a bit pricey.",Good

They have a complimentary breakfast that was very good, pancakes, bagels, english muffins, various yogurts, oatmeal, coffee, tea, juices, milks, hot chocolate. easily accessible from the freeway with lots to do and see within walking distance. The staff very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend you stay here, there is shuttle stop right outside the door that takes you to downtown Disney, and other local attractions, best of all you can purchase tickets at the front desk of the hotel. Bottom line this is my hotel of choice when i stay in the area Love it and the staff.....",Good
"It's a nice hotel, but could use some work. Staff is clearly overworked and they seem short handed. Only 2-elevators and one was not working one day I was there. Only one goes to the parking garage. One day Breakfast was basically out of food by 8:30am, and it goes until 9:30. 45-min wait for a 1-egg omelet at the omelet bar. Rooms are very clean, showers are weak, but a nice size. Bed was good, towels were good. Nice to have a full kitchen even if I did not use it. TV selection is limited, less than most hotels. Rooms were very quiet, could not hear the street noise too much. Ask in advance if you want a view other than a Tram and Mc.Donalds. The Space Needle is on the other side. Overall if you can get a good rate, it's worth booking. No Room Service at this location.",Good
It was nice to stay. All facility was excellent but expensive. I know this grade of hotel must be expensive but I am not going for my personal travel. My friends stayed with me and his room was kind of old. Shower was not working well. Anyhow most of services are just great. Thank you.,Good
"Stayed for 3 nights and was very happy with the accommodation and service provided.Yes, there were renovations going on but we did not hear any noise or was inconvenienced at all. The workers took the rear service elevator (2R or 1R) and other than the faint smell of paint while passing the rooms being renovated, we hardly noticed any construction going on. All the information and amenities provided in the hotel website were accurate- great to do research ahead of time and know what is expected. The basics were all there: Clean hotel, professional staff, good communication and thoughtfulness (front desk remembered/addressed me by name during conversations from day 1-3).Pros: 1.Staff Hospitality and Friendliness- The staff that we met were all delightful and friendly. They engaged us in conversation and made us feel welcomed. Front desk Eimy and the night front desk person (Paul) was accommodating and helpful, so as the sous chef, housekeeping and restaurant staff, The genuine energy and hospitality from the staff was evident. Their courtesy and friendliness made us feel welcomed. We were consistently greeted with a hello and eye contact- the housekeeping staff, restaurant servers, front desk, facilities or construction workers that we meet in the lobby, hall way, elevator or restaurant, This may be basic service but truly made a difference during our stay,2. The shuttle service was excellent. Quick and friendly drivers (Terrance and Andreas). I called the front desk for a pick up and it took about 10 minutes for the driver to arrive at A 44 (the pick up location). After a red eye flight, this could not be any better.Throughout our stay, we used the shuttle to take us to the restaurants nearby, to an event location and of course to the airport. The shuttle service was a big bonus in this hotel. 3. Lobby- Clean, new furniture and nice modern decor. Very welcoming and comfortable.4. Rooms- Spacious, A/C worked well, nice comfortable bed, microwave, refrigerator and well appointed rooms (booked 2 rooms). The bathroom was quite small but clean. The bedroom and living rooms are separated. Requested a roll away bed (10) and it fit perfectly fine in the living room with the sofa bed, desk,and a chair, This hotel is a category 2 and going through renovation. It was clean, comfortable and functional. Areas of Opportunity:1. Breakfast menu selection- The food selection was quite limited, It is the usual fare (french toast, bread, bagel, eggs, sausage and bacon with fruit, oatmeal and cereal). Would be nice to have an omelet station. They do cook eggs to order and had scrambled egg whites with spinach on one of the days, Service was fast and friendly (provided beverages). The fresh fruit was not so fresh as it tasted sour and looked mushy. The server was informed and he took action immediately,Some tips:1.Hotel shuttle is available within 2 mile radius and covers about 25 restaurants -from fine dining to fast food, a mini-mart, and a souvenir gift shop. 2. The gas station closest to the hotel charges twice as much. If you need to fill the rental car before heading to the airport, the gas prices at the 7-Eleven is much cheaper.3. Super Wal-mart is about 7 minutes away and has every thing-food, clothes, souvenirs, pharmacy, party supplies, etc.. However, the hotel shuttle does not go there and have to use a private transport company or taxi, (costed us 24 round trip). 4. Transport to Downtown Disney or Epcot is 100 Round Trip. Van can accommodate 9 people. Just let the front desk know 30 minutes to 1 hour before to schedule pick up.",Good
"We needed an affordable park and stay for an extended trip (our son got married in Mexico!) and this Super 8 met those needs perfectly. It covered the amount of days we required and gave us a beginning and end point before traveling again, which was also perfect! It took the stress off of rushing and allowed us to relax...

"Everything you read is right. Best spot for tourist attractions if you have a car and want to live it in parking and walk. Parking is ok, even if we drive a large van like us. Right in the heart of North Beach. They respect all all request for the room ( back from front street, 2 beds and refrigerator )Great price for San Francisco. But the key words are : FREE PARKING !!!",Good
"This is the second time our group of 4 stays here while on business in Seattle. The location is not too bad, just a 15-20 minute walk from the business center. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The service is great - helped us out a couple of times with checking luggage in and out and getting us a cab. The hot breakfast in the morning is a great convenience prior to heading to business. The price per room per night is great if you don't mind walking a bit.thefoodlover1001,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts on your most recent stay at SpringHill Suites Seattle Downtown.

"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"I have to admit that after reading some of the reviews about this hotel prior to leaving for our trip I was nervous and hesistant about staying here. Normally we stay at Staybridge Suites properties so this was the first time at a Hilton extended stay or suite hotel. We arrived around 8pm the day of our check-in and were greeted by a professional and friendly front desk agent. We had booked a studio King bed suite, but to our surprise we must have been upgraded to a one room King suite... this was awesome! The hotel looks and smells like it is brand new. Yes there are a few signs of wear and tear here and there and the hallway carpets could use a cleaning soon, but that is to be expected when you run a hotel very close to a theme park and have very little down time in the busy months to do deep cleaning and repairs. I would almost bet that they will do repairs and deep cleaning in the late fall or winter months. Anyway, the hotel is very brightly lit inside and out and is decorated with a modern touch. The kitchen had granite countertops, cherry cabinets, dishwasher, stovetop, garbage disposal, cabinets filled with pots, pans, toaster, coffeemaker, utensils, storage containers for food, plates, etc. The refrigerator was full size... the only disappointment is that it does not have an icemaker like the Staybridge Suites properties do. The living room area was rather spacious with a sofa/bed, easy chair, ottomon that serves also as a coffee table and a nice size flat screen tv with a dvd player. The bedroom had a king bed, two nightstands, dresser with a flat screen tv on it, a nice size closet with full mirrored doors, in room safe, vanity and sink which was very spacious and well lit, separate room for the shower and toilet. The bedroom area is separated from the living room by a door. The shower has a crescent rod which gives you extra room inside and the area is brightly lit. The only complaint is that they do not have a bathroom fan in the shower area and it gets very steamy and wet in the area from the shower. Hotel towels were new and very fluffy and the soap, shampoo, etc. was Nuetragena products which smelled nice. The bed itself was very comfy, high, and soft... but not too soft. They offer you hard and soft pillows on the bed, we asked for a few more and they had no problem with that. Each day housekeeping would clean the room and give us coffee, tea, and popcorn which was nice (same as Staybridge Suites). The housekeepers seemed very accomodating to your needs and requests, THE ONLY NUISANCE I found was that they were inconsistent with their daily cleaning- some days they would forget to leave soap or shampoo or towels or dishwasher soap. We would always alert the front desk and got what we needed but it was a bit of a pain in the butt sometimes. The tv has a decent selection of channels, but I would have expected a better variety considering that it is a Hilton property. The breakfast area is rather big and I never found it to be too crowded or not maintained properly. My only complaint with breakfast is that it doesn't start early enough and ends too early as well. I understand that some people get up early to go to the parks, but some of us stay at the parks late and would like to have a late breakfast and breakfast ends at 9:30am which is early compared to other hotels. The breakfast offerings were rather extensive with danish, bagels, donuts, cereals, oatmeal, yogurt, fresh fruit, juices, usually two hot offerings each day ( omlettes, hash, bacon, sausage, eggs). The best part of breakfast is that they have made to order waffles. You can make your own waffles and they offer two kinds... the regular square kind or Mickey Mouse (head) shaped waffles... that was really cool. The hotel website said that the hotel offered made to order omelettes and eggs but they simply had pre-made (probably frozen) products... this was somewhat of a disappointment. Overall though, breakfast was good.Parking can be a problem at this hotel as it seems like they only have enough spots for exactly the number of rooms they have... meaning, if you arrive late at night you have to search and search for a spot and it is probably in a non-desirable area of the hotel and not close to an entrance. The hotel is located right next to I-4, but we never heard any traffic noise from our room and we always knew how traffic was flowing on I-4 before we left the room. My only big complaint about the hotel is that it is definitely off of the beaten path. It is on the Palm Parkway which in Lake Buena Vista has hotels, restaurants, and shops on it... HOWEVER, where the hotel is located is a newer undeveloped section of the Palm Parkway and there is literally NOTHING around you but undeveloped land. You cannot walk to restaurants and shops, plus it is quite a drive each day to State Road 535 which goes through the heart of Lake Buena Vista. Still, because the hotel was new and offers a lot it was not bad being quite so far away. We were still close to Downtown Disney which was awesome.OVERALL-1. The hotel is like brand new and is very clean.2. The breakfast is quite nice.3. The Mickey Mouse waffles were awesome.4. The suites are quite spacious.5. The hotel is off the beaten path and further away from the rest of the hotels and restaurants in Lake Buena Vista.6. There is nothing around the hotel as far as restaurants and shops ( just undeveloped land).7. Parking seems to be at a premium when the hotel is busy, sold out, or if you arrive late!8. FREE hotel wifi was also good!",Good
"A dozen old friends decided to take advantage of a special offer at the Estancia to spend some time together. In a sentence, we had a wonderful time. The staff were each helpful and friendly. A gardener stopped what he was doing to give me directions (the grounds are very large and could use a few more directional signs). The concierge advised us of some restaurants with water views that could accommodate our group and made the reservation for us.The rooms at our price point, while not impressive looking, were roomy enough, very clean, had large flat screen TVs, and nice toiletries. The bathroom was modern with marble counter top. Hair dryer and iron were provided. One pricing feature I liked was the hospitality fee. Instead of being nickeled and dimed for different extras, the most common ones are all in one fee which included access to the exercise area, wi-fi, bottled water, a welcome drink in the lobby, morning coffee in the wine bar, and a free margarita (very tasty) in the bar. Our special offer included valet parking. The hotel was very busy with several weddings and other events, but the valets never kept us waiting longer than 5-10 minutes. There is a lavish buffet breakfast on the weekends which is 22, more than my budget allows for breakfast. The server told us that for half that price, we could have a 'continental breakfast' which included all the cold items, even smoked salmon with capers and also hot oatmeal. That was a good deal.Located directly across from University of California San Diego and adjacent to the Salk Institute, this property is not right on the beach, but there are walking trails next to the hotel. While the shops and attractions of La Jolla and San Diego are nearby, the Estancia provides a tranquil retreat from the crowds. Our room on the ground floor was rather dark. I would request a room on the third floor next time. A major refurbishing is planned for early 2013 which should brighten up the rooms. I would also have liked more outdoor places to sit and relax with my friends. We had a very enjoyable stay.Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review. Your comments and feedback are very much appreciated by the team here at the hotel as well as potential future guests. It sounds like you had a nice time catching up with old friends, and Im glad our concierge was able to assist your group with a fun and memorable night out. We hope to welcome you back for the next reunion!",Good
My stay at your hotel was pretty nice. I would have liked a microwave in the room and the corners of the bed frame are sharp. I hit my shins on them a couple of times. I also think there should be something in the room to show what all the hotel has to offer their guests.Thank you for your review. Your comments are most appreciated as it is important to us to know what improvements can be made for a more enjoyable guest experience. We hope to have you back again soon.,Good
"Great customer service and new current dcor trends. The hotel made me feel at home. Fantastic quality in bedding and mattress. Slept wonderfully and the rooms were quiet even thought I was next to an elevator, I didn't hear it at all. Breakfast had a great selection and overall very good. Kitchen service employees extremely helpful and always attentive to make sure we had what we needed. We were always greeted with a sincere smile. Great job training and hiring customer oriented people. Keep it up!",Good

"This is a great place to stay for a family trip, and it is well priced for what you get. We stayed 7 nights and very much enjoyed this property. We would come back.The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was spotless. Housekeeping was accommodating about extra towels and our other requests.The free breakfast was great with a nice selection of hot and cold items, and the Mickey waffles were a big hit with my daughter. I was, however, disappointed with the lack of fresh fruit. The only choices were apples and bananas, and they ran out early and weren't restocked. If similar properties in Canada can give fresh fruit in the winter, I was surprised that my only choice in Florida in the spring was apples and bananas. There is a fellow working dining room clearing tables in the mornings named Jean Louis. He is warm, friendly, and a real treat to interact with. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned another fellow who seemed to do the cooking who wasn't really friendly.We only used the free supper once during our stay. It was adequate, but not excellent. We have stayed at Homewood Suites in Carlsbad and Anaheim, and the meals can vary in quality by location. The real benefit of this free meal is that it is easy and convenient when you are traveling with children who are exhausted after a day at one of the parks. If I was traveling as a couple, I'd probably eat evening meals elsewhere.The free wifi is strong, and we were able to stream Netflix most of the time we tried, even when the hotel got really full later on in the week.The pool is really nice, but could use more deck chairs. They were hard to come by in the afternoon. You can get room service and bar service from the other hotel that shares the pool area. The fitness center is large (probably because two hotels share it) and has a number of cardio machines. Two of them were not working while we were there. The basketball court is a nice touch, and was well used the whole time we stayed.The shuttle service to Epcot Center is a nice touch, but I wish it ran constantly. There are three times you can catch a ride over to Epcot in the morning, and three times you can catch a ride back in the late afternoon/evening, and that's it. I'd like to be able to come and go more often so I could get to the parks early before they are too busy, then come back for a nap, and return for the evening fireworks. The shuttle service here won't let that happen. Because the Disney parks are so close, renting a car and paying to park at Disney is certainly an option that is made easier by the free parking at this hotel.",Good
"What a nice family owned motel. Brought back memories of what motels used to be like. Very clean, great price and pleasant and professional staff. Two great restaurants within walking distance is nice too.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are happy that you enjoyed your stay.",Good
"Wonderful stay, location was great, close to bus and trolley stops. Only a short walk to the beach. Rooms are good with a very comfortable bed and lovely view. I struggled to use the coffee machine, but staff were all very helpful. Great to have breakfast included. Wonderful and friendly staff. I would book at Waikiki Gateway Hotel again.Aloha,Our incredible staff and unbeatable location are just 2 of the reasons that the Waikiki Gateway Hotel is the place to stay in Waikiki. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. Mahalo for choosing the Waikiki Gateway Hotel we cant wait to see you again.",Good
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt House, the service is excellent and the rooms good. The rooms are spacious but more comparable to a studio apartment than a regular hotel room. The location even though it is next to the Space Needle is a tad bit inconvenient. There are very few decent restaurants in the area but having said that the hotel offers free transportation within a one mile radius of the hotel. Additionally there is a monorail that goes from the Space Needle to downtown.The free breakfast buffet is comparable to most other hotels of this kind but the area was definitely more clean and organized than the norm.Mark J,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge",Good
"We needed a hotel with airport transportation arriving rather late in the evening, and this came up online. The bus took awhile to pick us up but the driver was very pleasant and took my husband back to pick up our rental car next morning, and to the airport for a very early flight after our second stay Sunday night. The hotel grounds were attractive, room adequate and breakfast very good, with a discount. Would use it again for a before or after flight motel at half the airport hotel price.",Good
The Found:Re is a truly unique experience. It is really an art gallery posing as a hotel. Wonderful pieces to view everywhere. I thoroughly enjoyed strolling the property to view the art. Great room on the 8th floor. The shower is awesome: not just a walk in but a sit in with a jack and jill sink. Nice bath amenities from Bigelow. Great bar with awesome bar keeps Maxwell and Kyle. I'd make a trip to Phoenix even in the summer just to stay here.Thank you! We are so happy to hear you had a great stay! Please visit again soon.,Good
"Enjoyed our visit and service was great! Appreciated the good restaurant recommendations from the front desk staff. Got the corner room on the 10th floor overlooking Petco park which was a bonus. The huge bathroom and super deep bathtub was awesome. Special shout out for Tina who was our room attendant who left us personal notes each day after servicing our room. Loved the proximity in the gas lamp, we could walk to so many things. We would stay here again when visiting SD again.I cant thank you enough jadoc for your glowing review! We have an incredible team here that genuinely cares about every guest that walks through our doors and I am beyond thrilled that you experienced it firsthand with Tina. I will be sure to recognize her for taking such wonderful care of you. Thanks so much for taking time to write. I hope to have you back with us again soon. Cheers! Shannon",Good
"This hotel is located away from downtown, but can reached with a short taxi ride or the transit system. The rooms were nice and pleasant and very clean! The moment I arrived the staff was very courteous and kind and exceeded all my expectations. I arrived early and my bags were stored in a secure location by the staff so I could explore the city. Staff was very knowledgable about the city and area. The hotel runs a shuttle that runs within a mile of the hotel. The driver of the shuttle was prompt when called for pickups to and from hotel. I requested a late checkout and it was accommodated immediately. I had problems printing my boarding ticket prior to leaving the hotel and the front desk allowed me to e-mail my ticket to them and they printed it for me. I would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind not being in the heart of downtown and the tourist areas.If you are a light sleeper, request a room away from the street. The hotel is located near a hospital and ambulances go by throughout the night.",Good
"Without question, this Inn deserves the awards it has received. Wonderful view of the bay along with a modern and clean atmosphere. The typical included waffle breakfast was a cut above the others I've had.",Good

"This is an excellent location to stay at no matter which park you are visiting. Great rooms, clean and roomy. Our room had couch and kitchen area (sink, cabinets, fridge, and microwave). The nightly rate was more than reasonable.",Good
"Our recent stay at the Whitney was overwhelmingly nice. The hotel is housed in the historic old Whitney Bank Building. The reception desk was once the teller desk and the old vault is located in the lobby. Our suite was very large with two rooms. The master bedroom was quite spacious and was separated from the sitting area by French doors. The sitting area had a sofa bed it's own television. The bathroom was also very spacious. The hotel offers free internet as well as complimentary coffee. There is a restaurant located in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is located right off of Saint Charles Avenue which is very convenient during Mardi Gras and only a half a mile from the French Quarter. I will be staying again!!!On behalf of the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans, thank you for your visit and kind words on TripAdvisor. We hope we'll get another opportunity to serve you again during your next trip to the Big Easy!Kindest Regards, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager",Good
"We stayed here for 3 days the last week of March.I was visiting my cousin in Sierra Vista and we had no idea there was so much to do near here.The staff was very cordial and upbeat ,two free drinks a day beer,wine,soft drinks,water.We missed the free dinner Monday-Thursday but the breakfast was a notch above a continental breakfast eggs,sausage,bacon etc.The rooms all have a stove ,full size fridge and microwave.You must visit Kartchner Caverns if you do nothing else.Bisbee is another side trip for a good walk and great food and its quirky shops and bars.Dear Brian F,Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review! We are very happy that you enjoyed your stay here with us and that you found plenty fun things to do in the area. We appreciate all of your feedback and we hope you get a chance to visit s again soon. Have a wonderful day! J-Ebare",Good
This is by far the best hotel I have stayed at ! Clean ! Best staff in the business !!! Always ready to help ! They go above and beyond from the owner to the cleaning staff. The maintenance team is number one !!!,Good
"Stayed Thanksgiving week 2014 - 2 adults, 2 kids 6 and 12. The hotel is located about 9 miles from Magic Kingdom, 5 miles from Epcot. This is a nice hotel - I can not find any thing negative about this property.Impeccably clean, very well maintained, excellent breakfast service and they do provide a dinner service with beer and wine - what more can you ask for the price you pay This is great value!!Ofcourse, for the nitpickers - the dinner service is not lavish with 13 different options - its a basic dinner and the beer is domestic and wine is house wine - but hey...Nice pool, very attentive front desk staff - like I mentioned earlier, nothing negative to say about this place.",Good
Only small glitch was the breakfast in hotel. Ordered egg which was warm not hotel. Going back there soon so will eat at cafe next door! Hotel quiet and clean. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful. wifi in room great,Good
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room was modern and comfortable. And the location cannot be beat. We were in Chicago for 4 days, and were able to see many sights from Oak Park to Hyde Park. Nothing was more than a 45 minute trip...More",Good
"My hubby and I had a 5 day stay booked at the Best Western Plus French Quarter scheduled from monday 10/29- 11/2 We live in NJ.....guess what happened- HURRICANE SANDY happened. Airline canceled our flight 3 times with me and the hubby now scheduled to fly out of Philadelphia international on thursdays, only to return home on friday. No thanks. Plus there's tons of clean up to do at home. Orbitz contacted Best Western for me and they are willing to refund our entire trip WITHOUT penalties. We will not forget their compassion and plan to re-book our trip at a later date and will DEFINITELY be staying at the Best Western Plus French Quarter. Thanks guys!",Good
"This hotel is right on the boardwalk. You couldn't get any closer to the beach. I had a balcony overlooking the ocean and it was so great. Talk about people watching!! The hotel is not a 5-star hotel, but I couldn't be happier with this place. It also has a pool and hot tub and free breakfast in the morning. Parking was very convenient, right under the hotel.Thank you for your wonderful feedback, we are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay! We look forward to welcoming you back again soon!",Good
"The breakfast is very good! the hotel is clean and safe! Good location near to the highway! The staff is nice! But the internet should be improved. overall, San Diego is very beautiful.

Thank you for your feedback about the Internet- we will look into ways of making sure that guest's don't have any issues with connecting in the future. We hope to see you again the next time you're in the San Diego area! Thank you again!Sincerely,MadisonGuest Relations",Good
"This time was a better visit. They had my reservations for my stay this time. Also, the worker at the front desk remembered me from my last visit. The rooms remain comfortable, however my only hang up is what I would call a design flaw rather than a hotel comfort/staffing issue. The shower heads are not very good, and also the shower door opens into the shower, getting water on the outside of the shower and on the floor just outside the shower. Otherwise a good trip overall.",Good
This hotel was very new and modern. Very clean. Staff friendly. It was clean and is located near the airport. We had a nice water view. There was no shuttle or room service. The counter space in the bathroom is a bit small. But the room had a couch and coffee table in addition the the bed area. That was a plus. We called Uber and got to the airport for 8.50. Not too bad. Would stay again. Cozy pillows and mattress.,Good
"A great welcome to this small, comfortable hotel. We had a nice, good sized room (complete with goldfish). Didn't eat in the restaurant but saw lots of people, mostly local, enjoying what looked like excellent food. They don't do breakfast but there are some good places nearby and they do provide excellent free coffee in the lobby. Overall a pleasant stay and would probably use again if in the area.Thank you for the kind review. We appreciate your support. We hope you can come back for a visit and try our great restaurant. Please tell a friend. Make it an amazing day.",Good
"Clean and comfortablebed was firm and supportive we didnt get to the breakfast but liked having the coffee pot and microwave and fridge in room. Great access to mall easy access to room and parking toilet paper a bit rough/crispyThanks for your comment, and we really appreciate your stay.",Good
"We have visited New Orleans 3 times and have stayed her every time. We like this place because it is in the Quarter but not right in the heart of it. They have parking for your car, but you can walk to anything in the French Quarter. The place was always nice but since our last visit they have remodeled the rooms and are very nice. They have breakfast downstairs every morning and a nice pool in the courtyard. Really the best deal in the French Quarter of New Orleans",Good
"Staff are professional pleasant. Rooms are CLEAN comfortable. Quality breakfast provided, with options for varying diets. The heated indoor pool is well maintained. Floor does get slick though! When travelling to Kingston, NY this is the first Hotel I check for room availability!Thank you for the rating and the wonderful review. We appreciate you sharing your comments on our facility and staff. Great that we are your first choice!! Thanks!",Good
"Clean, neat and outside of downtown Napa. Very affordable with a cute little pool and hot tub.Best bargain I found in all of Napa County. Wonderful Desk Manager and close to a shopping center should you need a little something for your in room refrigerator. Would definitely recommend this Inn and the price is so right.",Good
"We spent the weekend in RB to attend a company reunion. Being the only out of towners we looked to Marriott, specifically Courtyard for the weekend stay. We were surprised by the number of soccer playing youth, with families also at the venue. We were quite happy that there was no running in the halls or bouncing balls that we were aware of. Anyway, we had a very nice suite that overlooked a water feature alive with ducks, and other fowl.The location was perfectly located for ease to the freeway and restaurants. Making for a very enjoyable stay.Dear Joe M,I am glad to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Rancho Bernardo.We hope to see you again very soon.Best Regards, Francesca Suh",Good
"There were some areas great and some were not. We still enjoy the most of them. The location of the hotel was great and very easy access to all amenities. Our best overall service that we were enjoying most was the shuttle drivers. They were very helpful and care a lot to all areas of the service. We all recommended them the best. The second area we enjoyed as well was the dinning in area especially outside. The coffee was great we love it the most too. The service there was great too. Our rooms were good just not much space to move from one end to another but other than that it was okay. The only two areas that we weren't enjoying at all was at the reception area just one receptionist that was very helpful, her attitude was too good at all, she never smile and not helpful too. The other area that we weren't enjoyed was around the all rooms the smoking cannabis it was horrible and very bad, outside where we were staying when open the door we couldn't breath because of the horrible smell as well as people have no respect to other people around.",Good
Eldorado Suites Hotel is the place to stay. It has a great view and a deck with table and chairs to view it. The extra bedroom was perfect when my husband and I took my brother for a couple of days. The staff was gracious and helpful. I would definitely stay there again.,Good
"You can't say enough about the staff! We were first greeted by James, who came out, helped park the car, proceeded to get the luggage out of the trunk with care and take it in to the hotel and up to the room. He was very helpful in getting our room set up for us(a/c, frig, ect.). Working the front desk to check us in was Tori. He checked us in quickly, helped with mapping out points of interest, places to eat and things to do. We also had the pleasure of another front desk personally, Miss Danielle. Just as energetic and helpful as Tori and James. They helped make serveral reservations, ect. for us. There is nothing this staff of friendly, energy packed, helpful, willing to go beyond the norm, caring people will not do to make your stay the best experience possible. Making you feel like family is an asset! Caring about your day, experience, helping you get the best out of your time in New Orleans is what drives them. We can not say enough of the staff, not to mention that the hotel sets in walking destance to WWII Museum, River Walk, and the French Market just to name a few. We give them a 2 THUMBS UP! And we will be back!!!",Good
"I can't say enough about this boutique hotel in the center of all the action. This hotel has been recently updated and it's even cleaner, prettier, and friendlier than it was. Everyone has a smile and is always trying to make your stay perfect. They upgraded us because they knew it was our 40th anniversary. Cassie at the front desk remembered us each day when we entered the lobby. People of all sorts , with pets, with kids, same sex couples, young and old. I love the wonderful mix of incredible people. This is how Chicago should be seen. And you are only steps from the best shopping in town on state street and the best theater in the Midwest. You will feel safe and comfortable and you will return....",Good

"This is an old historic hotel, with the expected creaky floors, but it was also just a little musty and had dirty carpet. If the French Quarter is your scene, but you don't want to be right on the loud vomit-filled Bourbon street then this is a very good choice. The location is on the edge of the Quarter, within easy walking distance of the party, Jackson Square, the French Market, and many great restaurants. Some of the rooms here are very small, while others are quite large. We wanted a balcony, but accidentally booked a sun deck room, which is nothing like a private balcony. The sun deck is a large communal patio with several rooms opening out to it, and it has tall concrete walls with no view, and burning hot sun. This room was very small, with no windows, and so we asked for another room. Even though it was our fault that we booked the wrong type of room the staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating, and they moved us to a room with a balcony - luckily one was available because we were staying during the week and not the weekend. All of the balcony rooms look out over the garden patio, and not the street, but the room was very large and bright. The garden area is small but pleasant, and we did enjoy sitting out there for our morning coffee. The free breakfast here is very minimal - breads, coffee, and cereal, so it is good for a quick bite, but certainly not something to look forward to. One of the best things about this place is the staff. Incredibly friendly and helpful. Everyone is willing to answer questions, and they do it with a smile and without ever acting like they expect a tip. Of course we did tip, and they were always very genuine in their appreciation. We got great recommendations for restaurants within walking distance - one was Irene's, a popular creole restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere, but a very long wait and the other restaurant we enjoyed was Sylvain which is a small funky place with great food. Also within easy waking distance we enjoyed Mr. B's Bistro for lunch, and a glass of wine at the Carousel Bar in the Hotel Monteleone. These are all nice places for sober or semi-sober grown ups, free of loud drunks wearing beads.While the French Quarter was interesting, one day was more than enough for me. It is not the fault of the Bienville House, but the whole Quarter smells of rotting garbage and other unpleasantries. While I enjoy a drink or two, Burbon Street had absolutely no appeal to me, full of 20-somethings walking down the street yelling, carrying their giant beers/drinks, covered in beads, and this starts at 10am. If that is for you, enjoy, but I didn't need more than 10 minutes of that, so if I were ever to return to NOLA I would most definitely stay in the beautiful Garden District - there are many beautiful historic hotels here, and if you stay on or near St. Charles Street you are near the cable street car and can easily get to the Quarter whenever you want. The Garden District also has many excellent restaurants, and is close to Magazine Street, which is where the real shopping is, assuming you want something other than t-shirts with obscene sayings on them.The Bienville House is a nice place, which could use some upgrades, and it is perfect if you want to spend your time in the French Quarter, but somewhat away from the worst of it. We loved the friendly and helpful staff here, and did enjoy many good things within walking distance. However, if non-stop drinking isn't your scene I would recommend looking into the Garden District - much more peaceful and beautiful, and an easy cable car ride to the Quarter when you want it.",Good

"Our room was small but the usage of space was amazing. I was so impressed with the cleanliness, decor and comfort of the room. The location of the hotel was great. We were able to walk to multiple districts (Union Square, SoMa, ChinaTown, North Beach). The hotel staff was very friendly and polite. Great places to eat/drink within a couple of blocks of the hotel. Business center was very nice.",Good
"We arrived late at night after delayed Virgin flight, it was dark and we missed hotel entrance on first try as the sign is not lit up. The rooms are very generous size, 2 double beds, lovely comfortable mattress pillows, all new, the maid service was good, clean towels daily and room cleaned well. We were on the 4th floor, one room looking over the front of hotel the other room facing the pool, the pool view room was a little noisy at night but not a big problem as once it closed all was quiet again.Breakfast was fine, cereals, fruit (oranges, bananas, apples), bread toasters, bagels, scrambled eggs daily, sausages every other day alternating with some sort of porridge with scone like cakes (Americans call them biscuits), packets of porridge to mix yourself, hard boiled cold eggs, cream cheese, jams, muffins cinnamon rolls, orange juice (usual watered down cheap stuff) apple juice water, was ok but the breakfast area was very crowded with tables so when you went to get food drink you always had to squeeze past other people, coffee available all day. The hotel was still undergoing some renovation work on 3rd floor, 4th floor completed amd 5th floor I think was finished, we had a full size fridge in our rooms which was an unexpected bonus, there was also hairdrier iron + ironing board I didnt use them!) Laundry room on ground floor, 1.50 to wash and same to dry, only 2 machines though, not a problem when we were there but it was fairly quiet. The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful, seemed a safe area although we were in a car so didnt walk in the area at all, TGI restaurant nearby Golden Corral, cheapish buffet restaurant. Was concerned as hotel had changed names 3 times since we booked and had gone down the ratings chart but would certainly go to this hotel again. Very handy for Universal, just a few minutes drive and away from I Drive.Thank you for your kind review. Sorry that you had trouble finding us, our entrance sign is now illuminated. Our renovations have been completed and we hope to welcome you back on your next trip to Orlando!",Good
"We stayed at the MO for one week in February whilst the Boat Show, President's Weekend and the Food and Drink Fair were on consequently the hotel was very busy. There is no doubt that the MO is very luxurious, however be careful that you do not end up with a room overlooking the bridge road, as we did initially before they changed it the day after checking in. The hotel is in 3 sections of a curve and one third of the back section looks over this bridge, so ask for either the centre section or the section overlooking the pool. The reception staff vary in their desire to accommodate any disappointments, so if at first you don't succeed, try again with someone else! It is a particular concern that there is a major flight path right over the hotel, which seems quite bad at certain times of the day: the very expensive breakfast on the terrace was somehow marred by this experience, as were our sessions by the pool. I can't believe no one else has commented on this. Regarding the spa, I paid for a rather useless pilates session: like a previous reviewer, the teacher was a sweet girl and I did not like to complain about her, but I had thought the MO spa would ensure that all their staff were excellent in their field. My final negative comment is that the beach was out of bounds more times than not during our stay due to private parties and the time taken to set up these parties: although it did not bother us, I'm sure some people would mind if this was one of the features which attracted them to the hotel.Despite these comments, our family did enjoy our stay!",Good
"While looking for affordable accommodations in this area, I kept finding places that charged extra for parking, which is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback. Hopefully we'll welcome you back soon on your next trip to San Diego.",Good
"This was my first visit to SanDiego and I can see why people describe it as paradise, great weather, friendly people, safe, and walkable.The hotel is in a really good location, 10 minutes from the airport, 3 blocks to the bay and 1 block to little Italy.Check in was quick and easy and front desk staff friendly and helpful. The room was small but adequate with a balcony, fridge, comfortable bedding and beds. We also had a limited bay view. While there is a lot of construction going on, it was not distracting.Breakfast was in a restaurant down the street from the hotel. Hot and cold choices were plentiful and the service excellent.My only complaint is the condition of the carpet. It was very stained and really should be replaced (room 609).Thank you for choosing to stay with us while visiting San Diego! It is great to learn about your stay and how much you enjoyed the area. Thank you for letting us know about the carpet in your room so we may address it and we appreciate your feedback about the easy and quick check in. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for another stay!",Good

Stayed at the Marriott for one night to go to the United Center for the Mary J Blige Concert. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. We dined in the hotel and ate handcrafted burgers and fries that was very delicious.The most accommodating part of our stay was the shuttle to and from the United Center. The driver drove us directly to the entrance of the stadium. The concert let out at 12pm and the driver was waiting or us!!!! The shuttle normally only runs until 9pm I believe but if they have guests that are attending an event the offer shuttle service too then they will stay available until the event is over. That is very accommodating for someone who may not have driven to the hotel or wants to avoid parking fees. The hotel was clean and very welcoming. The staff was very friendly and talkative too.,Good

"Paying 25.00 a day for parking seem ridiculous for parking spaces that could not fit a standard size car. Having to park to one side of the parking lane and still having to squeeze out of the car is not acceptable. This was the only disappointment in our stay. The rooms were clean and nice and comfortable with all amenities except for microwave. We wanted to reheat food that we had in the refrigerator but discovered no microwave in the room.Dear Guest, Thank you for writing a review of your stay in New Orleans.

"I have stayed at his hotel many times since 2005 it just gets better better. Check in is super easy, valet parking is great, and now the new evening meal is a wonderful addition to their already great breakfast. We stayed in room 830, in the new addition on 7-23 with my niece her 4 young children. This was a king suite with a roll away bed, we had a great nights sleep. This room has a view of the pool. We all enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed the evening meal the breakfast before going to the Aquarium the next day.",Good

"Gorgeous room, friendly and welcoming staff, immaculately clean, great value, and joyous attention to detail are just a few of the attributes that come to mind about the Orchard Garden Hotel. Our first interaction with the staff started when we popped out of the Montgomery BART Station but were unsure which direction to start walking to get to the hotel. A quick phone call to the front desk put us in touch with a genuinely caring and competent ambassador for the hotel who stayed on the line with us until we were clearly on the right path. Once we arrived (seven hours too early for check in), two friendly and helpful front desk attendants went into action to serve us. They carefully listened to our room preferences and put their play into motion. There were no rooms immediately available, but they credibly assured us they could match us with the perfect room for us. They gave us several great ideas for sights to take in before our room was ready (fantastic suggestions that caused the time to evaporate). When we we returned, WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!Our room exactly matched the criteria we discussed. The room was a contemporary design that was sparkling clean! The sofa was a comfortable place to plop down after eight glorious hours of sightseeing (on foot). San Francisco's sights, vistas, and hills were captivating. The room had so many things that demonstrated careful attention to detail. Examples included: illuminated light switches that are easy to find in the dark, a clock-radio with a built-in iPhone connector AND USB port for charging a headset or watch, and an automatic light that comes on inside the closet when the closet door is opened. We have stayed in several beautiful San Francisco hotels over the years for business. But from here forward, the Orchard Garden Hotel will be our FIRST CHOICE when visiting San Francisco! Thanks to the staff and management for an awesome experience. You have made us customers for life!I'm thrilled that our staff were able to take such good care of you. We know that traveling can be tiring, so we take care of everything for you down to the smallest detail -- I'm glad you appreciated those built in iPhone connectors! We look forward to receiving you and your traveling companions again on your next trip to San Francisco. Safe travels,Collins C., Front Office Manager",Good
"This hotel was recently renovated and they did an awesome job. Updated and modern yet welcoming and comfortable. Since I was there on business I didn't use the pool or work out facility, but the bar and restaurant is fantastic...everyone is super friendly. Walking distance to an amazing Italian restaurant and gas station for quick provisions if need be. Thumbs up!Dear Kara M C,Thank you for your kind words and feedback, we truly appreciate all of your comments! I am pleased to hear that you like the new design of our remodel and that you were able to enjoy our restaurant/bar as well as the nearby provisions. We hope that you decide to return for another visit any time you are in the area! We would love to become one of your usual places when your commute brings you down to San Diego!Sincerely,Sammie",Good
"As a Miami native who comes back and visits 2-3 times a year, staying at the Mandarin Oriental Miami was a magical experience. They were able to get me to forget about terrible Miami traffic and attitudes. My entire stay I didn't have a care in the world because I knew their staff was already a step ahead of me, anticipating my needs. The Mandarin Oriental Miami was an incredible selection for our wedding stay. Our groomsmen got ready there the day of our wedding and by the time we returned that evening, the staff had cleaned up the room. This was especially great because we had given the groomsmen gifts in wooden crates (mancrates.com) and the staff made sure to get rid of all of them. They were always kind, courteous, friendly, and helpful. Valet always asked if we needed help with instructions, helped with bags, and told us about calling for your car before heading down. In-room dining was fantastic. We decided to have in-room breakfast on our final morning there. They arrived on time, set up a beautiful table by the window which even had a fresh rose on it, and rearranged furniture for the best setup. Turndown service was a delight. Coming home every night to slippers by the bed and a note with weather info for the next day was such a nice touch. We ordered champagne our first night in and were so tired we didn't get around to drinking it. Every day they refilled our champagne bucket with fresh ice during housekeeping so we always had the option to crack it open. The pool and hot tub were clean and a perfect temperature. The poolside bar had attentive and respectful service. They leave you with a button you can use to call them over. They also passed around fresh smoothie samples about once an hour. The room was spacious, clean, and modern. We stayed in one of their Dynasty Suites, which felt like being in an apartment. There was even a half bath in the living area which helped when at one point we had 8 men in the suite.",Good
"I highly recommend this hotel. I booked a weekend here for my sisters and I as we wanted to shop at connecting Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza across the street and to use the spa services from DASS Salon. We preferred to stay in Buckhead at an upscale hotel and this hotel fit the bill. The front desk and the concierge services were very helpful to us as far as getting us into restaurants. One of the staff gave us wrong information about the length of a Taxi cab ride to one of the restaurants, which ended up costing us three times what he said it would. The Valet staff did arrange for us to be driven to Phipps Plaza and back because it was raining one afternoon. Our rooms were very clean, comfortable and nicely furnished. We were at the end of the hall on the tenth floor (great views) with two connecting rooms and our own separate entrance/hallway. The Sunday breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant was delicious and the service was excellent. Of course, we were tipping left and right but it was well worth it. Everything from check in to check out and in-between went smoothly. The snack/coffee shop in the hotel was top notch, you could get everything from bandaids to a danish. When I got home, I realized I left my phone charger. I called the hotel and they put me in touch with the Loss Prevention staff. They recovered my charger and sent it to me overnight at no charge.",Good
I came in for a wedding and wanted to be in the heart of it all. It is a beautiful place and I shall return. The hotel was pricey for the amount of space and amenities but the I enjoyed everything else. Will return for a longer stay with friends to explore more and do more!,Good
"Have stayed here twice, and definite improvements were made since the first time. Full hot breakfast, awesome location, great service. Stay during the middle of the week to avoid the weekend upcharges, and become a BW member so you get the free parking!I'm glad to read you were pleased with the changes that have been made at the hotel! Coming during the middle of the week is a great tip. It is less crowded, but there is still always something going on in the city!Also, parking is always included in our rate whether a guest is a Best Western Rewards member or not, but thank you for becoming a member! Thank you for reviewing your stay, and we will see you the next time you visit New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager",Good
"We were in Prosser for a wine event, and the Best Western was full. The Barn (now called the Vintner's Lodge) was just fine. Clean and quiet, close to downtown. Front desk clerk was friendly. We had a room with 2 queens. Hairdryer, shampoo, but no conditioner. They have an outdoor pool between the hotel and bar next door, and... More",Good
"Stayed for one night at this property because of its proximity to my meeting the next day. The lobby was clean, bright and well lit. The rooms were also clean and large. I was a bit dismayed at the price but I stayed anyway. The room rate was higher than other nearby hotels.",Good
Very modern and welcoming hotel. This will be my go to hotel when traveling to the greater ATL area. Staff was helpful and the location was perfect. Loved how clean and inviting my room was. Thank you,Good
"The Chablis Inn is a decent little place. Any hotel review in Napa requires you keep your perspective. Napa is one of those places where 300+ a night rooms are common. My room was about 100 (Motel 6, next door, was about 20 less). The room was small, clean, with a mini fridge and microwave. Everything worked. Beds average for comfort. Dog friendly at 25 per dog per night empty lot on side of hotel to walk them. One of the best dog parks in California, Alston Park, is a 5 minute car ride away. Starbucks just across the street. Hot tub not used but looked very clean. On the downside, you could hear creaking with every step of the person in the room above. Old non-flat panel tv with limited channels. Room heater a bit noisy. Convenient but busy location. Would stay here again.Booking note: While waiting to check in I overheard part of a conversation regarding some kind of problem with the room/reservation with another guest. The management was responding by telling the guest they couldn't do anything about the issue since they had booked thru a third party. The you didn't pay us, you paid them line. I see this more and more these days with hotels, airlines, etc. It seems to be a technique to encourage people to book directly with the business. I am not saying the Chablis Inn is a bad guy here I don't know the specifcs. I am just pointing out the general issue of how one books travel and how it affects you if there is a problem.I appreciate all of the positive information that you shared. We continue to upgrade our property and addressing the T.V's and programming offered is currently being reviewed.The guest issue was unfortunate. The guest had purchased a voucher as part of a promotion that was non-refundable. The guest did stay for the duration of the promotion and enjoyed the stay and all of her promotional package.

"We took a detour from North Louisiana on our anniversary weekend-forgetting that it was also St. Patrick's Day! We ended up in New Orleans and enjoyed touring many familiar and favorite neighborhoods. We made our way slowing down Magazine Street close to where we onced lived and realized that a St. Patrick's Day parade was wrapping up! Desperate to find accommodations my husband walked into the Drury Inn on Poydras St. and booked the last room of the hotel.The lobby was lively with happy hour and we enjoyed a quick glass of wine before going to our room on the first floor! We were amazed at the quality and comfort considering the low price we were offered! ( Ask for those military and senior discounts.) The staff was courteous and friendly, the room quiet and comfortable! The inn is close to the quarter and cost a mere 6 for a friendly cab ride! We were dropped off right at the start of the parade on Bourbon St and enjoyed a after-parade drink in another hotel on Canal. We were fortunate to meet the Grand Marshall's family and enjoy their story of life in and around New Orleans! Parking is extra but well worth the price and peace of mind knowing your car is being cared for in an off-site location.",Good

"My husband and I arrived a day early for our cruise to Alaska. I tried to find a centralized hotel where everything would be within walking distance of the hotel. We were greeted outside the hotel by very friendly hotel staff. The simple expression by the hotel staff to greet me by my name is well worth my visit. The hotel room was clean and very comfortable. The bell hop made it a point to go over everything in our room, give us his name and make a quick get away. The hotel was in a perfect place to walk Pikes Place, the Space Needle and all the shopping venues around the hotel. The martini bar around the corner offered some really good Bloody Mary's and buffet breakfast. Very impressed by the hotel.",Good

"I got a very good deal online for this hotel and was really happy. The suite was massive, very clean and well set out and although i was in one of the rooms near the highway, i hardly heard it at all. On some reviews i had read that it was a little out of the way, but i found the walk into the main downtown area quick and easy, about 15 minutes and it is very close to the greyhound and the public transport to the airport. Breakfast was simple but effective, but it is rare to get it at all with deals so i was very happy with this too. Staff were helpful and friendly and i would stay here again if i got the same rate of 150 for sure.",Good

"Very nicely appointed small room, but acceptable lodging for the price when spending the day away from the Motel wine tasting. Very small outdoor swimming pool (probably smallest out door pool have ever seen -- even smaller than indoor pool at Best Western Plus in Albany, Oregon -- another guest had stayed many times at this Motel for business, and commented he had never seen anyone in the pool. But, when there to dine and visit wineries without children, swimming pool irrelevant. But families with children who want to play in the pool, or adults that want to swim some laps be advised that this is not the Motel swimming pool for you. Good, adequate complimentary breakfast (2 choices) with coffee or tea at Denny's next door. Had not experienced this arrangement before, and was certainly nicer and more convenient than the 5.00 credit given by Adelaide Inn in Paso Robles, CA, at expensive for breakfast restaurant located two blocks away from Motel.Thank you for your review. Yes our pool is on the small side, but we have a large area to lounge and soak up the sun. We are glad you enjoyed our arrangement with Denny's for our rewards members.",Good
"We had 2 nights here in November and had a lovely time. Staff were very friendly, hotel clean and modern, bed very comfortable. We didn't eat here, but plenty of diners and restaurants near by.Location for shopping in Union square was great, Macys was a 5 minute walk away. We walked to fisherman's Warf on the first day but wouldn't recommend it as it was quite a hike and not particularly scenic, the cab back was around 20.We travelled to the hotel early on a Friday morning by Bart, the ticket was around 8 each from the airport and th Bart station was approx. 10 mins walk to the hotel, but our return flight was late at night so we used the hotel airport shuttle with I think was around 38 for the 2 of us, great service.",Good
"Has a great time. Nice secluded pool and room was quiet as requested. The kitchenette was well stocked and all utensils were clean and ready to go. Good location for freeway to galleria, Frisco, airport and shopping and restaurants at Addison. Friendly reception staff helped and breakfast was acceptable. We had a great visit. Thank you for taking time to write a review. We appreciate the kind words and hope to see you again.",Good
"This hotel was very quaint, as it is in one of the older buildings. Rooms are a bit small, since it is an older building. The price was good, especially considering the location is right in the French Quarter. The maid service left a little to be desired, as it appeared they did very little in the way of vacuuming. Would still consider staying here again though, as the concierge and front desk service was very good.Hi David, thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your valuable feedback. Our hotel typically receives high marks from guests for our housekeeping service, and we apologize that our staff missed their mark with your stay - please know that all of your comments have been passed on to management and are being addressed. We're glad you enjoyed your time with us in New Orleans, and look forward to welcoming you back soon!",Good
"Checked in late Easter evening, and was treated great despite the late holiday hour. The hotel is in a good location, just a few minutes from Uptown and downtown, also continent to Lovefield airport. The lobby looks recently renovated.

This hotel is well located with an easy walk (15 minutes) to the French Quarter and on the trolley line. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Service personnel are very gracious and helpful. Small coin laundry on the second level. Hot breakfast and snacks in the afternoon as well as popcorn and pop available in the lobby until 10pm. The only caveat is that the street side rooms are quite noisy as the trolley line passes on the street outside and seemed to run all night.,Good

"Lodging is expensive in New Orleans, but this place offers everything at a reasonable price. It's located on the edge of the French Quarter, so you can be in the action on Bourbon Street after a five minute walk. And when it's time to come home, you can get away from the action to relax in the peace and quiet of your hotel room. We were delighted to get upgraded to a suite, but really did not spend much time in the room taking advantage of the hot tub or other amenities. There is so much to see and do in town and the tour buses will pick up visitors right at the front door of the hotel. A nice bar is available for a leisurely drink and a free breakfast is offered featuring a variety of the usual fare. Parking is hard to come by in town, but it's available on site for hotel guests (for a nightly fee). The staff is exceptional, so just let them know if you have any questions about the area or need some recommendations.",Good

We stayed here last year and plan to return soon. We had a three night stay and it was great. Very relaxing--room on second floor overlooking the water. Front desk staff was courteous and helpful when suggesting places to visit and food choices.,Good
"As someone who is used to staying in standard hotel rooms, this was a different ending joinable experience for me me. This small hotel is located in the town of Cape Charles. It is a place where there is nothing much to do and we were there for a wedding. The reservation process was quite easy and we were surprised... More",Good
"I must say that I've never stayed in a SpringHill Suites before and I must say it was a pleasant experience! Everything from the staff to the rooms were clean and refreshing. The staff was more than helpful when it came to different things to do in the area. The only downside that I didn't like is that it's not necessarily in the heart of downtown Seattle. We did have to do a bit of walking, but the hotel more than made up for that. Would definitely stay here again.",Good

"My sister, niece and I stopped in for dinner during her 21st birthday trip. First, let me say the staff made our night! Our server Jesse had some great tips on visiting San Diego and was so friendly and efficient! The busser Carter was equally friendly and helpful he helped situate our chairs over by the fire for after dinner cocktails, also by the pool! Together they were about the best I've encountered. Our delicious dinners were served poolside while a James Bond movie played on the big screen and Bond music played in the background. We felt like we were in the sixties in a Bond movie in a good way! Everything was very chic and cool but also very inviting. It was also 1/2 price wine night so it was just a perfect evening. I would recommend a stop here to anyone looking for a unique dining experience. I hear the rooms are also nice but unfortunately we did not stay here.Thank you for taking the time to leave a positive review. We greatly appreciate your support! Our staff are rockstars and so glad you enjoyed their excellent service. The movie night are really fun. Hope you can return for a stay in one of our rooms. Make it a great day.",Good

"I stayed here a year ago and loved it. I plan on staying again this summer too. The parking fee is high but is all over New Orleans in the Quarter. Very friendly and helpful desk staff. The room is old NOLA style but comfortable. The location is great, walking distance to most things in the Quarter. Close to WWII museum which I highly recommend as well. Only breakfast is coffee and croissant but I was going to get beignets anywayDear HeatherJ144,Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback out your stay and time here at the St. James Hotel.

"Nothing's perfect, but whenever things are good, we certainly have to admit they are and recommend them to other people. My wife and I were traveling with my sister, brother in law and two young nephews, and everyone loved it. We stayed four days and they stayed almost two weeks!Before we booked this hotel, we had already paid for another one, which we cancelled when read more updated reviews about it, which actually were awful. Then started our haunt againg and found this nice hotel, with very spacious and comfortable suites, which all the time were spotless and well kept. I've stayed in Best Westerns, Holiday Inns, Hilton and many other chains, but this being my first experience with Homewood, really was surprising. So PROS: great spacious rooms, nice breakfast (don't believe the reviews that say other things we loved them), clean, convenient parking and location, staff.Few CONS: the unfriendly front desk lady who was there when we first came in. Though she chaged a little after that, she wasn't as friendly as the rest. The rooms that face the Highway are a bit noisy (tried one before getting onether one), though nothing really bad. Just ask for a non-highway one.I'd go back to this hotel and would recommend this chain over the other conventional ones, and they're almost at the same price range... Great stay!",Good
"I stayed at Hilton Garden Inn for a 3 day Sales Seminar and had a very pleasant and comfortable stay. The friendly staff, clean room and overall property look made me feel quite at home. I wished I could have stayed a few more days to enjoy all the amenities even more. I will definitely return to Hilton Garden Inn in the near future. KindlyThank you for your complimentary words regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport.

Clean and fresh rooms, amazing location, great Central Park views (Central Park View rooms only), 5 Star service at every turn. I love this hotel. Unlike The Four Seasons Central Park (57th St), this is a true 5 Star experience. You cannot go wrong here!",Good
"Very convenient location--took the Link in from SEA, and the stop was just a couple blocks away. Check in was quick and painless, and they gave me an upgrade per my Globalist (ugh, it pains me each time I type that) status to a corner suite. It was on the back side of the hotel (away from the Sound view), but it was a spacious room with the necessary accoutrements. The bed was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The club had a better spread than some other locations, and ample seating. Otherwise as far as restaurant outlets in the hotel, they had a Ruth's Chris (didn't go) and a deli/convenience store. There's a bunch of places within walking distance though, covering all types of cuisine, and it's very easy to get to the tourist attractions not too much of a jaunt to Safeco Field either.Would definitely recommend.",Good
"The new Westin Nanea is the absolute best vacation resort . It has all the amenities you would ever need ,we stayed 2 weeks and loved every minute. We had free DAILY housekeeping,the housekeeper would come to our door every morning to ask when it would be best to do our room. They do an exceptional job and a big shout out for Karen, she is sweet, polite and does an excellent job replenishing kitchen and bathroom supplies when needed.Every person that works on the resort from cleaning staff ,restaurant servers to front desk personelle are terrific!We thoroughly enjoyed every part of being at the Nanea....relaxing at the beautiful pool, walking the boardwalk,whale watching right from along the front of the resort, walking to a grocery store,The Times, to our day excursions in our rental car. Everything on the island is usually an hour or less drive.All I can say is breath taking,absolutely the most beautiful spot on earth!!! Loved it there and hope to return!Thanks Westin NaneaAloha Linda123645,Mahalo for your review! Our villas do come well stocked with everything you could possibly need to make your stay comfortable.

Stayed here while I was taking my ABEM oral boards which are given on the 6th-8th floors of the hotel so location was really convenient. 7 min free shuttle ride from O'Hare was nice. Facility itself is dated but very well kept and almost everything has been updated. Breakfast is 19 for buffet but very good. Decent workout facility. Walking distance to a couple diners (and Gino's East) but other than that you need to find a ride.,Good
"Fantastic location near Union Square with easy access and travel options. Room decor is very tasteful and housekeeping are doing a wonderful job.

"1. Got a great deal for a stay at The Galleria on Expedia ,so grabbed it .2. SF is all about location nothing beats if your centrally located , close to BART, MuNI stops , cable car , eateries , shopping hub !!3. Staff is very prompt tourist friendly .. Phone requests for pillows toiletries were honoured in matter of minutes.4. They offer complimentary wine hours in the evening at the hotel lobby coffee in the morning.5. The premises are spotless clean which makes it very much kid friendly ( I was staying with a 20 month old ).6. Check in Check out was done ridiculously quick , which always earns a brownie point !7. The Seven Eleven located next door will take care of all the breakfast , savory, daily water, etc requirements for an ordinary family traveller.8. Although i read some great reviews about their next door neighbourhood cafe Bread Cocoa , i didn't at all enjoy the food.9.We got a twin bed room as a part of the deal it more than sufficed our requirements even with a toddler in tow ! Need more luxury , check in at Hyatt or Hilton.. I have read travellers cribbing about room size in reviews.. No idea why ! You get what you pay . Period.10. They support the Go Green initiative for each day of no linen change ,a complimentary bottled water is offered to guests.11. All toiletries are Jonathan Adler products . Need i say more ) 12.

"We had a wonderful time at the Estancia La Jolla. We had never stayed there before, and it was so great. As we arrived they offered us sparkling wine and water, took us to our room which was lovely, and showed us around. We took advantage of the free arrival margaritas, as low point, as I think they forgot the tequila!, but it was a nice offer. We also used the jacuzzi which was clean and nice in the evening with candles and a fire in the pool area. Everyone was super friendly, and the facilities were great, although they were being re-modeled at the time, which wasn't the best. We ate at Adobe El Restaurante for breakfast which was absolutely delightful. We would definitely recommend a visit to this charming hotel.Thank you for taking the time to write such a fantastic review. Im glad you had a chance to enjoy things like the whirlpool and breakfast in Adobe El Restaurante. You will have to come back and visit the Spa next time, it is going to look great after the enhancement project is complete in just a couple more weeks!",Good
"Our family of four (2 adults, 2 kids) stayed here while in town for a family visit. We found the location of the hotel to be convenient, as we went into the city, and out to the southwestern suburbs. Check-in went very smoothly and the staff was very courteous. We found our room to be very clean and the bed was comfortable. We heard some cars drag racing late at night, but did not hear any of the airplane traffic from the nearby airport. We had the continental breakfast and we were happy with it. Our only disappointment came on the second night of our stay. The pool was shut down because of a broken pump. That was a little disappointing for the kids, as they had swam the night before and had a good time, but, those things happen... Overall, we had a nice stay.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. We accept any and all feedback in a positive manner! Yes, I am extremely sorry for the inconvenience. We also needed to ensure the chemical levels were at the right levels before opening it back up. Thank you for your understanding. We would love another opportunity to serve you again in the future!Yours in hospitality,Paulette MooreGeneral Manager",Good
"High points The Allegro hotel is like going back in time. The lobby is beautifully restored art Deco with modern amenities. Fireplace is wonderful and there are multiple seating areas. Staff is friendly, attentive and efficient. Rooms are spacious, small bathrooms but excellent water pressure in shower. Beds and pillows excellent. Hotel robes are luscious. Low point:Virtually no closet since it is about 6 inches deep and clothes must hang sideways.Extra points Complimentary bubbly in lobby in afternoon!Thanks for the great review!

We spent a night here on a cross country trip and it was a very nice Best Western. We didn't arrive until almost 10 PM and it was easy check in and we were asked if we wanted a room on the 1st or second floor. We were driving a U-Haul and pulling a trailer so it was nice to... More,Good
"Stayed one night while traveling summer, 2015. The staff was friendly. Complimentary breakfast was the typical selection. Breakfast area was small.

"Great charm and character inside the building . Room 252 has a balcony 2 queen beds, feature open brickwork and views of the Mississippi paddle steamers. The street cars, train bus tours all leave from across the road. No breakfast or any food is available in the hotel but there are many cafes within a few yards. There is a quiet courtyard and a small plunge pool. The room is right over the road, so you get view, but some noise too, mNy from the paddle steamer which plays an organ type calliope tune several times a day. Train noise traffic at night, so bring your ear plugs. Helpful staff. I would stay here again, its so central to Jackson square, Frenchman street, the river etc.Hi Jackie, we're glad you enjoyed your stay.

"We were in San Diego for the Hot Chocolate Run, we just needed a room for one night and left early in the morning. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were nice, but a bit on the small side. The location was good, nothing in walking distance though. We didn't get a chance to have breakfast, so no review on that. Overall a nice place to stay at a decent price and in a good location.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to write a review.

"My wife and I spent two nights at this gorgeous hotel recently while visiting Atlanta for a Braves game and, of course, for shopping (you can walk indoors to huge Lenox Square from this hotel). Our room was immaculate and beautifully furnished and equipped, but the thing that really stood out was the staff. Every single employee we encountered was friendly and helpful, and seemed determined to help us have a terrific stay. We will definitely be back.Thank you for recognizing our staff for their service during your recent stay. I am blessed to have so many dedicated associates that love providing outstanding service to our guests. I'm glad to hear that you were able to get to a Braves game and do some shopping in the Lenox Mall which is connected to our hotel. It's a great way to spend a few days while in Atlanta. We look forward to having you return again soon.",Good
"The hotel itself might be old, but the good thing is they provide everything needed.I assume the major upgrade they went through was the TV in the room as compared with other stuff such as furnitures the only thing that looks new is the TV.Given the rate that I paid, it is a spacious room that is bigger than I thought.",Good
"We spent 12 nights at this BW. The first night, the A/C unit was like a Mack truck idling inside the room. We asked the front desk next morning for a fix or a room change. Within an hour or so, maintenance was checking out the problem and told us they would replace the unit. When we returned that night, it appeared to be a new unit and was blissfully quiet (well, as quiet as those things get). Nice job!Breakfast was crowded a couple of times but mostly OK. Selection was good - the usual waffle makers, cereal, fruit, pastries, bread, muffins, yogurt, small hot buffet - varied parings of scrambled eggs, omelets, sausage, potatoes (and inexplicably once, baked beans). Decent quality and efficiently maintained.The room was clean and quiet (some traffic noise in the morning). There were elephants upstairs but we never heard their voices. Biggest negative would be parking. There is simply not enough of it and it is packed tighter than an Olympian's spandex. Still, we always found a spot SOMEWHERE, even in the spots by the front entrance marked 15 minute parking only. The front desk acknowledged that was OK. Overall, this was a very decent value for the price and I would have no qualms about returning.Dear Steve7028Thank you for your feedback regarding your stay at the Best Western San Diego Miramar.

"3 night stay during MLB All-star weekend. Originally opted for the Westin Gaslamp property, but this was 3 blocks further west and rates were better so opted for this choice. Not disappointed. Ocean views from 19 floor room, comfortable Westin beds, and nice lobby bar. 15 minute walk to Petco Park and easily found street parking within 1 block of hotel each evening, which was surprising for the downtown location. Will stay again when in town. Pool and fitness center were a bit disappointing from Westin standards. Complimentary Wi-fi for SPG members, otherwise paid.hvlewfamily - I am pleased to read you found our location to be convenient to all the festivities for the All Star Baseball events. It is unfortunate to hear you didn't enjoy our outdoor pool, Jacuzzi and sun deck. This area is open from 6am to 10pm daily with views of downtown and the bay. Our WestinWORKOUT Fitness Studio is open 24 hours a day and recently we added several new pieces of equipment (bikes, leg machines and an ab machine).

"We stayed here because there was a group on and I am a Mariott Rewards Elite member, AND I have stayed at MANY residence inn's across the US.This was a great location, right off the expressway and MINUTES away from most things in Dallas. We arrived and there was a little confusion on our room, but it was fixed, we were put into a one bedroom suite as we had reserved that had a door (we brought kids with us) and that fixed the problem, the night staff was very accommodating to our request.Breakfast was good, had a nice selection (basic eggs, sausage, OJ, Milk, Cereal, Waffles etc) ONE tip I could give the hotel is GET ANOTHER WAFFLE MAKER! Everyone LOVED the texas shaped waffles but had to wait forever to make one since there was just one of them! They also serve a dinner type meal M-Tu-Wed, which while we didn't get to try is a nice perk for business travelers watching their expense accounts.I read some other reviews and can say that while this isn't a 2014 newly built property it really is in great shape, wear and tear here and there but nothing that was really out of the ordinary from other hotels, there were no stains on the floors, no holes in walls, doors worked great, the noise outside the halls and outside were nothing bad and no weird smells!The pool was a little highly chlorinated and I think someone might have just not known how much to really put in, but it was a heated pool and the hot tub wasn't working at the time, but keep in mind that it was 40 degrees the day before and just into the mid 60's so I am sure it was just opening season.Also one tip I would say is bring your own pillows if you can, I did read on another review where someone said the pillows were small, yes they are and hard! The beds were comfortable but I would recommend the hotel upgrade and replace all those little tiny rocks (pillows).I think the front desk pulls double duty for housekeeping as a few requests that we requested never happened like an extra blanket and a few towels brought to our room but I could tell the front desk staff was working their hardest so I let it slide and just dealt with it. Over all we had a very nice stay, and this is a property I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay, centrally located and with a nice friendly staff.Thank you so much for the kind and generous words. We appreciate your high praise for our staff and hotel. We are always looking for ways to improve our offerings. Currently we are finishing our exterior updates, including new gardens. Please join us again soon, we are very family friendly. The concerns you provided have also been addressed. Thank you so much. Lynn Martin, General Manager",Good

"I live within an hour of New Orleans, so I go often. I have stayed in many hotels. The Drury Inn became my go-to hotel. But it has been a while since I stayed overnight in NOLA. My last Drury review, the hotel was the greatest thing since man canned beer. But upgrades have knocked it down a notch. First the positives: it is about 4 blocks off of the French Quarter. So certainly close enough to walk in a couple minutes, but far enough away that it is quiet. You can actually sleep when you are ready. The breakfast is awesome with eggs, grits (real creamy grits), sausage, waffle makers, plus, plus. The 5pm kick back includes 3 free drinks and enough real food to count as dinner. While you have to eat at some NOLA restaurants to get the full NOLA experience, free breakfast and free dinner easily can save you 100 a day as a couple, making the trip more affordable. The rooms are updated, clean and comfortable.My only negative is the updates. They used to have free self parking. Now there is ONLY 28 a day for valet parking. Don't rent a car if you are flying in. The city is very walkable. But when you drive in like me, it really ups the cost. Then the convenience of the valet parking is negated by the very poor management of the process. You can not call down from your room to have your car pulled up front like any other hotel. You have to come down in person. For most of my stay there was only 1 guy around. He was fetching other cars and it took forever to get ours. Same thing when you return to the hotel. No one around, and you may wait 20-30 minutes to drop off your car. Frustrating to say the least. I would have MUCH, MUCH rather self parked.Thanks for your recent stay with us, and the kind words about the hotel and its offerings. Also, thanks for feedback on the parking. As you noted, we do only have valet parking now and it is at a fee. I was not aware of free parking in the past, but did some digging and found that in 2010, when construction on the addition began and during your last stay, free parking was offered. Also, please know that we do allow for call down for car retrieval as long as it is not raining or a large check-out. I will get with the valet team, and repeat that these are the only periods when guests are asked to come down. We look forward to seeing you again,Patrick D. General Manager",Good

It's a very nice and clean hotel. It's located in a very nice area. The rooms are very clean and the staff is friendly. I would definitely stay there again. I had a really good experience since it was my first time staying at Best Western,Good

"We stayed here for two nights in September. Other hotels were extortionate at this time of year with 30-40 per night car parking. The Columbus Motor Inn was a reasonable rate for this popular city and also had free car parking.The room was large, well furnished, quiet, clean and comfortable and the location was good. The neighbourhood felt safe and it is withing walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf.",Good
"Adorable little place, 2 blocks from the beach and from the center of town. Nothing fancy, but clean, friendly and they allow dogs! Nice kitchenette's that would make it a great place for an extended stay.",Good
"There are not enough superlatives to describe the French Market Inn. The desk and bell staff were friendly and extremely helpful. The inn is centrally located in the French Quarter within easy walking distance of Bourbon Street (one big dive), Frenchman Street (with the great food and live music that made the French Quarter famous), and the amazing World War II Museum. Public transportation (buses and trolleys) made it unnecessary to use our car to visit the many local sites. When we did need the car, the valet service was prompt and efficient.The quaint inn features a large, private courtyard with tables and a small swimming pool. Our third-floor room was large and very comfortably furnished. It looked out over Decatur Street and the park along the Mississippi River. Despite what could have been a noisy location, the room was very quiet except for a single train that passed by during the early evening hours each day. The room included a digitally controlled heat pump for perfect temperature control. The beds were very comfortable.I will definitely stay at the French Market Inn if I ever return to New Orleans.",Good
"We stayed at this location as the first stop of our road trip to Chattanooga via Memphis, Nashville Gatlinburg .There were nine of us we had five rooms, everyone was more than happy with their accommodation , all five rooms were clean ,fresh well maintained, we were made to feel very welcome at check in.The location could hardly be better for Downtown Atlanta, an easy walk, a big bonus was free city parking a couple of oversize parking bays (plenty of room even for our 15 seat van)WIFI was fast, air con worked great, no noise problems, all in all 10/10 especially at the very reasonable rate for a clean city centre room with free parking, thanks for a great stay !",Good

"I stayed in this hotel with a group of 50 high school students. The staff was friendly, organized, and made the check-in process super easy, considering the size of my group. The were accommodating to all of our needs, even setting up a section of bus parking for us. The staff was also respectful to my students, which is not always the case. Many times hotels only address the adults, but Robbie took it upon himself to make sure they were comfortable.",Good
"We had an amazing stay here, but I must say the spa was perfect. We did a 2 hour suite couples massage. It was just what we needed after a long day. Giselle Sonia asked what we wanted and they completed and connected with all of our needs. We can't wait to do it all over again thank you",Good

"The St. James is a wonderful little boutique hotel in a spectacular location of New Orleans. My wife I recently stayed there over our wedding weekend, and we were treated fantastically by the staff - setting us up with a particularly nice King Suite during our stay, and just generally making us feel as though we were truly at home. Can't say enough about the staff and how friendly, pleasant and accommodating they were - in particular, Ariael, Christina, Amy Michelle (and the list goes on and on). Although it was a relatively short stay, it was a pleasure to feel like we truly welcomed by the staff there. And a tip for future guests, if you can convince Ariael to sing for you, you're in for a real treat - she broke out some John Legend for us on our wedding night, and we were absolutely blown away!",Good

"I do quite a bit of travelling and this has to be one of the best value one can get for Seattle. Perfect for families or extended business travel. An excellent staff that aims to please, a downtown location, extra large rooms, and the better than average breakfast....you can't go wrong.Staff. Each and everyone sent their best with a greeting: all the valets, each and every front desk clerk, 2 house persons, and the breakfast staff. Service is top notch and this means management is doing a great job.Large Rooms. The suite had an extra large living room with a sofa that can seat four. A small kitchenette was equipped with a frig and a microwave oven. The bathroom set up was convenient as the sink is outside the bath for functionality. The queen bed was firm and I had the best sleep of the entire week. It is downtown so you have the usual downtown noise but I did not find it bothersome.Downtown location. Convenient freeway access. It is literally a turn and a stop light away from the on ramp to I-5. Across the street was a Subway restaurant and 24 Hour Fitness. Across the corner was a good size Starbucks. Within 5 to 10 minute walk are your downtown selection of cafes, thai food, pizza places and more.Breakfast. I think this property offered just little bit more than the competition when it came to selection. You have 2 types of scrambled eggs, 3 types of meat (Canadian bacon, sausage, and ham), a wider selection of pastries, a few types of breads, oatmeal and cereal, multi juice dispenser, jams/jellies. I was also able to build a cold sandwich with ham and 2 different kinds of cheese. You can also make your peanut butter or nutella sandwich. The staff also bused and cleaned the table after each patron.Fitness facility. There was a pool but I didn't see anyone using it. I saw the staff maintained it daily. The gym was smallish but adequate. It had 2 treadmills, one elliptical, good selection of weights, a weight bench, towels, exercise mat, and a water fountain.Other amenities. Bath amenities were Paul Mitchell. WiFi was strong in the room, lobby and restaurant. You had 2 desktops for internet or printing boarding passes. I appreciated the lobby offerings of coffee, tea, and infused water dispenser.Cons. Some nuances: it is a bit dated but still well maintained. The WiFi seemed to drop off while I was at the Gym. I did not see an exercise ball. I can see where some folks may have issues with the noise being close to the freeway and downtown. I didn't have this issue but perhaps one can ask for earplugs. I was in Astoria, Oregon where the seals nearby bothered some guests and the hotel offered earplugs.I think this Springhill Suite by Marriott is definitely the best value one can score in downtown Seattle. I would highly recommend and definitely will return given a chance.Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your visit! We're thrilled you enjoyed everything form the large suites to all of our many amenities. You can always count on us for friendly and attentive service -- our mission is to do whatever we can to ensure you have a comfortable stay. We appreciate you recommending us, and we hope to welcome you back the next time you're in Seattle.Take care, Frank F., General Manager",Good

"There are VERY noisy rooms on the front facing Lombard, and there are MUCH quieter rooms at the rear on a no through road with zero traffic. If noise bothers you, specify a quiet room at the rear and in from the side road (Franklin).There are MUCH larger , updated rooms, and some very cramped scruffy rooms. (We are talking can't swing a cat.) Specify a larger updated room when booking, it costs the same.The breakfast in the tiny lobby has instant coffee and a few muffins and pastries, keeps the wolf from the door. Real coffee is provided for your coffee maker in the room, pick up your own half and half and have it in the fridge if you don't like instant creamer. Close enough for a healthy walk to the great local touristy places. Near public transport. The fridge and microwave allow for your own choice of snacks and simple meals. We stayed a week. We were put in the horrid, cramped, noisy room first night and made a fuss til we were moved to a MUCH better, way quieter room. No excuse for this since we had booked it months in advance, and because of the reviews had ASKED in writing for a quiet room, off the road.Free parking. This place is excellent value, if you don't let them fill up their scruffy, tiny, noisy, old rooms with you.",Good

"In March 2013, I spent a long weekend at Estancia and really, really, really enjoyed it. The food, in particular, was delicious at every meal. Everything appeared and tasted fresh, whole, and real. The spa was lovely and all employees were true professionals and excellent at their craft. Also, notable was the valet staff who always took good care of us coming and going. We also enjoyed the hot tub, especially on cool March evenings. I used a Romance Rendezvous Package that, upon checkout, I was please to discover was truly an excellent value -- the bill could have been much higher, but it wasn't. I highly recommend Estancia to anyone looking for a lovely, romantic getaway at a fair value.Thank you for writing a review about your stay last March. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed the Romance Rendezvous Package and that you had such a pleasant experience at our wonderful Spa. Thank you for recommending our hotel and spa to others and we hope to welcome you back very soon.",Good
"This hotel was everything we wanted it to be, and the price reflected that. We paid 448 per night for our room, which I have never done before-HOWEVER this was my sister's birthday treat and we wanted to do it right. Plus it included breakfast for 4, so you can take about 60 bucks off right there. I felt welcomed and like the staff truly enjoyed having us there. What a nice place, even for one night. Not sure if they can do anything about this, but there are a lot of vagrants/homeless that camp out right on the grass in front of the pool. Just was a little awkward, but it might not be the hotel's property.We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, happy birthday to your sister! We hope to welcome you back again soon.",Good
"We were there for a long weekend to celebrate my birthday. I would say that the best part of the hotel is the staff. They pamper you from beginning to end. The staff in the restaurant is wonderful. They really take care of you and make you feel welcome. They greet you by name each time they see you. We had breakfast twice and ate ate lunch once. The quality of the food is great too. The room was very nice. We were upgraded to a bigger room with a view towards the park. The location of the hotel is great: close to 5th avenue shopping, Central Park and not far from the theater district. The only part that I think needs to be remodeled is the entrance/lobby area. It's a little cramped and dark for a hotel of this quality. They were remodeling the outside though.",Good

"You cannot beat this hotel for location. On Commonwealth Ave, near a green, the oldest garden in the country, and two blocks from the green line on Boston's metro. A beautiful brownstone with loads of history. We were in the Connecticut which is a very large and beautifully appointed room. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Our water pressure was just passable, although our friends who were in another big room called Boston University had good pressure, so it seems to vary. We had a lovely view of the green while they had a view of the back of buildings. I'm sure each room has its pros and cons. The only shocker was that they didn't supply bar soap and shampoo. It didn't even occur to me that such a nice hotel would not supply basics like that. The four of us had to take time to find a CVS Pharmacy and stock up.The bed in our room was strange. I have never heard such a noisy bed when getting in and out of it. Creaking and moaning when I first sat down I thought I had a sleepless night ahead of me. However, once in bed, the mattress noises were minimal when moving around, it was just the getting in and out that was deafening.Other than that, I enjoyed my stay there and would consider them again the next time I'm in Boston.",Good

"The Hilton Garden Inn is conveniently located about 2 miles from the Orlando Airport. I decided to use this hotel since I had to spend the week working at a facility right next to the airport. Check in was quick and easy and since I was a Hilton Honors member, I was offered to have points added to my account in lieu of breakfast. This was the first time, a Hilton employee has ever asked me this question during check in (thumbs up!). Room was nice and clean and also very quiet (the two things I value the most). This Garden Inn is also located within walking distance to a pharmacy and lots of restaurants, which is a plus for any out of town guests that do not have a vehicle. The only somewhat negative experience was when I asked about larger room availability, as I plan to come back to Orlando in a month with the family. The employee did not sound very interested in trying to assist me with room information and rates, so I guess, I will find another hotel in the area for that trip. In all, while I plan to use another hotel during my next trip to Orlando, I would still recommend this Hilton Garden inn to any business travelers in the area.Dear guest Dansladen:Your effort and time in sharing your comments surrounding your experiences during your last stay is most appreciated and something we take very seriously.

"It was my cousin and I's first trip to San Francisco and we chose this hotel for its location and were not disappointed. In the morning, when we opened the windows/doors to our balcony, we could not only see the bay, breath in the fresh air of the sea, but even hear the sea lions. A walking distance from Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 and all the restaurants, it made it easy at the end of the day to just enjoy a relaxing evening, and do a little shopping. And it was just a short walk to Alcatraz's landing site and the cable car's main station. Even the famous Lombard street was a walking distance, and we could also see the Coit Tower from our balcony. And with lots of retro street cars and buses nearby, it made it easy to go visit further attractions in the city. The hotel is also very cleverly decorated like a ship, with porthole windows and bathroom mirrors, which made us feel like we were on a cruise. And the lobby recycled old containers to make up the walls, to add to the whole experience. We also enjoyed the convenience of the food truck in the yard, for snacks and drinks, but especially enjoyed sitting on the couches by the fire pits to end our days. Although a little pricy, all in all, we were happy with our choice, which made our first visit to San Francisco even better.Hi isabelledV4289FJ,First visits to San Francisco are always memorable, we are so glad we could be such a positive part of your memory. We hope we are always your go to hotel from now on. Keep your eye out for our monthly newsletter and special offers for our previous guests.Safe Travels, Jason",Good

You have coupon to go eat your breakfeast at the grill. You need to pass from the outside to go. They have toast, eggs, cereals, yogourt, ham, sausage pancake, fruits.....

"The hotel was located near union square, which is a good place to get anywhere else in the city. However, my room was located on the ground floor and my window faced a dark alley, so I didn't get any daylight. Plus it was really loud even at night which made sleeping difficult. The hotel and service were great otherwise, I guess I got a bad room and no discount on it, so for me it wasn't worth the high price.Thank you for sharing your recent stay with us. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our friendly service and central location. I am very sorry you were unhappy with your room. We do have staff available that can assist with a room move if we have something different available. We greatly appreciate your feedback and hope to impress you on a future visit.

"We have stayed at our fair share of hotels near Disneyland. Most recently we spent two nights at the Del Sol Inn. I must say from start to finish I was pleased. (And I tend to be picky). The man Jesus that checked us in was very friendly. My request to have an upstairs room was met. Our room was somewhat large. It was a big square and had two queen beds, a fold out leather sofa, and a dining table with two chairs. The square shape of the room made it feel larger. The air quality was improved when we turned on the AC. The room did smell a little humid prior to that. The beds were COMFORTABLE. The TV had a good selection of channels. The room had a microwave and fridge. They had a free breakfast with pastries, waffles, boiled eggs, and cereal. No water though only juice and coffee. Denny's is located in the same parking lot so if you want a more full service breakfast it is right there. We did not use the pool but it looked well maintained. There was a parking attendant 24/7 and they were helpful. We stored our stroller in the car to avoid taking it upstairs. I will be back. Thank you for a great last minute stay. Thank you for writing us a great review, I'm glad to know you enjoyed your stay with us. Our close proximity to the parks at a reasonable price makes us an ideal hotel to stay at. We hope to see you again next time you are in the area. Sincerely, Parveen",Good
"I recently stayed for 2 nights. This is a great location, very close to everything. The hotel is clean and safe. The staff is friendly. I do wish there were gluten free options other than fruit and yogurt for breakfast, but breakfast is free so you take what you can get.",Good
My wife and I had a great experience at the Galleria Park Hotel. We stayed for the weekend and used the valet for our car. The 5 star service and great central location was everything we could hope for and more. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.,Good

"We had a great experience here. The beds and pillows are really comfortable. It is loud outside, but we were tired at the end of the day so it didn't bother us much and we slept well. It was so fun being on the balcony. Mary the Concierge was wonderful. We enjoyed the live music and food at the bar. One downside: bathrooms are really small, and only one hook to hang towels.Dear expat5Warsaw,Thank you for being our guest at Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter. We love knowing you had an outstanding stay and that our team left a great impression. We cant wait to share your kind comments with Mary. Thanks so much for the kind review and look forward to having you as our guest again.Beth AblesGeneral Manager",Good
"I have stayed at a bunch of places in Seattle over the past 20+ years and my favorites have changed as staff, ownership, dating, maintenance, etc change. For years it was the Alexis then the Fairmont and Four Seasons then The Inn at the Market. the past few years we have stayed at the Hyatt but I thought I would try the Sorrento this weekend as I found a 249 suite deal. The rooms were huge and perfectly maintained and appointed. We loved having a book shelf filled with real books. The common areas were great and I honestly love a hotel where you can actually use the stairs anytime not just when the hotel is on fire. The staff was super friendly and helpful. This is our new favorite.Wow, parisryan, you know your Seattle hotels! I am thrilled that we are on the top of that prestigious list. Real books, real stairs, and super friendly staff, we have it all! Please come back and visit us again soon, we would be delighted to welcome you back. Cheers!Angie M. MykelGeneral Manager- Hotel Sorrento",Good
"I stayed here for 2 nights before a conference in San Diego while I explored the city on my own. Location is perfection, right in the heart of the Gaslamp district. I got a phenomenal deal on hotels.com, otherwise this would have likely been out of my price range. It was extremely clean, a decent sized room and great location, for a great sale price, what more can you ask for",Good

"We loved everything about The Pearl Hotel. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and more accommodating. Our room was VERY clean. The bar was great as was the bartender! Loved the cocktails and enjoyed their happy hour. The food was amazing! Best fish taco I had on our trip. We used their bikes to ride along the harbor into down town San Diego. Everything about The Pearl is fun. It was just what we wanted - unique, clean, great service, fun and good location.On behalf of the entire Pearl team, THANK YOU for your great review. We truly appreciate it. Thrilled to hear our staff delivered an excellent guest experience. Hospitality is so important to us. Thanks again for your support. Visit us again soon.

"Can not say enough nice things about my stay here. Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful, I felt like they knew my wife and I by the time we checked out. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated. They have a nice market with the ability to order food from various restaurants on I-Drive. The breakfast and pool areas both exceeded my expectations from what I've come to be accustomed to on trips. The room itself was super clean and well done, much bigger than I expected and a standard room would be perfect even for a larger group than I traveled with. I am a clean freak and felt totally at home here, not a single worry.I had the vacation of a life time and already want to return here. I should preface this by saying I've never stayed at a Orlando on-site resort, but I felt like this hotel provided a relaxing resort feel without the hassle of resort costs. Would and will stay again.We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay, and appreciate the time you took to share your experience. Thank you for mentioning our wonderful staff I will be sure to share your comments with each of them. Thank you again for writing such a nice review! We hope you will visit us again soon.",Good
"My family and I planned a trip on short notice to the Orlando area and my wife was a little unsure about staying here as opposed to a more expensive resort. We were both impressed with the cleanliness, staff service, features in the immediate area and a bonus we didn't expect is a shuttle to Universal. It also picks up a few other hotels so takes 20 minutes plus, but saves on parking at the park. This place helped us to Orlando on a budget!!I rated restaurant a bit lower as they don't have one on site. Like most Comfort Inns, they do have a warm breakfast which my kids were getting sick of by the end of the week, but food was good and hot, plus the the price was right!!Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We are delighted that you enjoyed your visit and our complimentary shuttle service. Even though we do not have a restaurant on property there are many choices within walking distance of the hotel from fine dining to fast food. We hope you will visit us again on your next trip to Orlando!",Good

"We selected this hotel since we wanted to be in a convenient, but historic part of New Orleans. We were here for a convention and the location was great. Two blocks away is the Riverfront streetcar that goes to the Convention center in one direction and to the French Market in the other.The hotel itself is charming and is within a block or two of House of Blues (which we enjoyed), Bubba Gumps (didn't like as much) and Hard Rock Cafe (didn't even go). Our room was large with two queen beds and overlooked an edge of the courtyard. The beds were soft, but surprisingly comfy. We were able to walk everywhere in the French Quarter including several non-chain restaurants. And the air conditioning was, well, cool... and believe me it's needed after being outdoors! They no longer serve continental breakfasts since they now have a cooking school restaurant downstairs. We had a very nice breakfast there. Dinners looked good and reasonably priced, but we just didn't try it out due to other commitments.There's a fire station across the street and a police station a couple blocks away, so you always felt safe. Didn't hear any sirens -- in fact didn't hear much noise except for an occaisional train. All in all a great place to stay and a good value for those wanting more than an anonymous chain hotel.",Good
"The hotel was nice and in a great location. My room was inward looking so there was no view of anything and the window was very small so not much light, which wasn't a huge problem as I was out all day. The bathroom was compact but good, the bed comfortable and it was very clean which is important. There was no kettle though only a coffee maker which I was not able to make tea in. I definitely recommend you join in happy hour in the lobby to sample free wines. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff were lovely and professional as well.Dear shaggygirlr0x,Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback.

The location is perfect. It is an easy walk to any of the Downtown or Belltown attractions and only about a 15 minute walk to Capitol Hill. I attended a conference at the hotel and the staff was very courteous and helpful. My flight arrived in the morning and the hotel was able to accommodate an early check in (at the time I just asked to drop off our bags). The room was clean with a great king size bed and a large soaking bathtub. Overall outstanding service and experience.,Good

Our 6th floor room was quiet and comfortable. The balcony was large enough for 4 people to sit and talk.Not a single complaint. It rained the day we were up and we got soaked. Since we did not pack extra stuff, we needed to do laundry. Soap and the machine use were complimentary. Wi-Fi was easy to setup. Fridge in the room, and bistro available downstairs.All in all, we will be back. This is our go-to hotel when visiting our kids in downtown Orlando.",Good

"The Drury Inn and Suites in the Central Business District, New Orleans is close to everything, a few minutes walk you are in the French Quarter or at the Superdome. Surrounded by restaurants and bars it makes it convenient for short or long term stays. The staff makes you feel right at home from the minute you walk in and the evening social is a great time to meet new people while enjoying the free perks the hotel offers.",Good
"This is our second year that we have stayed some nights in this downtown location. For a tour coach that comes in with 50 people, having three elevators is a huge bonus. Located within reasonable walking distance to many businesses, tourist attractions, and about a 20 minute easy walk to the French Quarter. The new addition to this complex will certainly enhance the appeal once it opens later on this year.",Good

"Just completed a one night stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We were very happy with everything and can't complain. The staff was professional and courteous. Everyone from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was friendly and always greeted us.Jason checked us in immediately and was extremely nice, efficient, and welcoming. The house keeping staff does a great job in keeping the rooms clean. The decor was modern, the bathrooms beautiful. We were upgraded at no additional charge to a corner suite, maybe because of our Platinum status or maybe because it was a monday. The view was amazing and we loved the electronic blinds and huge room. There is a great shuttle run by Gray Line that takes you to the hotel for 17 dollars round trip, 10.25 one way. We only took the shuttle from the hotel which left at 15 minutes past the hour and 45 minutes past the hour. It was right on time and took less than 45 minutes including two stops at other hotels prior to arriving at the airport. Much cheaper than a 30-40 dollar plus tip cab ride. We have gone to the restaurant Brooklyn on this trip and our last trip also. The entertainment book provides a buy one get one free coupon for it and the food although pricey is worth it. The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others. The hotel is in a good location to attractions and shopping.Pikes market is a straight 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. It is right next door to an awesome movie theatre and the Cheese Cake factory. If you can get a great deal this is a hotel that I would go back to.",Good

I was surprised to see granite countertops and modern room for the price I was paying. My kids even commented it wasn't a cheap looking room. The free buffet breakfast was great. The staff was very friendly. There was a great restaurant next door for lunch and dinner. The lounge was very cozy. I felt very safe. They provided free parking were your car was in a locked parking lot. They gave us a remote control to go in and out of gate. We just had to remember to give back the gate remote. The hotel gave a friendly note under your door the morning of check out to remember. I will definitely stay again.,Good
"This place is older and probably could benefit from some updating, however I felt very comfortable here. I stayed a week for business but I have friends and family in Texas so I had a really nice visit as well. My parents stayed with me the first couple of nights and they enjoyed the bed while I slept on the couch which was not uncomfortable. My parents relaxed and enjoyed the room while I was at work and when I returned in the evening we would go have a nice dinner at nearby restaurants. The kitchen area was nice for making coffee in the morning and the refrigerator came in handy for breakfast items in the morning or leftovers from dinner the night before. I didn't feel well the 3rd day I was there and my parents had already left. I didn't want to go out for dinner so I headed down to check out the happy hour. They had wine and snacks and light meal options which was great! I chose some soup and crackers and went back to bed and felt better by morning. I liked the pool area but didn't get a chance to enjoy it. The gift shop had sandwiches and other drinks and snacks, my sandwich was very dry and I didn't like it that much but I'm sure a different choice would have made a difference. The parking is very old school with a big heavy gate on large springs that raise to allow you into the covered multilevel parking, which they do charge you for. Overall I liked this hotel. The room was nice, the bed and pillows were comfy, nice desk area for nightly paperwork, the toothpaste they provided came in handy since I ran out and the food and beverage was a nice treat!",Good

"We stayed at the Zephyr for a week at a really good price and were impressed. The hotel is uniquely decorated and has numerous old-school/classic games in and around it...most with somewhat of a twist. The staff were all tremendously respectful and helpful from check-in to check-out. We brought a small issue with our original room to Lauren and she happily re-accommodated us.The Zephyr is centrally located with easy walking access to a lot of SF's tourist and food spots..it was really convenient.The only negatives I'd say are that the fridge size is deceiving. It looks like a medium sized fridge from the outside but when you open it, the actual fridge is teeny tiny so there isn't much room for stuff. And, the parking was expensive.Overall though, we had a great time and enjoyed our stay at the Zephyr..and we know where to stay if we decide to visit SF again.You certainly got to live like a local, Cecilio L! We love sharing our local go to spots so our guests get the true SF experience, after all that's why we travel! Come see us on your next adventure to the city. Cheers, James",Good

"Stayed on the second floor in a king suite. The rooms/lobby feel a little bit dated, but the location and amenities make up for it!Princess greeted me when I checked in (with mobile check in) and was absolutely phenomenal. We had requested a room with 2 queen size beds, but they were booked up, so we made due with the pull out sofa.So nice being pet friendly, we had our companion animal with us and he was comfortable as were we!Nice pool/hot tub area. Parking spots were tight, but manageable. Breakfast was well stocked and very top notch. Some dust on the fake flower arrangements near the buffet, which would be my only complaint about breakfast. Tortillas to make breakfast burritos, standard eggs/meat/cereal/waffles/yogurt/bread station, etc. (no potatoes, which was surprising)The pizza restaurant was great as well. They told us about 2 hour wait, but felt like only 30/45 minutes, and they were good size pizzas, not what I was expecting!Overall, 10/10 stay. Would definitely stay here again!",Good
"After my husband deploying out overseas I needed some well deserved girl time weekend. We rented several rooms and was so plesently surprised wtih everything. We weren't sure what things to see in the area and did not want to miss anything worth seeing. The manager took extra time to explain food, entertainment and girl things to do in the area which he felt we wouldn't want to miss.

"I'm used to airport hotels being over crowded and worn down from the sheer crush of people going in and out. This goes double for ones in a tourist mecca like Orlando.But this property is far from that. We stayed for three nights over New Years, and were impressed from start to finish. Common areas were just as clean and polished as the rooms, and though we didn't use them, the pool, fitness room, and business centers all looked spiffy, clean, and well kept. The staff do an amazing job keeping things running well for guests, and it shows!We did use the restaurant after our late night arrival, and we were impressed there too. The cheeseburger was cooked just right, toppings were fresh and crisp, and the fries were outstanding. The wife had the chicken quesadilla and it too was way better than we might have assumed. Good beer and wine list as well, and we even snagged a mini bottle of prosecco to ring in the new year with later.Breakfast buffet was good also. Mostly standard fare, but all was cooked well, served hot and fresh, and coffee pot was never empty. Can't ask for too much more there.Overall, we had a great experience here. We normally don't use airport hotels, but of the ones we have used over time, this one sets a dang high bar. I'd definitely recommend it.",Good

Thank you especially to Nina for reservations, Alfred for all his recommendations for things to do in LaJolla, and to chef Fernando for imaginative and delicious breakfasts.

"Hotel is in two buildings one of which parallels the road and there is a railroad track behind both properties. However, with the windows closed you really don't hear anything. The room is more of a studio than a suite but fine for one or two. Looked at their two room suites and downside is only one bathroom but living area is spacious. Nicely sized and equipped kitchen. Breakfast area is a bit small in the morning but easy enough to take things back to the room and plenty of space there.Front desk people and breakfast room staff were very helpful and pleasant. There is a shuttle to Disney but I did not use it. The free parking is unusual for hotels in the area and appreciated.There are several restaurants and a Starbucks within easy walking distance which is handy.Dear MOBX,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate. I am glad that we were able to provide you with great customer service and that you reveled in the free parking and close restaurants.

"We have stayed here numerous times when it was a Super 8 and just stayed there again this past holiday weekend after it changed to Pinckneyville Inn.

"Went to Orlando to go on a cruise. We arrived a day early to avoid any issues making the boat. We arrived at the hotel before the room was ready but that was not a problem. We were given access to the pool and our luggage stored for us. Within 30 min I was notified of our room being ready. On our stay post-cruise it was another great experience. We had access to the pool and our room was ready, immediately. The hotel was within walking distance of at least 15 places to eat ranging from fast food to nice sit down. Please accept my appreciation for your wonderful feedback regarding both your stays at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I am so pleased that you had a wonderful experience before and after your cruise and our location was perfect for your needs as well. Our associates pride themselves in providing excellent quality in their service to guests so your comments tell me that we are on target in meeting our service goals. Thank you for your nice review. We hope that you will visit again soon. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport",Good
"I've stayed at Hyatt house Seattle during the Spring break. My family really enjoy the stay there. I would strongly recommend people with kids to stay in this hotel because of the convenient location. It is right next to the Space needle, EMP museum and the Chihuly Garden Museum. Ride the Ducks of Seattle office is right across the street from the hotel, so, we were able to also join the tour conveniently right after our visit at the playground right next to the EMP. It is a very fun playground for kids. The breakfast is good at the hotel. So, next time you go to Seattle, Hyatt house should be one of your choice.osaka2010,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way.

"my sister and I surprised my husband to a train ride to New Orleans for his bday, we picked this hotel because of the beautiful pictures and great location (close to everything). Upon making my reservations, Danielle was extremely helpful, nice and friendly. once we arrived, Danielle was just as she was over the phone (a plus to me being a GM at a hotel)The hotel was just as beautiful as the photos, and I must say, if you are not satisfied with anything, the staff goes above and beyond to correct it.

"I gave this hotel 4 stars for staff and location. The staff were pleasant, very helpful and upbeat. It's a great location right in the center of many historical sights! It's walking distance to sights like Penn's Landing, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The hotel is across from the US Mint, next to Ben Franklin's grave and near some good eateries like Sonny's and Happily Ever After. It also offers its own restaurant, bar and fitness center. Free wifi. It was a reasonable rate for the area. Parking was 36.75 for overnight but you can keep your car there the next day until 5pm. However you may be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. As far as the rooms themselves go- those I would rate a little lower. The room was a little on the small side and definitely could have been cleaner (like the bathroom and under the beds) but it was adequate and by no means did I feel like it was so dirty I wouldn't stay the night. Rooms are probably a 3 however. The room did have a coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator which was great! They are updating some different features so maybe this was part of it. Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and I would agree that we are in the perfect location to visit many of the historical sites in the area. It's a great part of town. Thank you again and we hope to see you back sometime in the near future. Regards,",Good
"We stayed at PSI for 3 nights in Premium room 33. The view from the room was spectacular even though it was partial ocean view but it was so soothing to sea the ocean and waves from your bed.Theres a table and chairs outside the room to enjoy the view while having tea/coffee. The hotel is just a minute walk to the beach and few minutes from the pier. The breakfast was just ok with muffins, croissants, tea, coffee and juices , just for takeaway as theres no place to sit and eat. The only thing that sucked was the WiFi . It really took hours to connect. Overall its a nice place to stay. Would stay again if they improve the WiFi quality and the breakfast.",Good

"Stayed here Jan. 25-28 for work. The room was very spacious and well appointed. The separate living area with sink, microwave and refrigerator is great. I have family in Seattle who came to visit me and the four of us were able to spread out and relax. The bathroom arrangement is good with the sink and vanity separate. There was some freeway noise, but for me it was more like white noise didn't bother my sleep at all. I did not have to use my ear plugs. The bed and linens were very comfortable and although the hand towels and face cloths were a little thin the bath towels were nice. The breakfast is ample and the all day coffee/tea bar is a lifesaver! The business center is also well appointed and the in-room wi-fi was reliable. The location worked great for me. I needed to be at the Convention Center and it was a 10 minute walk. Finally, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I forgot contact lens solution and the front desk did their best to find an 24 hr drugstore and ended up directing me to a nearby convenience store which was short walk from the hotel.

"I want to thank all of the staff at the Estancia for the wonderful service for our meeting we had in April. Even with the additional guest due to the fires they were accommodating and very friendly. My daughter and I, along with a friend and her daughter stayed and additional two days to have a little vacation before her wedding in June, We had a massage planned and just relaxing by the pool. My daughter spotted a bathing suit cover up, purchased it and wore it during her bachelor party in Cabo two week later. She lost it and loved it. I called Estancis spa t and spoke to Heather ( who had helped us previously with our massage and the purchase of the coverup), she remembered exactly who we were and which one. They did not have anymore but was able to get the designer name, look it up on line and find the exact one! She gave me all this information so I could purchase another one and surprise my daughter. This is going above and beyond! We will be coming back again and certainly will go to the spa again! Thank you Heather!! Thank you Deb and Sarah!Thank you for taking the time to share your wonderful experience on Trip Advisor.

Add that to the price of this hotel and you're still not even close to the price of a fancy hotel. We stay here for medical reasons at UT Southwestern St Paul, so if you're looking for that reason, it's very close, just a 3 min drive up Harry Hines, no interstate driving required!

"You can't beat the location of this hotel. It is on a quiet street, but within walking distance to all kinds of dining, drinking and shopping. The adorable courtyard with a pool is reason enough to stay. I could have spent all afternoon enjoying it. They had a continental breakfast which we did not take advantage of, but it looked like a pretty average continental breakfast spread. In the afternoon they put out cookies and lemonade in the eating area, I thought that was a really nice touch. We had one of the interior rooms, which I enjoyed, especially after a long night out in the Quarter, it allowed me to sleep much later than I would have if the sun had been shining in. I thought it was a very nicely appointed room, and very clean. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but everyone seemed friendly enough.

And also, honestly, the scrumptious food coming from the kitchen. The chef is awesome! I had been told to stay at The Pearl by a colleague who said that the rooms are just OK but the bar scene and dinners are non-pareil. He was right!Thank you very much for the kind review.

"Ok, for those that are wondering in Seattle where to stay, I successfully picked out the two hotels that are close to all attractions, reasonably priced and had a jacuzzi for helping with the soreness of the feet from walking around to all the attractions! Grand Hyatt and the Sheraton. I had stayed at the Sheraton, which had a nice jacuzzi on top, but wanted to try the Grand Hyatt. We pulled in, had a room readily available, and went to our room. The bathrooms are huge and my wifed loved this. No complaints about the room. The hotel had a nice gym where I was able to workout in the morning with a few of the LA Angels prior to playing the Mariners. Very nice gym with a connecting jacuzzi area. They also had a sauna and a very large and hot! steam room. Connected to the hotel is a really nice Sushi restauant, which if you like sushi, you should check this out as the dishes roll around the restaurant on little conveyer belts. They also had a NY deli style place to grab sandwhiches and a Starbucks. I would stay here. They guys running the valet are very professional as you could tell they know their stuff. The front desk check in was very pleasant. But, one word of caution...nothing to fault of the hotel but more the city of Seattle. My wife and I fell asleep Sunday night around 8pm, thinking we were going to wake up and head out to a restaurant. At 12:15 am, I was out of luck to getting any type of food. Room service closed, so the only thing I could purchase was small little crackers and cookies from the front desk. Not a big deal, but you would think in a city that size you could walk to some place and get a sandwhich. In the morning, I didnt see breakfast, so I think it was all room service. BUT, dont eat there, walk 6 blocks to the Pikes Market and go to Le Panier or Poscky's for pastries. Wonderful Go there early and beat the lines! Eat breakfast at Lowells for crab-dishes.",Good

Newly renovated, Very clean, nice decor, working and clean mini fridge, microwave, and TV with cable. The staff was very friendly and professional. We will stay there again if in that area while traveling.",Good
"Not much has changed.. we have stayed here several times. Same friendly staff that makes me feel at home. Recently redecorated rooms seemed unnecessary, but tastefully done. A nice touch! Staff has extensive knowledge of Island happenings, nothing has ever been too much trouble.",Good
"We were taking the train home to Los Angeles, and this is the closest hotel to the Amtrak Train Station. The staff is very good, and the valet took very good care of us, the room was very clean and comfortable.",Good
"This is located in the French Quarter, with a view of the Mississippi River, and is within walking distance of all the quarter has to offer. The rooms are nestled into several restored buildings and no two are alike. They are comfortable, clean, have new bathrooms. The courtyard is a great place to sit outside and has a small pool. The staff is knowledable and friendly.We're thrilled that you had a great stay at the French Market Inn. Thank you for sharing your feedback about our historic hotel's location and service. We look forward to welcoming you back soon.",Good
"If you're looking for a quiet and peaceful stay in a historic neighborhood, this hotel would be wonderful choice. Traveling from the hotel to the French Quarter takes approximately 20-30 minutes (depending on your means of transportation). You can pick up the streetcar near the hotel (though some of the lines are currently undergoing construction and buses are used as replacements). The hotel has free onsite parking (though the parking spaces immediately adjacent to the hotel are somewhat limited) and free breakfast. The rooms are average sized, with two sinks an added bonus. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and efficient. I would definitely stay here again.",Good

Good location, nice view, room was kept well stocked, snacks and drinks in the room were very nice.MoreDear seyicdhamede, I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and the many amenities that we have to offer. Thank you for your comments on service and atmosphere. We look forward to welcoming you back again in the near future. Sincerely, Jamie Fox...More",Good
"Overall, it was a great experience. I would caution you that if you book through a third party that you confirm your requests directly with the hotel before arrival. Front desk staff very helpful. Breakfast staff more interested in chatting with each other while guests waited.",Good
"If you are the type of family/group that likes a fine hotel with plush rooms and over the top customer service, this is not the hotel for you. This hotel has some thin walls, and really small parking spaces.However, this hotel is located directly across the street from the Disneyland's main entrance. It makes for easy access in the morning and at night when the last thing you want to do is take a tram back to the hotel or parking lot. Its location also makes the afternoon nap a definite possibility.Besides the location, it has a nice pool, comfortable beds, and it is plenty clean. The best part of this hotel is the AC that will cool down your room in under a minute, plus it gives you that AC sound that reminds you of how sweet vacation really is.",Good
"This hotel is good, the rooms are clean and overall it's satisfactory. Some of members of the staff are really helpful, others not so much, I've been here several times and this last stay didn't have the best service, nothing wrong with it, just didn't go the extra mile! But the very best is the location, it's close to everything and that gives you many choices for restaurants and shopping.",Good

We would love for you to come back and see us again in the future!Yours in hospitality, Paulette M.",Good
"Due to its proximity near Key Arena (where I was seeing a concert), Id figure it would be best to stay at a nearby Starwood property. This particular location was about a 10 minute walk (1km) to the venue, with restaurants along the way, and its also near the Seattle Space Needle for those who want to do some sightseeing. Note that this property use to be under the management of Comfort Suites.I redeemed my Starpoints for this stay this was an SPG category 3 hotel, with redemption starting at 7,000 starpoints. Parking was 15/night and is underground and gated.A walk into the lobby and you can tell that it was recently renovated, with a huge lobby, dining, and bar area. There was a dedicated SPG check-in counter along with dedicated SPG rooms. This property was also recently upgraded to RFID sensor locks instead of the traditional old style swipe card door lock. This was a nice feature due to the recent security concerns with the swipe card locks.Upon check-in I was told that I received a complimentary upgrade to their Deluxe Room (from Traditional), which features larger rooms and a sofa/couch. The hotel window faces the Space Needle and the Bill Gates Foundation. I was also offered the choice of a complimentary drink or extra points. No point asking for complimentary wi-fi since their wi-fi cost is already included in the room price.For those who dont know, Four Points is considered one of the budget brandings for Starwood. I came here with no high expectations at all. However, to my surprise, I would consider this a pretty good property with clean rooms and comfortable bedding. In fact, I would have given the staff members my remaining 4 x 500 starpoints codes.if I hadnt forgot about them at home. Highly recommended.Thank you very much for the review. We are pleased to hear we exceeded your expectations and you enjoyed the comfort of your room. Are staff are among our best assets and we are thrilled to hear they made your stay pleasant. Thanks again for your kind words.",Good

"We stayed at this hotel in early July 2014 and it was an instant favorite of ours. Its in a great location and has incredible charm and character. We stayed in a petite room that had a window overlooking the courtyard. Our room was one of the recently renovated ones so it was very, very nice. The staff we encountered were all very nice and helpful. We felt like royalty. Pros: People, Product and Price. You can't go wrong here as long as you get one of the renovated rooms. Its also very close to some tasty restuarants, shopping, the acquarium, etc.Cons: Your overall experience will probably depend on which room you get. Also, its New Orleans and so the parkin situation is not great. I think they hotel charges 35/night and they warned us that it would take upwards of an hour to get our car from the valet due to the event status of our stay.",Good
We travel from Albany to this area in order to visit relatives in Plattsburgh and then go to the casino. We absoultely LOVE this place....we are always treated kindly.

"The hotel is quite close to the airport and offers free shuttle which is very convenient. In spite of proximity noise is rarely a bother. Bedrooms have a decent size and so do the bathrooms and housekeeping do their job quite thoroughly. Toiletries are nice, no showercap so bring yours if so needed. Towels very good quality. Mattress comfortable and so are pillows. Complementary good quality coffee and tea (would love some cookies).Staff is super friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.The place is quite far from city at some 35USD in regular taxi and about half with Uber. There's a nice outlet close by and the blue line is relatively close. However, this is not a convenient place if you are visiting Chicago as will take you a while to get there, is great though for conventions and similar events. Has parking places but you may want to check price beforehand.Wifi great and tech support simply too good to be true. The restaurant has great options and both wine and cocktails selections very good but perhaps a bit pricey.If they also had shuttles for the city would be paradise. In any case highly recommendable for the kind of situations described above.",Good
"Mandarin Oriental HotelMiami Fl A CHIC PARADISE HOTEL...BETTER THAN EVER ! This are the kind of notes and review that I'm joyfully writing...A review about a great hotel...A hotel that holds a soft spot in our impenitent travelers hearts...A place that we missed a lot as we haven't been in Miami in sometime...Finally we had motive to drive down from our North Orlando home to Miami Jose Carlos, one of our dearest godsons that live and works there, was getting marry last August. As soon as we had that great news I planned-as I usually do- a mini Gastrotour not only in Mia, but in Palm Beach as well. Later on our planned road-tour and Gastrotour suffered alterations Rafa, husband of Angui our oldest daughter, needed a hip surgery and it was scheduled on those days. When we go to Miami we always stay in a place that we love:The Mandarin Oriental Hotel ! We made our reservations for the wedding-way ahead of time- using as a first time the TripAdvisor hotel reservations system linked to Booking.com. I'm obliged to mention that we got, via TA, excellent rates at the Mandarin, were we planned to stay just for 3 days, bur plans changed and we needed to stay one day at Miami's Doral area, were Rafa had its hip surgery. With those changes we needed to check in at the Mandarin one day before our TA scheduled reservation and this is just part of this review framed on the moments lived on those days. As we, my wife and myself, were driving into that nice Brickell's Ave areas, passed Brickell and had that magnificent views at Mandarin behind the bridge that connects mainland to Brickell Key...we felt-literally- like arriving in Paradise. That's are our wholeheartedly tender feelings towards the area and a hotel place that holds a soft spot in our hearts ! At Lobby and reception areas we felt like home and no-different was treatment at our arrival...needing to check-in a day previous to our reservation. After we explained the reception staff-courteous, proper and friendly as ever- that we are olde regular costumers in need to check in that day, they were helpfully at getting us one of their very best Rooms, within quality reserved, Room 1815 located on 18 th floor with the most splendid views to Biscayne Bay and those beautiful Southwestern water Seas, great by day, but even greater by Miami multicolored lights night That views are just part, as well, of the myriad of details that makes The Mandarin...a paradise found ! Before going on some details of our fantastic renovated experience there, I'm obliged to note that being a Hotel Developer and Owner, being professional Architect specialized in Resorts and Hotels designs and being a high end traveler all my life with a very clear understanding on hotel management and meanings of their offerings and designs...In can, professionally and humanly, asserts that the Mandarin Oriental, in Brickell Key, has what a great hotel needs certain style in its attractive design elegance and distinction, warmth and intimacy in the architecture and its deco design and architectural layout, which is not boxed into standards, offering a different theme in hospitality, from entranced areas to guest-rooms to facilities...making every single stay in it a unique experience ! Those are qualities, together with personalized Services and Building maintenance, of paramount importance to defined a property as a Grand Hotel, but lets have a look at some of it: Location in that Chic Miami areas is great just steps from Brickell Ave and a renovated Downtown areas, and others prime Miami areas with easy driving distances to archifamous Miami Beaches and those in historic Coral Gables Exterior image. With its masterwork architectural design...Its an attraction, as a building, itself majestically sited on the best corner of Brickell Key Reception is simply a work of art. Rather chic and perfectly designed with its very high ceiling, bottom to ceiling panoramic glasses, furniture and deco details (including a mural size artwork of Urea Rib a famous dominican painter), elegant front desk with proper done human-scale details with includes an always nice welcoming cold tea beverage... ....while you are at AW, with the most splendid paradisiac views ! Guests Facilities. Those areas are perfect and offering everything needed and more to be qualified as a luxurious Five Star Hotel: The Mandarin hosts two of Southwest best fine restaurants: AZUL and La Mar by Gaston Acurio a prestigious latin chef, native of Peru, is a fantastic new addition at Mandarin with his superb Peruvian and LatinAmerican recipes (reviewed independently). At Azul we were happily and friendly greeted by one of their Servers that knos us very well, from our previous visits...since Michell Berstein was in charge of their kitchen...which is still doing a great work ! Besides that they added a perfect and needed area to bring up more live to their large Lobby in the manner of MO- Bar Lounge. Nice and chic with great views, better drinks and light snacks, but pleasing to all discerning foodies and either a perfect meeting place or to have sunset drinks and Champagnes...or after dinner digestifs. All restaurants has a clever architectural design, as self standing ones, allowing independence between Hotel Guests and gastro-restaurant goers. The Mandarin SPA offers an ultimate luxury Spa experience from a variety of therapeutic treatments that we enjoyed several times over the years. We considered it as one the greatest Spa in US due to their highly trained therapist that can work the needs of each individual Guests Facilities. Among others they had niceTerraces right next to the crystal waters, swimming pools and exterior leisure areas just for guests Meeting areas and Events. They are well located meeting and event areas as we can noticed with independent access and services...as good as they can be. We never had used, but as hotelier I did notice their users pleased and comfortably going up and down by the elevators Their Concierge service, as always, was fantastic and helpful. We love to find that they keep staff with such a great work attitude Staff. In hotels, as in any other large Business in Service to costumers, service is of paramount importance, but that comes from a vertical command in which every and each part of that chain knows its duties Service to Costumers before all with faithful and neat behavior in and out and above their service hours...as they are trained here in all departments, at Mandarin. Last, but not the least important: Rooms at Mandarin are one of its strongholds they are FANTASTIC. We loved our great latest room on floor 18th with it great views and all its multiple details distribution, siting areas, great bedding and comfort, great deco, furniture and ambiance. Besides they- Mandarin Hotel- were one of the firsts fine hotels introducing the semi-opened bathrooms...making it, for architect and art lovers souls- like mine- a very special feeling of innovation, freshness and well-being. This time- fir different reasons- we did not reserved (as usual) their Executive high floor Rooms...our favorites there (besides their great Suites), but their management and staff attentions were above and beyond any expectations ... ....on that- our 25th stay- there: At our arrival we received a beautiful basket arrangement with Fruits, Cheeses and Champagne, but better than that was the nice note from Mrs Bustamante, welcoming us -back again- to our beloved Mandarin !Every and each one of those myriad of details at Mandarin Oriental Hotel could be overlooked by others, but not by us......as discerning high end travelers and Hotel Owners ! ...and that's why we keep this hotel in a very soft spot in our hearts ...and that's why my dear wife asked me Antonio lets stay one more day...with no-words needed thats why we stayed there a couple of more fantastic days ! hoping to be back as soon as we can !",Good
"Got to the hotel late at night, hard to see much outside to distinguish this property from others. Went bed quickly without looking around. So, limited impressions at first.The next morning, coffee in hand, I began to take more notice. The room had been renovated recently (new carpet, paint, trim, counter, furniture, TV service appliances, bath updated) Very comfortable. As I went outside, I noticed more about the grounds. New paint on the buildings, landscaping was very tidy. Everything was orderly and clean without being overdone (ala Disneyland).This property gives the impression of an ownership that takes pride in their establishment both in the physical presentation and in the service of the staff. They have worked hard to make thoughtful choices and quality improvements. Great value for the price.",Good

"Stay for 2 nights on October with my wife. The hotel decoration is very classy, from the lobby up to our room. Check-in and check-out is very smooth. Location wise, even it is close to some major attractions (Union square, etc) but also close to Tenderloin which make us feels a bit insecure (not their fault btw). Only problem is on our last day just before check-out when we waited for the lift for nearly 10 mins. We've got to drag our heavy luggage and found out that the lift is out of service. At least put some sign on each floor that the lift is broken. Otherwise everything else should be ok.Dear Andai,We are so fortunate to have you and your wife as our guests this year in our hotel. We thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. More importantly, we are glad our staff was able to have a smooth check-in and check-out for you. We do apologized for the lift breaking down on your last day with us, we do thank you for your feedback and we will definitely take the appropriate measurements on notifying people when it breaks down next time.

"Stayed at this Hotel with my wife and 14yr old son for four nights last week and it was faultless. You could easily drive past it when travelling down 6th Street but what a find. Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful as were the young staff at the entrance. The room we had was a 'suite' was perfect. Nice large living room area with a separate bedroom and large bathroom which included a Jacuzzi type large bath and separate shower. My only criticism is that the mattress on the large sofa bed which my son used was a bit rock solid!! Fridge in the living room was very handy with a large TV and another TV in the bedroom. As for the facilities in the hotel the outdoor pool and terrace area was excellent. Spotlessly clean there were plenty of sun loungers, cabana type rest areas (complimentary) as well as other soft seated areas with the bonus of a few 'fire-pits' which came on later in the evening to sit by. There was also a 'get together' hour daily between 5pm 6pm, either in the Hotel lobby or the adjoining 'J Six' bar. This comprised of free wine/beer and snacks and was very enjoyable. Also you had free coffee/tea every morning available in the Lobby area. The Hotel location is also excellent. One block away from the busy 'Gaslamp quarter' with many eating/drinking options, a ten minute walk to the Harbour area and only a couple of minutes walk from 'Petco Park' where the San Diego Padres baseball team play. All in all I cannot fault this hotel....staff were so helpful and friendly, room excellent and the pool bar area a delight to use. San Diego impressed me a lot and if I visit again I will be booking this Hotel without a doubt!!What a lovely review, thank you dingomell! I could not be happier to read all about your visit to the hotel, it sounds like you had a wonderful visit. I appreciate the feedback regarding the pull-out sofa beds, we will certainly take a look at those to see if we can do something about that, thank you for sharing your sons experience with that sofabed. I was particularly pleased to see that you enjoyed the little extra amenities we offer like the social hour and amenities at the pool deck. I love that there is no hesitation to come back and see us again. See you soon! Cheers! Shannon",Good

We're delighted you enjoyed your stay with us and it sounds like you were a fan of our hotel's location right in the heart of Waikiki. When you're booking your next Hawaiian getaway, we hope you'll choose to stay with us again!Mahalo",Good
"I was very impressed with the Sorrento Hotel. The bed was covered in high quality pillows of varying firmness, the sheets were also high quality, and the comforter was similar to the Heavenly bed at Westin. Free high speed internet access was definitely a major plus, as were the free NY Times and Wall Street Journal in the lobby.Although their valet parking was expensive, there is plenty of metered on street parking in the area (meters not read from 6 pm to 8 am).My only complaint was that the room was somewhat small for a hotel of this quality. Although the square footage was probably about average, a lot of in was wasted on the long hallway in the room. The actual living area was somewhat cramped, especially when the pillows were removed from the bed. Still, I thought the hotel was an excellent value for the money, and I would definitely stay there again.",Good
"We stayed here for the start of Mardi Gras and the location was just perfect. Efficient check-in by staff but had to wait for room as it was not ready. This was no problem for us at all. We had just missed breakfast but tea and coffee was on tap all day at no extra cost which was a nice touch. When our room was ready (we were in the main block) we were pleasantly surprised how roomy it was with king sized bed, fridge, iron and ironing board and good bathroom with bath tub. It overlooked the lovely courtyard and pool area. The hotel didn't do lunch or dinner but staff were very helpful in suggesting a deli for lunch, where you could bring your sandwich back and eat in the breakfast area, and were helpful in suggesting where to eat for dinner. Bourbon Street was only a few blocks away which was very convenient. All in all, very attentive staff, good accommodation, excellent location, lovely courtyard with pool (although it was too cold to use it when we were there). Free wfi with small buriness centre. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.Thank you for choosing The Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay in New Orleans.

"Stayed here for one night on business. Check in was quick and easy. At first glance, the atrium was impressive. plenty of room to relax, do work, grab a drink or just relax. My room was on the 10th floor and was spacious and had nice views of north atlanta. i met my coworker in the hotel bar/lounge for some appetizers and cocktails. we were so full from the appetizers! The pizza was soooo good and drinks were made to perfection. Later in the evening, i decided to check out the workout facilities. I spent about an hour or so on treadmill. The workout facilities were great, air conditioned and spacious with seperate cardio and free weights room which also led out to a nice indoor pool/whirlpool. Really convenient that the fitness center ins 24 hrs. Then i discovered another perk of the hotel....the womens locker room - seriously looked like a spa and smelled like one..it was so relaxing after a nice workout.

"Spent two nights with my adult daughter and could not be more pleased. The room appeared to be recently renovated and finishes were good. Lovely full size tiled shower (no bath). Our room was on the U-shaped surround of the courtyard, which was lovely and full of greenery, a fountain, pool and several shaded tables.The breakfast was disappointing with low-end standard fare. But the service in all areas of the hotel was excellent. It's at the upper edge of the French Quarter and everything was easily walkable. The added bonus was the opportunity to see more of the lovely architecture. This is a great place to visit with a group of friends/family. The courtyard affords the opportunity to gather and socialize without everyone piling in a room or hanging in the lobby (both awkward options!). It's a very intimate feeling hotel.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff.. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us. Sincerely, Chastity",Good
"We stayed at the Orchard Garden Hotel for three nights during our California vacation and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is located just outside the gates to Chinatown and we were able to walk to the Embarcadero, Pier 39, Coit tower, Golden Gate state park, etc. The rooms are a little smaller than other hotel rooms we've stayed in however the bathroom was quite spacious. I am very particular about cleanliness and this hotel was clean, new, and well run. Comfortable beds and pillows, free movie rentals! The only thing missing would be a nice hot tub on the roof!

"Very recently we were looking for a hotel near the Orlando Convention Center without having to pay an arm an a leg. We found the Comfort Inn Suites Universal at a very reasonable price and looked for reviews. As always, there were some good ones and some bad ones. We took the chance and we got the surprise of our life.As soon as we arrive, we knew we had made the right choice.Checking-in was like a breeze. We have heard that the higher floors were quieter and had a better view and even though we have already a room assigned, the reception person (Neil), gave us a room even closer to the corner.The room was not only attractive, but huge and very clean. 2 very were comfortable queen beds plus an area with a sofa-bed and a table.The location is great for the price. 1.5 km (1 mile) from the Convention Center, one block from International Drive, close to all kind of restaurants and stores.Breakfast (between 6.30 and 10 am) could be a little better. It's not bad, but every morning they have the same items.By far the highlight of this hotel is the staff. They'll go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your stay. Kudos to Neil, Fuse and Orlando in the reception desk (if you need information, talk to them) and to the cleaning ladies which were always smiling and doing an excellent job. One morning we even saw the Manager (Alberto) cleaning the floor at the entrance of the elevators after a careless guest coming from breakfast, spilled some liquid and didn't do anything about it.The only down side is that the hotel receives large groups or tourists, and if one of these groups is having breakfast, you may be for a long wait.Like most Comfort Inn in the world, the service is superb. If you forgot any toiletry, all you have to do is ask for it.By far, one of the best hotel in the area for the price.We are going back to Orlando very soon, and we'll go back to the Comfort Inn Suites Universal ...... for more friendly and excellent service.CONGRATULATIONS!Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review about your stay with us. It is so nice of you to recognize our wonderful staff. I will share your comments with all of them. We are looking forward to having you as our guest again in the near future.",Good
"So close to everything! My only small comment would be to have the pool/beach towels more accessible. I had to bring my daughter in the stroller down to the basement, and only the one elevator went down that far. Minor detail to a great week.Aloha T4978ZSamandap, Thank you for your wonderful review! We are very glad to hear that you had such an amazing experience with us and we hope to have you back again soon! Sincerely, Guest Relations Waikiki Resort Hotel",Good
"We had a great experience at River Hotel. Due to airline issues, we arrived at 1:00 am, and they held our room for us and even gave us a river view at our request upon arrival. They gave us restaurant recommendations and helped out with getting around. We never felt like our questions were bothering them or they were too busy for us. They even helped us print our return flight tickets before leaving.We did not feel that the room was small at all, like we saw some others say. It was the same size as other hotel rooms we've been in. We loved the charm of the building, rather than being in a newly built hotel. We liked the accommodations in general. My only negative was our water pressure in the shower. It was practically nonexistent...I felt like Kramer on Seinfeld...took forever to do my hair afterwards.The location is AMAZING. Right in the middle of things and along the river. The L-train stop is nearby with several lines that meet there. It is right across from Trump Tower (take that as you may, I suppose). Like others have said, you can walk to so much. Overall, amazing experience. We will go back.",Good
We spent the week of March 11 at the hotel and had a very nice stay. We had 2 suites (one bedroom suite for my husband and I and a two bedroom suite for son and his wife and 4 children). The 2 bedroom suite was a generous size for the family of six. The one bedroom suite was very nice with a door separating the bedroom from the living/kitchen space. The rooms were neat and clean. We never experienced any problems with housekeeping. The kitchen was fully stocked and had a full size fridge. Plently of room for snacks and drinks. The weather was a little chilly while we were there so the pool was only used one afternoon. But it was well maintained. The staff was very pleasant. The breakfast was fine. We did not partake in the evening menu so we cannot comment. But it was nice to have that option. The location was close to the Disney Parks and other attractions. We would return to this hotel again.,Good
"Like I said, Service Service, Service, the old fashion way. We booked this on line and went off the reviews from Tripadvisor. The hotel is more incrediable in person. We happen to love the decor. The staff was over the top friendly and helpful. Someone said it was a noisy intersection, we didn't notice, our window faced the front of the hotel. The room was awesome, with a separate lounge area and bedroom. I felt like a queen in bed with all the down pillows, I was watching the Royals and waiting for the new prince to be born. I wish we could have stayed longer. We will be back if opportunity allows it. Thank you for your kind words! I agree, a perfect place to watch the Royal wedding! Hope you came down for afternoon tea. :)Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel",Good
"Very close to everything I wanted to see. CenturyLink Field, safeCo, and public market. There is a ton of food options with a sushi bar starbucks, Ruth Chris and a Cheesecake Factory in the same building. If you need it there is also a hertz car rental in the same building. One thing I would want is a balcony. Bathroom has a shower and a tub.",Good
The hotel is nice and clean and the staff is very nice and helpful. The room was nice and we couldn't hear anything from the room next door it was awesome. Continental breakfast was exactly what it says.,Good
The Hilton Garden Inn is always consistently good. We stopped here for a night on our way to the Federation of Nevis and St. Kitts. We had an early flight in the morning and this was the perfect place to stay. It's close to the airport and there were lots of very good restaurants close by. We look forward to returning to Miami and the Hilton Garden Inn again.,Good
"Very good hotel. Staff are excellent. Location is in the heart of the french quarter. Enjoyed the afternoon sitting on my balcony and watching life unfold on Burbon Street. Everything is within walking distance, so park your car and enjoy the nightlife New Orleans offers and then it is only a short stroll to the hotel.",Good
A great location for a large group. Villa sleeps 10. On site activities provided yet our mission was Disney. Only 10 minutes. Nowadays when you stay on the property you are just as far. Easy walk to Marriott world and the largest pool in Florida. Although site provides pool and hit tub. Shuttles provided to work world center.We found pizza and Chinese's who deliver or many places nearby. Even use the concierge to get you all set. Only setback was an anticipated Full pullout in one room only to have a twin. As we had 5 little ones it didn't put us out but ask if thinking on all days.,Good

"Staff was more than helpful, REALLY clean and comfy rooms, kitchenettes are great, breakfast was really good!! But don't count on the transportation to Disneyland. They sell out FAST. Don't stress, use LIFT!! Costs less, It's quicker and the drivers are all nice. Back to the hotel... we lost a dog while there, still looking for him. The ENTIRE staff took part in trying to find him, either physical search or social media blast. And they consoled my mentality challenged sister. WONDERFUL PEOPLE!! 10 STARS!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AND WE WILL RETURN!!Thanks for your excellent review of our property! We hope that your furry family member makes it back safe and sound. Thanks for choosing the TownePlace Suites in Anaheim!",Good
"Back Bay is an excellent place to stay in Boston, and this hotel is lovely. Don't expect mod cons, although you have everything you need. The rooms are decked out with lovely antique furniture, enormous marble bathrooms and delicious cookies and a continental breakfast included (also they have a coffee machine that makes reasonable strong coffee that's good to get you going in the morning). I stayed in a single room that shared a bathroom with one other room. The room was small, with a single bed, but the bed was comfortable and big enough for one. I peeked into one of the double rooms one day I was there and it was enormous with a private bathroom, so if you want to spend the extra cash, or if there's more than one, then that would be a good option. The service was pretty minimal, but then I didn't really need anything while I was there, and when I did speak to the staff they were friendly enough. The area is a short walk to downtown, and you have lots of excellent cafes, shops and restaurants in Back Bay. My top tip for food and shops is Newbury Street. A lovely tree-lined street with old brownstones converted into shops, cafes and restaurants. Walking from one end to the other, near the public gardens end is all up-market designer stores, but keep walking and you go past the usual round of high street stores before hitting the funky end a bit further on.",Good
"Nice surprise to find this gem. Newer hotel or at least appears to be, clean, quiet, professional staff, and would recommend to my friends and family as a nice place to stay. I stay at hotels almost every night of the week and sometimes have concern about hotel conditions and safety, but absolutely nothing to worry about here! Would highly... More",Good
"We have just finished our trip here and all was perfect for my family (we have two children of 4 and 5 years old). We chose a king suite. The king bed was really comfortable. The room is tiny but there is so much to do in San Diego that we did not have to stay in the room other than to sleep. Perfect breakfast. Perfect pool and hot tub. Clean. The only negative point is that the hotel is not really eco friendly... plastic glass, plastic utensils....Well situated (need a car).Dear Marie - Wow! What a wonderful review, we truly appreciate your business and your trust in us. I am very happy to hear that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us and also enjoyed our complimentary deluxe hot breakfast. We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel in the near future. Take care! :)",Good
"We just returned from a 4 night stay at the French Market Inn in New Orleans. What an amazing change (and I usually don't like change when I find a cool hotel) that has been made by the Valentino group! Renovations are a success and the staff is above and beyond (especially Jenna at the front desk). One thing people need to understand when staying at these cool boutique hotels in the quarter...they are old buildings, the rooms are small but well worth every penny. Our room had a king bed and that did bode for a tight room but it faced Decatur Street and we just loved everything about the room. I can't recommend this place enough without realizing that I've just given away one of our favorite places to stay in the quarter.",Good

"Very clean and close to everything San Diego has to offer.Close to the freeway for access to everything. The restaurant had good food where we dined for breakfast and dinner on a few different occasions, Patrick was our server and was very accommodating and personable . The room was very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. The price was more than reasonable and we will stay there again if we are in the San Diego area.Dear Bradstaaf,Thank you so much for your great comments! We are so happy to hear that you appreciated the cleanliness of our property and rooms as well as the value you received. We are glad that you were pleased with our convenient location with easy access to the freeway and close to all that San Diego has to offer. We are also glad that you liked our Seven Seas Caf for both breakfast and dinner, and that Patrick took care of your needs in a personable manner. We will be more than happy to pass the kind words on to him! Thank you again for taking the time to review the Best Western Seven Seas and we welcome the opportunity to be of service to you during your next visit to San Diego.

"This Marriott is right across the street from Rush Medical Center, which is where I had scheduled knee replacement surgery. Many out of towners like myself, who are having surgery stay here, including the rich and famous. I had expected convenience but there was so much more. First, the food is remarkably good and the service was good as well. But what sets this place apart is the staff they are incredibly helpful to and supportive of the patients are are there for anything you need. So if you are coming to Chicago for surgery or other medical care, stay here!Thank you so much for your feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and the food in our dining outlet. Our staff looks forward to accommodating you in the future.",Good
"I personally loved the attention that went into designing this space - and the folks that work there are great! I can see why it gets such good ratings! It has a lot of appeal due to the access to fun areas around San Diego. The price is right, too!There was a drawback to the location that my husband states will be the reason we won't go back. The road noise and traffic on Rosecrans forced us to seek out ear plugs and the only way to watch TV was on a high volume. We didn't feel 100 safe walking to and from coffee shops, etc. In fact, someone leaving a driveway paid no attention to us at all. Everyone on Rosecrans is in some kind of hurry. Not the laid back beach town vibe I was looking for.If you are young and hip enough to pass out with a buzz after the fun bar and pool experience, the road noise may not be a bother.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. Happy to hear you enjoyed our little gem. Unfortunately, some of our rooms do get the road noise, but we always recommend requesting one of our quieter rooms, so that you may have a peaceful night OR there is always your great suggestion of a nitecap or two in our bar :) Thanks again for taking the time to write a review.",Good

"A very nice room. Quiet with a lake view. We appreciated that there were two restaurants, so we didn't have to get in our car to go anywhere. The bed was very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. I liked the balcony and fireplace.These were nice added touches.",Good
"Seriously - I don't need to lie on this update. I was able to take my lab with me to this perfectly beautiful place, they gave me special accomodations and I just go there to visit the mccloud falls and it ended up being the perfect trip. Totally going there again!",Good
"We stayed here for two nights as part of a 16 day road trip.The hotel is nice, all the staff were very polite and attentive. We were a little worried on check in about the fact that our room was on the same floor and directly overlooked the pool and bar area but we shouldn't have been - there was no noise whatsoever and we had a great night sleep. Only downside was we had to keep our curtains closed.......Nice spacious room, comfortable bed, great bathroom and shower, free continental breakfast at the hotel next door and if you sign up as a Kimpton member you get free wifi and a voucher for drinks at the bar.Nice touches were the umbrella and bathrobes for comfort. Great location as a base for San Diego - only downside was the 42 a night parking but we couldn't be bothered with the hassle of finding it cheaper elsewhere.Would go back there again..........................Hello SarahH81,Thank you for the lovely review! Were glad you enjoyed our location and rooms. Well see you back next time! JustinAssistant General Manager",Good
"Hotel is nice. Our room was next to hall bathroom which was annoying and our bathroom door squeaked. Service was very good, Breakfast was a big disappointment. Did not get a chance to use the pool and did not eat at restaurant",Good
"Great value for a great location! Rooms are big and spacious, bathroom is a great size. All rooms come with free wifi which is fantastic, and there is free parking (which we didn't need). If you don't have a car you can catch a bus right at the front or you can walk the short walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Additionally if you want to ride a bike around the city there is a place next door that rents them. The staff are quite friendly and helpful for when asking questions about the city.If we do go back to San Francisco in the future we will return! Thanks for the great stay!!",Good

"Hotel Solamar was a really nice hotel. The rooms were very cute and contemporary. Its kind of dark when you first walk into the hotel itself after being outside in sunny California. I didn't have to interact with the staff often but checking in and out was quick and they were friendly. I was happy that they allowed us to check in early without any problem. Since I'm from Texas, its not the norm to have to pay to park, especially 32 per day. So that was pretty steep and not pleasant. The valet guys were polite and tried to be quick in getting the car. Although I'd have preferred skipping the whole valet thing because I'd have saved money in the constant tips and it would've been faster. But I suspect that this was how it is at all the hotels in San Diego so I couldn't be that disappointed in the parking situation. The beds were comfortable and they had nice flat screen TVs. The rooms were very nicely decorated and I was impressed. The only odd thing was that there weren't any drawers. The bathrooms were also nice. I just love the Aveda toiletries that they provide. One complaint that I do have is that there is a nightclub in the building and around 11pm the music can be heard in the room for a few hours. Luckily I was tired enough to sleep through it but it is very loud. Overall, I wasn't disappointed and I'd probably stay there again but I'd ask for a room as far away from that club as possible.Thank's for your feedback.I am truly sorry that the music from our lounge keep you from a great night sleep. I am happy that your overall experience was positive. Thank's for staying with us.",Good
"I stay here due to the proximity to Disneyland, it's a quick walk to the parks, and because I get the Best Western rewards. If you book enough in advance the prices are in line with the cheaper cost hotels. All BW hotels have decent beds, bathrooms, come with microwave and fridge with a good TV and channels. The housekeeping staff does a good job with the cleaning. They do not offer breakfast, but they do give Denny's breakfast vouchers and they offer a go bag in the morning with an apple, a granola bar, and a small water. I'm usually in too much of a hurry to get to Disneyland to where breakfast doesn't matter anyways. The Stovall's BW is a few hotels closer, but is usually a little more and they charge for parking, but they have a full breakfast. Both are good to stay in. The BW on Ball Rd is nice too, but the walk is further.",Good

"This hotel is perfectly situated for harbor excursions from piers along 12th avenue. Easy walking distance to Piers 73 and 78. The hotel itself is geared towards efficiency. The rooms are small, but clean, modern and comfortable. You are provided with a nice desk console and wardrobe, plenty of charging outlets and an ergonomic chair. I am not sure if any rooms have a direct water view, but my view along 38th () was interesting, and a sliver of the river could be seen. There is also an outdoor terrace of sorts, in the front of the hotel, which I didn't use,but looked like a pleasant place to sit and people watch.'My only complaint is breakfast, which ends at 9:30. I went down at 9 and it was a mob scene. And there were no seats. I ended up at a computer table. I suggest breakfast go until ten, or that they add more seating. At any rate, go earlier for breakfast. Breakfast is the usual Holiday Inn affair. Not gourmet, but adequate.",Good

"I stayed here for four nights this month after flying down to see the MLB All-Star game. I booked my room online and checked in via the Hilton app the night before my arrival. This enabled me to choose my room (I chose one on the 7th floor- the top floor). Accessing the hotel is easy to do, as it is right off of a highway. The location isn't in the greatest area, as there was always heavy traffic when turning back onto the main road leaving the hotel. Dining options on the main road near the hotel aren't great either. Check-in when I arrived was quick and easy and took less than a minute. Everything in the room appeared clean. The beds were extremely comfortable. Every employee at the hotel seemed to enjoy their job and was friendly. The hotel includes an outdoor pool, an exercise room, a guest laundry area, and a business center with two computers and printers. It also has a small area to the left of the front desk that sells a variety of items, including snacks, frozen meals, ice cream, and beverages (including beer). If there was one area the hotel could improve in, it would be having thicker walls. At night, I didn't hear much noise. However, every morning around eight o'clock, voices in rooms around me woke me up and made it hard to sleep. I'm not sure if it was the guests in those rooms or the housekeeping staff, but it seemed to occur every morning I was there. As for noise from airplanes (considering the hotel is close to the airport), the room was quiet late at night, but not so much once the sun came up. All things considered, I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Miami. The rates were very reasonable, especially considering what other hotels in the city were charging. Also, the parking is free.",Good

I have stayed here several times and it's always pleasant and clean. If you are traveling into the Lincoln area this is a great choice. Looks like a Brand Hotel but not the brand price:) Ask for manager Neil he is great and a new papa:),Good
"My husband and I were at the hotel from early December 2015 to late March 2016 along with other co-workers while working in the area.

"This was my first stay at this location. Very nice. Friendly staff, quick check in. Modern, bright and comfortable. I always key in on quality of the beds and HVAC. Both were very nice. Clean rooms. I would happily return.",Good
"The grounds are well-kept and the room nicely appointed and tastefully decorated with a very comfortable bed. More importantly, the staff were friendly and quite attentive which made a nice stay that much more enjoyable. The resort has a very relaxing feel. We tried the Adobe restaurant and we were not disappointed.",Good
"Single best bath tub Ive ever used in my life. Holy hell it was a better bath than the 1400a night Pelican Hill! Decor was great. Staff were amazing. Only downside is the AC was broken and the beds are only just above average. Overall love it. P.S. dont park at the hotel. 24/7 secure parking is one block up at 6th and Market for 38 LESS per night. Glad you enjoyed one of our Jacuzzi rooms, ManagmentBee. Sorry the AC wasn't working. That's definitely a one-off and hope it was fixed quickly. We'll see you next time. Justin- AGM",Good
I went for a girls weekend to watch a football game and didn't know what to expect. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. We were impressed by the size of the rooms they were decently sized and having a mini kitchen really is useful. The complementary breakfast in the morning is a really big added bonus. It is within walking distance to everything and we definitely recommend this hotel.,Good
"Hotel had a great location (by Space Needle) for family vacation to Seattle. Room had two queen beds plus a pull out sofa, so our family of 4 could spread out a bit. Good breakfast buffet included with room. Room cleaning was poor as only one of the two beds was made and we received no clean towels or new shampoo.",Good

"This Hilton Garden Inn is well managed, clean, and close to the airport. In fact it is so close airport it is directly under one of the runway approaches - which is very cool if you like plane-spotting. That being said the noise from landing aircraft was minimal inside the hotel. Good bar and friendly bartender. Breakfast was good and nice attentive servers. The bed was VERY comfortable and room was nicely appointed.Thank you for choosing the HIlton Garden Inn Miami Airport West for your stay in Miami.We appreciate you taking the time to share your review on this site and we lookforward to welcome you back.Kind regards,Amanda GrahamFront Office Manager",Good
"Average breakfast, dated rooms, polyester bedding, but it was quiet, clean, and very close to all Disney parks. Free parking was also nice considering we had to pay 20/day at Disney parks. The hotel does offer free shuttle to Disney, but I think it might be just to Magic Kingdom and only a couple times a day, so it was a lot more convenient for us to drive. Full kitchen also enabled us to eat dinner in the room a few times there's a Publix three minutes away. Would stay there again.",Good
"The hotel was just what we were looking for close to subway stations, shops, restaurants and a few blocks from Times Square. Set close to the fashion district, it may not be based in the busiest of streets, but after long day, sight-seeing or visiting friends. It was a place, my friend and I, were proud to call home for 5 days. When we arrived in New York, it was good to see Jamie smiling and helping us out in reception.The staff were very freindly and nothing was too much bother. Breakfast was a good kick start in the morning, and complimentary web access was avaialble near reception, to look up places for the day ahead.Before booking the hotel I had read reviews, that rooms at this hotel are small, that maybe so. However, although they are quite small, they give you everything you need for a comfortable stay. Good beds, a tv, desk area and a compact bathroom with shower and bath.We definately look forward to returning here in the future. Its clean, comfortable and friendly. What more do you need.",Good
"The hotel does show some wear, it is in the north part of the city and quite some distance from the ocean/beach and other major San Diego attractions. It is clean and comfortable and, the price while high is competitive for the area. We were there on extended family business and remained in the Mira Mesa area 90 of the time for which it was ideally suited. The hotel is surprisingly quite despite being close to the Marine Corps Air Station. I can remember only hearing a plane once while there.I thank the staff for their good work. This will be come our choice hotel for family visit to San Diego.Dear DCMahanThank you for taking the time to review the hotel we appreciate your feedback. If you are going to be in the Mira Mesa or Marine Corps Air Station we are the perfect location. We are located 5-10 minutes away from either location. The planes seldom fly around the area. The majority of their flying happens in October when we have their air show every year. I glad to hear that staff is doing a good job. We look forward to seeing you in the future. Thank you for the feedback.",Good
I really liked this place. Its the little things that make it stand out like the beautiful roses that decorate the parking lot and the friendliness of the staff. I had booked the wrong date thru travelocity and they helped me on how to cancel and gave me a better rate . But Travelocity was very good also!,Good
"We can't say enough about this hotel. This was our third time staying here. We got married in June at this location in one of the garden courtyard areas. Everyone there was so nice and accommodating. We told them we were celebrating our marriage, and they gave us the best balcony room available and a bottle of champagne to celebrate. This will be our go to place anytime we go back to New Orleans. The king size rooms are nice and huge. Definitely upgrade to the deluxe though. We have stayed in a room before that we were not particularly fond of. Just ask the front desk, and they can move you. You cannot beat the location, and the hotel is definitely authentic New Orleans. Love, love, love!Best service ever! Wow, thank you for taking the time to share this excellent review. We can't wait to welcome you back. Congrats!",Good
"From the outside the hotel look like a older hotel but inside has totally been updated on the inside. Our room was very clean and was much larger than expected. The bed was comfortable and we had plenty of pillows. There was even and lounge area in our room. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The only thing is that traffic is horrible around there so either use the free shuttle of ride sharing.Dear Mr. Christopher P, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback. I will definitely share this information with my entire staff.The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request.Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager",Good

"I have been taking my husband downtown as a Christmas Present for the past few years. We have been trying new hotels on each stay. We have been trying all the Kimpton hotels in Chicago and this year we tried the Hotel Allegro. Hotel Allegro has a beautiful art deco theme, rooms are not large but it is downtown Chicago and the space is used effectively. We knew the secret password that got us a couple of free drinks at the bar. The hotel, like the other Kimpton Hotels offers a cocktail hour where they served sparkling wine and spiked hot chocolate. The spiked hot chocolate was super yummy, went back for a mugful the little tasting glass they gave was not going to cut it. Beds were comfy, shower had great pressure. I would stay and reccomend the hotel. If you take the time you can find all sorts of sitting areas to hang out in. Coffee Hot Chocolate bar in the morning. Check out the various packages they have, we got the room and valet parking rate for 160 on a Saturday night.Hello!Thank you for the wonderful review! It looks like you've hit it all! Thanks for staying with us and surprising your husband for Christmas! We're so happy to hear that you enjoyed the spiked hot chocolate! It's perfect for this time of year! We hope to see you and your husband soon!kimptonlove babyitscoldoutsideRachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager",Good
"The whole hotel from the valet, to the lobby, to the hallways, bars and restaurants and especially the room, were exceptional. They were tasteful, clean, roomy and plush. Will be my first choice for subsequent visits.",Good
"My wife and I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel. It is fun, convenient and has an abundance of friendly and helpful staff. The availability of clever games throughout was appreciated. The creative use of common materials, such as street signs folded into chairs and cargo containers was effectively creative.Hello Walter S, I am so glad you found our quirk ! being in such a cool modern space we just cant help but have fun here. I am so glad you found a bit of that here with us. I hope to see you again at the telescope !",Good
"My husband, daughter and I visited Orlando for a funeral. It was a stressful time and we had to book on very short notice. This hotel worked out very well. The beds were comfortable. The rooms clean, fresh and nice looking. Nothing fancy but unpretentious. It's three minutes to the airport so great for early flights. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Everything was fresh and came with the room for an extra 10 and the waitress was really pleasant. The pool looked nice though we didn't have time for a swim. My daughter stayed on the pullout couch. It was not comfortable but she didn't mind and enjoyed the private space. This is not close to the parks so I would not recommend for an Orlando vacation. It is close to downtown, which is experiencing a nice resurgence. There are decent chain restaurants and big box stores (e.g. Petco) within walking distance. We were sorry to hear of the reason for your trip and would like to express our condolences. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about our property and we are glad that everything was conducive to your needs. We would enjoy welcoming you back for a different circumstance next time your travels bring you to our area!",Good
"A surprising alternative to the many over-priced accomodations in Napa. A perfect place for a family, with an attentive and welcoming staff. This is a motel, but surpassed typical motel standards. Everything is nicely painted, clean, and ship shape looking. Housekeeping staff did a great job. We stayed for three nights, and in many motels this would be a long time. At the Chablis Inn we did not have any regrets and would stay there again.",Good
"Hello Travelers! I recently stayed at Homestead Perimeter for 3 weeks and my travel mate and I had a very satisfactory stay. Before coming to Atlanta I checked out the internet for hotels and reviews and decided that the Homestead was the best place to stay for our purposes. After reading some of the reviews we were apprehensive but, never experienced or saw the problems some of the reviewers complain about. We were treated in a cordial southern hospitality manner every time we went to or spoke with office staff. Our quoted rate and the bill we paid were exact. Clean towels and other necessities were plentiful. The grounds were clean, safe and comfortable. Our room was just what we expected. Fellow travelers staying here were pleasant and quiet. The Homestead was very convienent for that part of Atlanta ajacent to the Publix , Rite Aid, fast food. Walking distance to MARTA, just 2 or 3 blocks from the Perimeter Mall.Thank you so very much for your glowing review of Homestead Atlanta - Perimeter. Whenever I read comments like yours it always gives me such great pleasure. My entire staff strives to make every guest's stay totally enjoyable, and our greatest reward is validation that we've done just that. Please know that we would be thrilled to have you again as our guest should your travel needs bring you back to our area. Once again, thanks for all of your very kind words.",Good

"While I thought, initially, that the neighbourhood this motel was in was sketchy, that quickly faded when I realized how good this place was. The front desk staff, Ben, was uber-helpful and friendly, and really made an effort to know my name and my needs. It's very centrally located in Atlanta, with quick access to the MARTA subway system, and was walkable to a lot of different restaurants and sites. The room was nice and clean, and more than serviceable. The price was right too, although there was a mix-up with the pricing. They did however fix it promptly. I was also able to check in early without a charge, which was also a great benefit.",Good
"My DH and I recently stayed here for our anniversary. We are a local couple who just needed to get away for a night. The staff of this hotel was one of the best parts. I cannot remember the name of the front desk attendent when we checked in - maybe Michael But he was great - very helpful on where to dine and drink. He also told us all about the breakfast offered at the hotel and all the other nice ammenities (free breakfast, one of the NICEST pool areas in all of PB!). The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the view was SPECTACULAR! The otel is small which we prefer. It is quiet right on the boardwalk close to great food and nightlife. In the morning we drank our coffee on our balcony and watched the waves roll in. It was an amazing anniversary and one that will not soon be forgotten thank to Ocean Park Inn's great hospitality. We will be visiting again when we can get a night away fron real life!We're elated to hear our hospitality made your anniversary trip so enjoyable and memorable! The staff is also very happy to know you noticed how clean the pool and surrounding area is - our head engineer treats the pool like his own and is very proud of it.

"In a city of hip hotels filled with noise, loud music, breaches of privacy, B-list celebrities (and worse) and expensive prices for cheaply constructed buildings, the Mandarin Oriental is a welcome exception. I've stayed here over 15 times over the past decade but never wrote a review. But it's time to give praise where it's due.First, the location -- on an island across a short causeway from the heart of the Brickell business district, the hotel has beautiful views in all directions. The rooms are spacious, beautifully furnished, extremely comfortable, and with true state-of-the-art support for all of your electronics -- there's a well placed single large panel in the desk area with plugs for chargers, ethernet cables, 3 prong plugs -- everything you can imagine.All the rooms have floor-to-ceiling glass facing the water and city views, balconies, large bathrooms and abundant closet space. I've been in everything from their basic rooms to suites -- all were gracious and comfortable.The two restaurants are excellent, and the buffet breakfast in the Cafe Simbal is exceptionally abundant, everything of highest quality, and with exceptionally broad choices. The pool is a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the bay with outdoor shower and jacuzzi facilities, and the large nearby beach area is quiet, calm and well serviced by staff who are gracious, helpful and unintrusive. The spa is elegant and the exercise room is very large and as good as the most extravagant private facility.All of these types of choices and preferences are matters of personal choice, but I've tried more than my share of South Beach hip places and they were uniformly bad compared to the Mandarin. And because Miami is so spread out, you'll need a car or taxi (as you need no matter where you stay), but the Mandarin is actually very central and equidistant by car to Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, South Beach and Key Biscayne.As chain hotels go, this is as good as any in the US. As a very discerning and experienced traveler with opinions (see my other reviews!), this one deserves its reputation and for the quality of rooms, location, food and service, is fairly priced.",Good
"The hotel is very nice and trendy because its so new. We booked a 12th floor bay view suite for the view. When checking in, they told us it was the best view! Unfortunately. While it shouldve had a great view, there is a massive support beam that runs floor to ceiling in between the foot of the bed and the window. So you cant see the water clearly from your bed. Its like staying in a fixed up boiler room. What a shame and what a thoughtless design. The pillar isnt even nice, its just solid unfinished concrete. Additionally, the hotel is about 3/4 of a mile from Seaport Village so you have to walk a little bit to get to the action. Not a big deal, but still...nicer hotels charge less to stay closer.",Good

5 minutes from Ohare and with a shuttle running every 30 minutes to and from the hotel. This is a nice property for a quick lay over. My room was very clean and staff very hospitable.

"Checking in sort of a nightmare. Rooms were not ready at 2p check in time went out to do some shopping and room still not ready at 4p. (Note: the next 2 days our room wasn't clean until about that time.) Hotel is in safe neighborhood and, while very close to the freeway, once we shut the door, we hardly heard any road traffic and our room was probably closest to the road. Room was not antiseptic, but certainly clean enough. Bathroom tiny but the room itself was fine with a fridge and microwave. Had some issues with keys not working and the pool is bathtub size so don't get your hopes up. Breakfast was about what one would expect and the breakfast area is small but it was never crowded. If you want a clean quiet room at a bargain price, this place fits the bill but don't expect too much. Thank you Bruce for your feedback. Please accept my sincere apologies for the experience you encountered during your stay and for we failed to meet your expectations. I have forwarded your feedback to the front desk staff and management team. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and hope to see you again soon.",Good
"Stayed here for business 1 night in December 2013. Arrived late at night but received a warm welcome and smile from the young lady at the front desk. Promptly gave me my key and off I went to rest and relax. The room was spacious, clean and smelled nice. My favorite part about staying in a Hilton hotel is a Keurig coffee maker. It's like home away from home. The room had a mini fridge which was nice. The bed was comfortable and helped with a good nights sleep. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Near the hotel is a Walgreens and a Starbucks went to both places.Dear Guest dlmyvette, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.

"Looks like a garden with villas but really is a big conference center! It was wonderful not being in a typical corporate-feeling conference hotel. The meeting venue and food were great but so was the room and service. Loved the fresh brand toiletries and frette linens. Comfortable bed. We ate at a few of the restaurants which were also great! Close walking distance to Torrey Pines Gliderport and next door to Salk institute. There is a free shuttle provided by the hotel for destinations within 5 miles, which we used to get to down town La Jolla. Shuttle driver was really nice and gave us recommendations on what to do in the area.The only negatives were the gym, which was much smaller than I expected with poor ventilation, and the pillows were smaller than standard pillows which was a little annoying. I didn't pay for this stay so I can't say much regarding value for money but as a conference venue I've never been to a better one.",Good

"In the heart of the theatre district this is one of the oldest hotels in Chicago. and is ideally placed to tour downtown.if you arrive at O'Hare International Airport there's no need to pay a high taxi fare (unless perhaps you are loaded with bags!) Use the CTA train from Terminal 2 which, for 5 dollars takes you to Clarke and Lake where the hotel is situated just down the street, a 3 minute walk. This worked well for us.The hotel is clean and rooms comfortable but is showing signs of age in some of the dcor but perhaps this adds to its old world charm. Staff were pleasant and helpful and complimentary coffee in the lobby was a nice touch.There is no restaurant at this hotel but there is an arrangement with the restaurant next door. We were catching a night train so didn't get to try the breakfast.The bed was comfortable and was welcome after a long flight.Complimentary dressing gowns in the bathroom offered that little extra luxury.The mini bar was extensively stocked but like all hotels, expensive!I'd certainy recommend this hotel as a base for exploring as anywhere downtown is within easy walking distance and local transport for further afield is easy.Good Afternoon,A charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!",Good
"Was a little worried at first as pictures can be very deceiving. The pool picture does not do justice. I was thrilled with my room! And the staff were great. Lonnie is a gem! The location was perfect! In the middle of everything! I would definitely go back to the French Market Inn again, and I recommend it. My room was a little loud as it faced out onto the street and I'm a super light sleeper. Could here traffic and the boats on the Mississippi River (the river is across the road on other side of parking lot). Next time I would try a room facing the courtyard.We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay at the French Market Inn. Thank you for sharing your feedback. Sorry to learn of the inconvenience you experienced with the street noise. We look forward to welcoming you back for quieter stay in one of our courtyard rooms!",Good
"We booked this hotel online the day before our 3 night stay. Although we booked on a discounted online site, we still found the price to be quite high, but all the hotels in San Francisco were quoting high prices at the time. I had been watching prices for our dates for a month or so and never found a reasonable deal in SF. It seems that hotel prices in San Francisco have risen significantly recently and with a 16 tax on hotel stays in the city, the prices are higher still. That said, we LOVED the location of this hotel. It was close to the Moscone Center where my husband was attending a conference and close to the Museum of Modern Art and Ferry Building which I visited. We had a car, but just kept it in the hotel garage and used Uber to get around for longer distances during our stay. Using Uber was quick, convenient, and the one reasonably priced thing we found in San Francisco. The charge for valet parking at the hotel garage was 49 per day, lower than prices for valet parking that we had seen at some other SF hotels. There was not a self parking option at the hotel garage, although there were public garages not far away that had a 36 per day rate. The hotel garage appeared a safer and more secure option to us, knowing that there is a high rate of car break-ins in SF (see a recent NY Times article about this). The staff at the hotel were helpful and very friendly, always greeting us pleasantly as we came and went. The bed in our room was very comfortable, the wifi worked well enough, and after asking, we were able to add more devices to the wifi for no additional charge. There was a coffee machine in the room, but it was only stocked with one capsule of caffeinated coffee and one capsule of decaf. When I asked for additional capsules, they brought them to our room, but I had to ask each day and at the price we were paying I would think they could have offered at least 2 caffeinated capsules per room. I found that I really needed the caffeinated version after being woken up numerous times, starting at 3am by garbage trucks and other loud street noise. Our room faced the street, and I'm guessing that this wouldn't be a problem with a room facing the inner courtyard. I would happily stay at this hotel again if I could get a quieter room facing the inner courtyard. The location is just hard to beat.Dear swissmiss001,Thank you very much for taking time and submitting a review after your stay at Galleria Park Hotel. Not only are we appreciative of your review, but our future guests will benefit form it as well!To begin, I would agree with your statements about our location. Being in such close proximity to the convention center is great, however that also means we are very close to some of the most well known SF landmarks. Valet parking is a great service our guests enjoy as it means that they do not have to go through the hassle of finding parking in our congested city. For future reference, if street noise is a concern please request an interior facing room - as we wish our guests to be as comfortable as possible.We are very appreciative of the compliments of our staff and hope to see you return on your next trip to San Francisco.Sincerely,Jordan Whitney",Good

"My wife and I had a fabulous time at the Westin Nanea. The accommodations, staff, concierge, and location exceeded our expectations. The property is conveniently located in north Kaanapali, and is close to the shopping and farmers market of Honokowai.

Stephen was an especially helpful concierge, recommending excellent restaurants and activities, and making reservations.Aloha Joe D,We appreciate you taking the time out to provide your review of your recent stay here with us at The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas.

"This hotel is situated in the centre of Old Town with very close proximity to restaurants etc. Also 5 minutes walk to the tram station with frequent service to San Diego. This is a very attractive hotel, modern but built in the old Spanish style. Not recommended if you have difficulty with stairs as this is built on multiple levels. Let down a bit by the breakfast as there is very limited choice of hot food, but there are plenty of local cafes for breakfast.",Good

"I loved my stay at The Westin for a conference. It was within walking distance of the Gaslamp area and convenient to the water and ferry to Coronado as well as the trolley. The staff was amazing - everyone I encountered went out of their way to be attentive and nice. The bed and linens are super soft. There was a medium sized pool and hot tub. Modern and clean building and I loved the fresh water and fruit in the lobby. Plus, one afternoon there was a happy hour with wine and cheese for free. That was a nice touch!DawnNYC3 I love hearing how you enjoyed all parts of your stay, from our convenient downtown location to friendly staff and the Westin Heavenly bed.

"The Vagabond is now allowing children of all ages!!! if you plan on bringing your kids, ask for one of the four corner rooms which have two double beds, (since everything else is king size beds)... otherwise you children have to sleep on one king bed..bring snacks, food and water for kids (no kids menu)... the rooms are spacious enough, just not too many drawers space (only three). full closet, blow dryer, ironing board, etc. for under 200 bucks a night, you can't beat this place!! the food is fantastic. I recommend renting a car and doing little day trips, but no matter what, there's nothing like the Vagabond pool vibe. I could live here!!SO gald you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you back at the Vagabond soon. We changed our policy of no children under 13 earlier this year and we have more families now staying with us and enjoying the pool and the floaties !",Good
"We found the General Manager, Patrick to give great assistance during our 8 day stay. The location is great for the city and convention area. The rooms have been renovated in the older area and renovation was taking place while we were there not causing any disturbance.

"Had an extended weekend stay to celebrate big anniversary! This hotel looked very nice and had a perfect locale so we took a chance. We made a great choice! The hotel is perfectly clean and very large. We got a suite with a bay view and it was perfect. We even had a view of the famous red Public Market sign! No trouble locating Pike's Place with that view! Room was spotless and bed super comfy. Pillows are little lacking too soft, no support but we still slept really well. Check in was a breeze. When they heard it was our 25th, the gal comped our valet for the entire stay and sent up a bottle pinot grigio! We appreciated her thoughtfulness and enjoyed the wine. Bathroom is luxurious and spotless. Huge shower and separate huge tub were glorious! First time spending a significant amount of time in Seattle and we loved every minute. Thanks Hyatt, we'll be back!",Good

Loved The Vertigo! Rooms were unique. Hotel was very clean. It's not a 5* hotel but staff was so very helpful. Free wi-fi in the room. Very nice location! Walked to chinatown and Union Square. The only complaint: We were offered a breakfast with our rate and the yogurt was warm. They just had a boxed breakfast sitting in the back room where It should be in the fridge. It's better to go 2 doors down to the breakfast place. It's inexpensive and the food was good. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The men that worked the front desk were the best. They could answer anything and were very helpful. Can't wait to go back someday!,Good

"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. We travelled with our kids aged 4 and 6. The rooms were clean, spacious and well maintained. The beds were great and all of us slept well. The hotel provided vouchers towards breakfast at the adjoining restaurant. The restaurant was great and we used the vouchers towards whatever breakfast we ordered.

"This is a really modern hotel bang, smack in the centre of the great city of San Diego, California. And because it has most of anything you need at pretty high quality, it is not cheap. We stayed for two days and enjoyed both beertasting and whiskey/whiskytasting for only 5 each. The bartenders, John and Ben, did a fine job! Breakfast is not included, but it's not very expensive and you have lots of choices. We didn't try the restaurant. They served us good hashbrowns and perfect eggs which were impressively fast on our table. Good selection of teas and real freshly squeezed orangejuice. Staff looks happy, not just polite. Great room, loved the chocolate! Fine beds, fridge and microwave in the livingroom and tv both there and in the bedroom. Modern fascilities for charging phones etc. Even if you need an extra plug, it's already there. Any niggles Well, parking in cities may be difficult, but 42 per night with valet and 35 without seems to me a bit over the top, the room comes at a price so it ought to be half the price for guests. After all, just a few blocks up you could park for free on the street. But will I stay there again if in SD Yes, of course.Thank you for your review and for taking the time to let us know about your stay! We are happy you had a great visit to the resort and look forward to more vacationgreatness with your family.",Good
"This is not like a traditional BB. What you do get: a big room (we had a queen size bed on the top floor) with private bathroom, a continental breakfast, a fabulous location (5 mins from the Public Gardens, 10 mins from Boston Common and in the heart of the Back Bay district)What you don't get: any interaction with the owners (they're all staff), a sense of being important to the business, TV in your room (not necessary, but. Some probably want that) or wireless in your room.The college club is primarily run for the benefit of its patrons and they seem to believe that holding talks., breakfasts and various fundraisers is the raisin d'tre of the establishment. So, you can feel a bit like an add on to the place as a guest. The staff are pleasant enough when you engage them, but don't expect them to be terribly welcoming without encouragement. The Club has hit on the idea that renting the rooms out will help defray their costs, but frankly the guests are not their focus.However, accept that for what it is (get used to having to use the lifts when there's a meeting on as the stairs are closed to guests) and embrace the location, size of rooms and the value. It's all good, you just. Won't find a host waiting on your every whim.",Good

"Aloft in Downtown Dallas is affordable, and the decor is hip modern (and slightly cheesy, but refreshing and beautiful in contrast to the souless reds, beiges and florals of most chain hotels). The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom is stocked with Bliss products. We ate at the bar on our second stay because it was kind of late and we were driving a Penske ... I'd find somewhere else to eat next time. It wasn't gross, it just tasted like it came out of a freezer. Overall I'm fond of this place and wish Aloft would replace the Days and Holiday Inns of the world.",Good
"On Tuesday, December 10, 2013 I pull in to the Fairfield Inn Marriott in Philadelphia with a flat tire. I was on my way to take my last final for the semester, I walked into the lobby and asked was there anybody to help change a tire. The agent at the count was an angel, and said, sure give me a minute. Then a young man came over to me and introduce himself as John. John said, I'm here to help you with you car, at that point we both walk out to my truck. John, asked if I had a jack or anything else to take a tire off, well I didn't. John with so much patience and great customer service, said Don't worry I'll find one. Then John and Reuben came over as a team and blessed me to get back on the road and on time to school for my final. I am so very thankful and blessed for that experience at the FairField Inn.

"Stayed at the Ritz for 3 nights last weekend with husband and daughter. The club level service was amazing, as was service all over the hotel, from the check -in to the door men to the people who cleaned the room. I used the concierge several times, and was able to get into a restaurant that showed up as nothing available on Open Table by using the Ritz' contacts.The club had (alcoholic) drinks available all day , or at least every time we stopped. The bites sized portions served at the pre dinner hour were plentiful and had great variety.Breakfast was nice. Would have been nice to include an egg option,maybe scrambled eggs or something. We had bagels with smoked salmon or oatmeal most mornings. The coffee was good as well.The only thing that was not perfect was that each bed nobly had to flattened out down pillows on it , so we asked for a couple extra which were brought up immediately with a smile.Thank you to the Ritz for a memorable stay !",Good

The location was a fairly short distance from all of the main parks/malls in Orlando, without all of the craziness of being right in the middle of everything. It was within walking distance of bone fish grill and a short drive from a bunch of other cool restaurants.Some reviews had mentioned construction noise which worried me initially, but we stayed there on a Friday and Saturday night and didn't hear a thing.

We were moved to a third room with a sink that didn't work very well, but we were so tired of moving we decided to deal with it. We came back from dinner and found no wine and it was brought up only after we had called. The final straw was the lack of room cleaning. The maid service didn't stop by despite our calls for 2 days and would only pick up towels and most days cleaning service didn't show up until 4-5 in the afternoon.

"We stayed at this hotel for one night before leaving on a cruise to Alaska. Let me start by saying we are HUGE Marriott fans, and have always had extremely pleasant stays at the majority of properties. Sadly, this particular Marriott may be independently owned or at the very least poorly managed which resulted in us having a horrific stay. We booked four rooms in total for our group. My family had two of the rooms. We returned after a wonderful dinner at a nearby restaurant and went to our room about 10:00 pm, with our main objective being a good night's sleep so that we were ready to leave for our cruise bright and early. Imagine our surprise when the room next door had a barking dog in it. No people...just a barking dog. We called the front desk and they apologized and told us they were so sorry that this was happening. They told us that this was a service dog which was why he was allowed in the room. They then went on to say that they had the same problem the night before, had spoken to the guests and the guests assured them they would not leave the dog alone again in the room. (So this begs the question why does someone need a service job if they don't take them out with them If a person needs a service dog, shouldn't the dog be with the person.) Aside from that, however, management knew they had a pesky situation and didn't deal with it. EXCUSE ME They knew this was a problem, they assigned a person to the room next door anyway REALLY Management came up, knocked on the door, no answer, just a barking dog who was now really agitated. This barking continued until 1:00 in the morning. We called the front desk again and again. They couldn't do anything about it as the guests were not home. The hotel was full so changing rooms was not an option and why should we have to move anyway In the morning we found breakfast for all four of our group's rooms slid under the door. Sorry--we had made plans to go to Pike's Market to explore and have breakfast before getting to the ship for our cruise. We requested a refund of points for the one room we booked on points and requested a refund for the cost of the other room. The manager informed us he was not authorized to refund our money or points. We dealt with Marriott Rewards to get our points refunded however, we were not ever able to get a refund of our cash account as the manager felt the breakfasts equalled the cost of our room---however since we didn't use the breakfasts we were not compensated at all. So why even give them one star They recommended a wonderful restaurant nearby that our entire family enjoyed. I will return to Seattle, I will NEVER stay in this hotel unless I hear that new management has taken over.Dear Guest,Thank you for spending the time to share your experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union.

"Old motel style , recently remodelated but dirty, stinky , stains in the linnens, 1000 year old mattress , expensive ,just not worth it .Dear recent guest,I'm sorry to read your review and hear that you did not enjoy your stay in one of our poolside/putting green area rooms. Although these are only 2-story buildings with exterior access, most of our guests enjoy the patios and balconies these rooms have overlooking the golf putting green or the swimming pool. There are, however, 2 rooms in those buildings that do not have a balcony. I would like to follow up on your stay to check the room and check the mattress. All of our rooms throughout the entire hotel had new premium, Sealy Celestial Plush mattresses put in them, so I would like to go in and check your mattress to see if it needs replacing. I have also forwarded your comments regarding the linens to our Executive Housekeeper.

"Based on the website I had high expectations for The Annex at the Chelsea. Maybe if I had booked a room at The Chelsea instead of the Annex I would have been more satisfied. The bed, as advertised, was comfortable, but that was about it as far as the luxuries promised on the website went. No bedside lamp or clock, a large blank space - complete with hooks/nails - where something had hung on the wall, a chunk of plaster missing from the ceiling in the bathroom, tepid, low pressure shower, unpainted section on the bathroom door where a mirror once had hung, no lock on the sliding door to the balcony.

"We have stayed at this property for years and loved it, but noticed that it was going downhill over the past couple of years. After our last stay, we were so disappointed that we decided to try a new property for our next vacation. Based on our last stay, we have the following comments: * Pool area: Very few lounge chairs, most of which are broken. This is not a new problem...it has been ongoing for years. Smoking is allowed in the enclosed pool area, which poses a health and safety hazard especially for small children. During our last stay, there was a man that parked himself at one of the tables all day and smoked cigars. Since we were travelling with our 1 year old, we asked if he wouldn't mind refraining from smoking while we were with our infant, but he continued to smoke. Since smoking is allowed in this area, the hotel chose not to take action. After moving, we were still in the path of the smoke, plus another guest chain smoking cigarettes. There is a seating/table area just outside of the enclosed pool area that would be better if guests need to smoke. Perhaps management could consider making the enclosed pool area non-smoking, replace the broken lounge chairs and offer more seating. The pool itself was great, clean and child friendly.* Evening meal: This was the most noticeable decline. Almost every night offered a meal with cheese, with no alternative for those allergic or lactose intolerant. We had individuals in our party, along with other hotel guests who were unable to participate in the evening meal due to allergies. Previously, whenever the entree offered cheese, the salad bar was a garden salad with a variety of add-ons (including cheese on the side). The salad bar has since disappeared. During our last two stays, both the entre and salad contained cheese and was offered at least 3 times per week. It would have been nice to return to the hotel and enjoy a casual meal with our family and other guests after a long day out. Since you're provided with a menu for the week, we knew in advance when we had to eat out or pick-up dinner. Perhaps management could consider limiting the cheese entrees to once or twice a week (as in previous years) and offering a salad bar and breadsticks (without cheese).* Breakfast: In previous years, the hot breakfast was very good with variety on a daily basis, but would now consider it between average and poor. The variety has declined with the same offering on consecutive days. When cheese eggs and grits were offered, there was no substantial alternative. We've also noticed that Styrofoam plates were often substituted for real plates over the past couple of years at both breakfast and the evening meal.On the positive side, the hotel is in a great location. We loved that it was away from the busy areas and offered a quiet stay. The rooms are large and for the most part clean. The furnishings have seen better days, are not terribly comfortable and small for a family, but okay for the amount of time spent in the room. The staff was great - at check-in and breakfast.We will miss the Homewood, but can no longer justify staying at this property. The cost has also increased over the years although the cost to include meals may be used to justify the price increase, it wasn't worth the additional cost (as per above) as the meals lacked variety, did not consider allergies/intolerances and were overall substandard. We just returned from our vacation at the new property and have to say that we will not be returning to the Homewood. The new property was fabulous - larger suites, the pool area was clean and spacious with a significant amount of seating and the entire complex was non-smoking. We felt that we spent our vacation at a resort and were pampered. The best part is that we saved over 30 per night in comparison to the Homewood for the same time period.",Bad

They must be miserable with their lives, but they should not take their misery out on customers. This hotel is located in one of the prime areas in Atlanta, near a few big corporations, and it's unfortunate that you have these classless women, who are both extremely unprofessional working at the front desk at this particular location. They are a bad representation of your company -- no class at all. Two bad apples ruins the bunch. I give this place two stars.

"Please DO NOT book this place. As soon as I got there, I felt scared. However, I couldn't leave because I couldn't find an affordable place due to a convention going on. I thought that I would spend all day doing tourist stuff, and just come here to sleep, but it was a nightmare! There are a bunch of homeless people, drunk, high, suspicious etc around the area. I'm from a country with the highest crime in the World and I have been in many cities, but I have never felt so scared. There are trash bags in the stairs and they smell like pee. The rooms smell like weed and smoke furthermore, the smell of cleaning chemicals were worst. I didn't see bed bugs however, there were hairs in the sheets. It feels like they never changed them. The shower didn't work. I heard two men next to our bedroom having loud sex. I saw 3 transsexual men in the room downstairs in underwear.

"Sure - its a boutique hotel with a great location and offers complimentary breakfast. But Ive never encountered issues like this before in all my extensive travels. My check-in and check-out each took over 10 minutes, blaming slow computer issues while I watched guests being served faster at the adjacent desk. At check out, the front desk couldnt even print my folio so I could review and approve the charges. The hotel is made of two buildings if youre in the second building its just across a small patio. However this patio is used as the hotels staging area for extra linens and especially the dumpsters. So every time we needed to reach our room, we had to walk through horrific trash odors. On this trip, I booked two rooms. Upon arrival, The first rooms toilet wouldnt flush which means 1) it didnt flush for the cleaning crew and 2) the cleaning crew did noting to report and repair. When we came back to the room after the repair, toilet water was everywhere all over the floor and the maintenance guy used one of our towels to drag around the floor and left it in the bathroom. GROSS. In the second room, on our first night I pulled down the bedsheets and was appalled to find a lot of food crumbs and hair from the prior occupants. It was quite evident. GROSS. When I called the front desk, the staff informed me that no one else was available to change our bedding. She had a formal response but I could tell shes just going through the motions. So I asked for new sheets to change it myself. I do commend the hotel manager for calling me back the next morning, sounding genuinely concerned, and offering other incentives to rectify the cleanliness issue. But at this point, the hotel staff doesnt reflect the same professionalism or attitude, and I know we wont be returning here.Thank you for your feedback. On behalf of our hotel, please accept my apologies for failing to exceed your expectations regarding the check-in and out process, poor service, and lack of cleanliness. These are things we must work on to ensure we continue to provide an exceptional stay experience for each guest. We appreciate the honest feedback and hope you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations on a future visit.",Bad
"Weve stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel a hand full of times over these past 10+ years. It's a nice quaint property. My wife and I were booked to stay there this last weekend (6/29-7/1/2018). However, upon confirming our reservation online last week, I noticed that a new Urban Amenity Fee fee was added and my new stay total was increased by almost 50. I was not contacted when this fee was imposed. I inquired as to what additional amenities this fee would be providing, above and beyond what was already offered at the hotel. Unfortunately, the General Manager Suzie Yang didn't feel it was necessary to respond. So, I cancelled and will not patronize this property again. It seems San Francisco boutique hotels feel their properties are worth the extra fee. Why not just raise the daily rate instead of adding deceitful fees We, instead, booked at the Hilton Union Square on O' Farrell Street. The Hilton was not only less expensive, they don't charge this ridiculous and underhanded Urban Amenity Fee. The Hilton has MANY more amenities and is actually located closer to Union Square. There are a multitude of restaurants and bars in the area, unlike the Galleria Park.Dear David S,We are deeply saddened to hear the Urban Amenity Fee has caused you to make the decision to stay elsewhere. We instituted this fee with the new year 2018 as a means to provide extra benefits for our guests.The 20 nightly charge allows us to deliver far behind the included amenities from the past. With our nightly sipping hour, we have introduced the service of gin martinis on top of the wines, WiFi access has been upgraded to higher speeds for all guests, all local and long distance phone calls are now available with no extra per usage costs, we now have phone chargers as well as portable power banks for our guests to utilize during their stay, water bottles are now provided without the high cost of the mini bar, and we now have passes available to be used at the 24 Hour Fitness studio. Our belief is to be transparent regarding this fee, which is why we disclose the added cost for our guest at the time of booking, in the confirmation email and once again reiterated at the time of check-in.We hope you will reconsider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you back to San Francisco.With warm regards,Jeffrey RosenkrantzAssistant Front Office Managerjrosenkrantzjdvhotels.com",Bad

I forwarded the confirmation email to them and asked them why they charged me, the general manager wrote back that he did the research, and because the reservation was never cancelled on their end, it wasn't considered cancelled, and I was being charged as a no show. He did, however offer me a credit towards a one night stay if I come to Napa in the next two years, which I won't. Needless to say, I'm disputing the charge with my bank.",Bad

"I have stayed at this Drury Inn every other year when I visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras Season. This year was no different... To make a long story short- Drury Inn charged me for two rooms but failed to let me know that upon arrival or checking in the hotel (I had apreviously called the hotel to cancel the reservation FYI). After I noticed the charge on my account I called and spoke with the manager Patrick to reverse the charges. He was super rude, loud talking over me, and had an I dont care attitude. He stated that he would fax in the necessary paperwork to my bank as they requested via email.( that was a Sunday) Monday went and still no funds-Tuesday came and still no funds. At this point my automatic withdrawals started to come out of the account. Which enabled my account to go in the negative and it set a domino effect. I checked in on Saturday and my bank froze my account due to suspicious fraud so I wasnt able to get any money off my account (but it didnt matter because Drury Inn had it all wrap up). Tuesday before I left I spoke with my bank and they told me they never received the proper paperwork so I went to the front desk and spoke with Jaime and she faxed the proper info over for me. Not even 30 minutes later my bank called me and said they received the paperwork and the funds are credited to my account. Now on to the housekeeping- our room had not been cleaned the entire time we were there- which was a Saturday through a Tuesday. Yes the trash was emptied and the beds covers had been pulled over( which I had an issue with because the first day the sheets I had had urine stains on them) after I returned back to the room I asked if someone could come change my sheets. When I returned I asked the front desk if it was taken care of and they stated yes (what they didnt know is that I put a quarter in the middle of the bed under the covers). When I came to the room it was still there. The entire I was there no one vacuum the floor and I had to call everyday to ask for towels - the minimum required towels was not left in my room after cleaning it. I had a few questions and concerns for the manager Patrickbut he blew me off, loud talking me, his exact words were you did this so deal with it. Tuesday morning I attempt email to contact the manager Slade about the situation just to let him know that my bank stated they never received the authorization to reverse funds but he never called me back and I called him at 8:22 am. Yes I went down to the front desk and Jaime took care of it but he was avoiding me because he did not want to handle the situation. His exact words were you would have to call Patrick because he knows the situation and I dont have anything to do with it since he already knows the story. The crazy thing is I actually love this hotel but I wont ever be staying here again when I come to New Orleans. Talk about unprofessional and unable to handle a situation! By the way if I could give a negative 22 on the score I would. All weekend I was suppose to be enjoying the festivities for my birthday but I had to continuously run up behind Drury Inn for answers.

"Although the lobby of the hotel is nice, beyond that is a dated, tired hotel. We arrived earlier than check-in so went up to the pool deck. Lounge chair covers were stained in the private seating areas. Main deck chairs were old and dingy. Cigarette butts from the night before were still on the pool deck. Check in finally came at 3:30. There were over 55 people in line waiting and two people behind the desk checking us in. When we finally got our room in the Annex, we quickly turned around and went back down to the lobby to change it. First off, the elevator to the Annex is behind the desk of the diner and it looks like it was once the service elevator. We heard the Annex had been an old Holiday Inn. The hallway lights were partially burned out, the carpet was frayed and dated and the room smelled like disinfectant and the carpet was damp (don't know with what). The wall had a hole in it the dresser drawer was cracked and falling apart and the bathroom tiles were broken in spots. Our next room had a nice balcony with a view of the spa pool in the same worn out Annex. The spa pool was dirty and were were told that someone had thrown a glass bottle into it a couple of days back and they were waiting for a diver to come and take out the pieces of glass so they could clean it. The room didn't smell but the sliding door to the balcony was off the track so it wouldn't open and the wall had a missing large picture (someone had painted around it at one point and you could see the outline of the picture) and there was a large hole in the wall that had been covered up with electrical tape. The only bright spot was Bob, the maintenance person, who brought us a painting to cover the wall and fixed our door. Obviously the hardest working man at the Chelsea! All in all, the worst hotel room I've ever stayed in and will never return to the Chelsea. I live outside of Philadelphia and travel to Atlantic City a lot. This was my worst trip to date.",Bad
"The front desk staff was wonderful and as helpful as can be. This was especially true, when our room had mold on the windows and drapes and smelled of damp. We were immediately moved to the only other available room, which, unfortunately also had mold (this time in bathroom) and damp. It was supposed to be a more expensive room because it overlooked St Charles Street, which under cover of night seems to have lots of inebriated individuals and street pharmacists doing business. We couldn't use the elevator for a short time after the ceiling fell in on another guest and had to be repaired. The bed was comfortable and would have contributed to a good nights sleep except for the damp smell. Both the room we started with and the room we eventually slept in were a bit small for two twin beds and a family of four with teenagers.The staff made sure the rest of our four-night reservation was cancelled and let us keep our car in the secured parking lot while we explored the French Quarter the next day even after we had checked out. They were helpful despite our unpleasant stay due circumstances beyond their control. Because of the helpfulness and friendliness of the front desk staff, I wish that I could give this hotel a higher rating, but as we could not even stay past the first night of our reservation (and then only because it was late and dark and we had no other place to go), I could not recommend this hotel.David,I'm very sorry we did not exceed your expectations during your stay.

"Stayed here in the Spring of 2012. The location is great for walking around the Old Town area, and conveniently located to drive most places in San Diego. I think this place has a bit of arrogance in the way their run their business, though. When we arrived to move into our room with bay views, we got shoveled in a dirty, smelly room in the far upper corners of a building facing a park. I called the office and asked why we were paying for a bay view and got this room. We had to haul our luggage back down to the parkade and drive all the way back to the office to talk to them. They seemed quite upset that we were questioning the room we got they tried again with a room directly across from the stairwell facing a wall, but we refused that room as well. Their third try was this is the last room we have, which we took. It did face the bay, but was a corner room with the stairwell right in front of the door, which made it a little noisy when people's children were running up and down the stairs and breezeways. It was quite a big larger than the first room they tried to put us in, though. When I asked why we didn't get the room we had booked months in advance, the response was we're full. Huh Stay was OK because we didn't have to engage with the staff again until we checked out. Lots of steps and climbs up and down the road if you're in the upper buildings. Restaurant staff on the arrogant side as well. Must be catchy at this hotel! Parking is horrible - don't bring anything bigger than a Ford Fiesta! Wouldn't stay here again. Sadly, they have a great location, but really indifferent, slightly arrogant, almost rude staff. I'd head for Coronado next time!",Bad

We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor. We are sorry this was an inconvenience for you. Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments with us.Kind Regards Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff",Bad

"I decided, since I was dining at Scalini's and attending an Il Divo concert at the Cobb Energy Center, to stay nearby at the Renaissance versus driving home. In addition, I would meet with friends for brunch on that side of town the next afternoon. When I attempted to use the shower the next morning, I encountered a dollar-sized dark brown spider. Upon checkout, I mentioned my difficulty to the desk clerk whose attitude was dismissive. No one else was in line. After all, one thinks if there is one spider, there must certainly be others. I did receive a sorry, see ya next time response from the General Manager based on a hotel-based review. That does nothing after not having the ability to use the room as anticipated, not to mention my fear of spiders, especially the brown recluse spider. Please excuse me for having a reasonable expectation of being able to bathe without incident before going to Sunday Brunch. This incident made an otherwise pleasurable stay become a disaster. Also, I had intentions of using the hotel shuttle for my evening liaisons but was discouraged by the valet because there was a possibility of being disappointed with one van and 500 guests.I am very sorry about your experience and would like to discuss this with you in more detail. Please call me at your convenience at 770 303-3186.",Bad
"Now like most reasonable people whove traveled a lot, we understand when you make a special request, motels cant always meet them. Were okay with that.What were not okay with is when motel proprietors make up silly excuses to avoid honoring advertised claims. And were also not okay with being threatened with refusal of service. Thats exactly what happened to us here.This was to be our 36th hotel stay in almost six months of travel across North America, and our first experience with the Motel 6 chain. It will also be our last.We booked a week prior to our stay through the Motel 6s national website, requesting a room with a fridge in our booking comments. The national (mobile) website lists an amenity for this motel as Free microfridge/some rooms. We received a confirmation booking email from Motel 6, showing our rate and our request.We read the statement Free microfridge/some rooms as some rooms (not all), have free mini-fridges. On check in, we were presented with a credit card charge that exceeded the amount in our confirmation email. On querying the difference, it was firstly explained as sales tax. Now whilst we mightnt be actuaries, even we could see the difference far exceeded any sales tax value and on querying further it became obvious there was a charge for the fridge. Sometimes misunderstandings and miscommunications occur. And were reasonable people willing to overlook issues if theres a valid explanation or compromise. This motel refused to honor the free part of the statement, offering that to us for an additional charge and suggesting that as it wasnt their personal website, there was no obligation on them to do so. The comedy routine got better though.We were asked for and provided evidence of our booking, and of the statement on the Motel 6 website (it was more a demand as in what website says that). The gentleman we dealt with was not prepared to compromise on this point however. He was insistent on making his point, which simply was that the rate in his computer system for rooms with fridges, was a higher rate.That he was rude, threatening and unwilling to compromise on such a minor point, and with such unreasonable excuses made us wonder if we were on one of those reality comedy shows you know the ones where people are deliberately rude and antagonistic, and then the camera crew rushes out and surprises you and everyone laughs. We saw no camera crew however and the comedy routine continued with him suggesting we cant just give things away. In our view, and for most other reasonable people, failing to honor advertised claims amounts to misleading and deceptive conduct. Giving an unreasonable excuse to disassociate a chain-branded property from its national brand simply to avoid honoring a small commitment demonstrates a lack of integrity. We also contacted Motel 6s national office via their website about our issue. On the first occasion they misread our concern, seeing it simply as being we asked for a fridge and didnt get one. On the second occasion, we received exactly the same worded, trained-monkey, form-letter response including (the almost condescending): the experience as you described, concerns us deeply. And the promised action on both counts Well send your comments to our Management Team for their review. Interpreted as were not going to do anything with your comments but hey, thanks for wasting your time and effort!We dont appreciate or accept this type of behaviour, and chose to take our business elsewhere. And were no longer waiting for the camera crew to appear.",Bad
"We normally stay at Best Western Hotels but will never stay at this one again. If you complain or ask for something, they'll ignore you. The room smelled which leads me to believe it wasn't clean.

We would have moved to another hotel if we would of had the time!Dear Terric890I am sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience while staying at hotel. I am sorry that you were made to feel ignored. I will be talking with our staff about your experience and we will make sure that it does not happen again.

"What a disappointing stay- fell far below expectations, which weren't so high to begin with. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. Otherwise, I found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.The room was comfortable and generally fine, in terms of condition, apart from the surprising lack of a safe! Having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. The room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. Surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingBut my biggest beef was the breakfast, which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. Two of the three mornings, there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. The overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.",Bad
"This property is nice and clean in an off the beaten path area of Seattle. If you're trying to book a room with a corporate rate, beware. I've been staying here just about every week for the last 9 months, and they still blackout corporate rates every chance they get. They refuse to honor customer loyalty, and make booking rooms here consistently impossible. They like to charge you more for the executive level, which is a load of garbage because they're just rooms at the top of the hotel with free cereal and water bottles. I'll be glad when I don't have to stay at this property anymore, just because of how difficult they make the booking process. I've had to stay outside the city and drive over 1 hour each way because they refuse to honor corporate rates at random times. The staff isn't great. it's almost like they have this attitude that they're a top of the line luxury hotel in Seattle, which isn't the case. Definitely wouldn't recommend this property to business travelers. If you're a family and can throw down some serious cash for an unimpressive hotel in a crappy part of town then go for it.Dear bpcole,I am so sorry that you were dissatisfied with your stay. Please contact us directly at the hotel. We can further discuss your experience. You may call us at 206 254 0500.

"My flight was delayed and I arrived late into San Francisco.As the reservation had been made by our corporate travel agent I asked to add my Joy of Life club number. The somewhat unfriendly front desk agent informed me I couldn't do this as only online reservations were eligible. I took the elevator to to 4th floor to find I had been assigned a room facing Bush street on the 4th floor. The main issue was it was opposite the stairs and elevator, which meant lots of noise. I returned to the front desk but was informed they could not change rooms as they were sold out. Needless to say I didn't get the best nights sleep.I travel to San Francisco several times a year but will not be staying at the Rex or any other Joie de Vivre properties.Dear Nick,Thank you for taking the time and post a review about your stay at the Hotel Rex on Tripadvisor. I'm truly sorry that we were not able to find a room to your liking. I can assure you that it is our highest priority to train our staff so that can provide excellent service - something we obviously failed to do during your stay.We genuinely value the feedback our guests provide both when we get it right and when we fail to do so as it is extremely helpful for us to discover areas in which we need to improve our service and operations.Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.Kindest regards,Lorenz MaurerGeneral ManagerHotel Rexlmaurerjdhvotels.com415 217 4023",Bad

"My family of 5 stayed at the hotel for three nights in March. It was a good location if you are going to the ball game or hockey game. The free continental breakfast was basic and generally fine except that the juice machine was out of order and they had no alternatives. The first day there were small cans of apple juice, but the next two mornings there was nothing. Why couldn't the hotel have purchased juice and placed them in pitchers to refill or purchase more small cans of juice The breakfast items were not re-stocked regularly even though there was someone in the area working.Upon check-out we found out that our young children had ended up going to a pay channel and we were charged for a movie that they did not know they were paying for (they just click the buttons) and did not watch in in its entirety. The manager would only credit one of two charges as it was only on for something like 5 min. Upon receiving my credit card bill, the charge was never reversed. There was ZERO goodwill. They should also have warning signs about in room tv charges or upon check-in with young children, ask the customers if they would like the tv purchases locked out.The two bedroom was cramped, but we managed to survive the three nights.Thoroughly disappointed and will stick with Staybridge Suites from now on and pay the little bit extra instead of the Marriott.Thank you for reviewing us on Trip Advisor. It is unfortunate that we did not meet your expectations. Our goal is to make sure that our guests are aware of the type of amenities that we offer. Our Continental breakfast offers several items from six types of cereals, muffins, bagels English muffins, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, a waffle station, and juice. We apologize that during your time with us we had an issue that was out of our control and the preventative maintenance service on our equipment failed due to an internal part malfunction. This issue has been corrected and we now have a new juice machine which was replaced quickly after this time frame. For future guest arriving with small children you can request to have all movies turned off in your suite to avoid this issue as movies watched past a certain amount of time cannot be removed. Just ask a friendly front desk agent at your time of check in and they will be happy to adhere to this request. We did try and assist you in removing as many of the movie items as we could. Thank you again for staying with us and we would love another opportunity to improve upon your last visit. Thank you for again for staying.",Bad

"Over the years I have stayed at numerous Hamptons and been generally satisfied, but not now.We stayed at this Hampton for two nights. Somehow we got into a handicap room. The room was sparsely furnished with only one desk style chair no place to put a suitcase and hooks behind a curtain for a closet. The first issue was the heater which we set at 69 degrees. We went to bed early and at 11 PM woke up sweating to a temp of 84 degrees. Obviously the thermostat did not work. The handicap shower has a vertical slide to hold the shower head but it would not stay at the top nor would the sprayer stay vertical it would flop down. The real issue was a total lack of housekeeping when we returned on the second day. A coffee cup with an inch of coffee was still on the nightstand along with the ice bucket full of water and the bag half in the bucket. I had left it in front of the TV with the lid off so they could see it but they did not move it. In the bathroom there was a little powder on the floor from the morning which was still there, obviously they did not sweep or mop the floor. But the coup de grace was the toilet paper floating in the toilet. That was disgusting, they never touched the toilet to clean or someone used it while we were gone. Overall the hotel was noisy with trains going by during the night an you could hear voices from the lobby. The breakfast was mediocre with a small breakfast area. Look for a better place to stay then here. When I mentioned the issues to the desk clerk she took my number and said the manager would call.

"This is the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in!!! The price was good, but a little too good to be true. They charge you not only for your stay but also a resort fee and if your room is not ready by the time you get there and you'd like to leave your luggage, they also charge you for that! The pictures on the website are extremely deceiving. The outside looks nice but the closer you get you can tell just from the outside of the building that your in for a trip. The staff was not that nice, rude actually. When my boyfriend and I had gone back to the lobby, the lady told me to hold on a second so she could finish her text messaging.......The room was disgusting. Neither of us could walk around without anything on our feet. The bathroom had a ton of cracks and was also 4 different colors. The shower did not drain well at all and when you close the bathroom door, the crack was so big between the door frame and the door, I could see the other room perfectly. The only reason why we continued our stay here was because every hotel was booked around us. We weren't in the room for a half hour yet and we were both on the phone trying to find another hotel.The pool was terrible, no lighting around it what so ever at night. Another guest had to switch their room 4 times due to the air conditioners not working in any of those rooms.

"Being both a Marriott Rewards Platinum Member and Hilton HHonors Diamond for me means that I spend over 200 nights a year in hotels, it has also given me a keen insight into what makes for a perfect hotel stay. Unfortunately the Renaissance Waverly Hotel in Atlanta falls short of delivering even an acceptable hotel stay. When I arrived at the hotel there was no bellman available to assist me with luggage. There was a line at check in with only two people at the front desk. The line moved slowly but when my turn came I was greeted nicely and welcomed as a Platinum Elite. I was also grated my requested upgrade. The suite that I had was nice although the furnishings and carpet were heavily worn. The table in the room had terrible scuffs and was made worse by an attempted cover up with magic markers. The carpeting beside the windows was fraying terribly, the robe that was in the closet was pilling to such a bad extent, it should have been thrown out! I called the front desk and was told someone would be up to look at the problems but no one ever came. One afternoon I asked for the shuttle to take me to a nearby establishment but when the shuttle van driver looked up the address I was told it was zero point two 0.2 mikes further than the 3 mile radius and despite not being busy at all, my request was refused. Instead I was pointed in the direction of a cab and told I had to pay myself if I wanted to go there. All in all it just seemed the entire staff were too busy doing nothing and were simply counting the hours until they were off. On day of checkout I informed the manager on duty of all my issues and as compensation I was offered 10,000 reward points. It's now been two months and I am still waiting for those points. The Cobb Galleria area is now more popular than ever due to the opening of the new stadium, and while this hotel is definitely very close by, there are many other hotels equally close that are far better choices for anyone coming to this area.",Bad
"We had high hopes for this place and were sorely disappointed. The bathrooms are TINY which is ridiculous as there are two closets so why when the did the rehab didn't they widen the bathroom into the closet The shower is 2 feet wide and you need to stand at an angle to the sink to use it because there is no room. The toilet is wedged between the sink and shower.There is only a desk chair, no comfortable seating in the room. I had a decent street view but the window was painted shut.Despite being in the Tenderloin I like the location, easy access for the Ubers and far less touristy than Union Square, there is a great breakfast place across the street called Farm:Table.

Requested another and they were out. Finally got one . when the maid came to clean she took one of the blankets. We had to call down to correct that.. All in all it was a good trip but bad service... They need to communicate more with each other and there guess that are having problems to make there stay enjoyable and uncomplicated.Thank you for visiting the JW Marriott Atlanta for your special occasion. I am sorry we did not have the requested accommodations. I am also sorry that your blanket was slow to arrive and then once received, was removed by our housekeeping team. You can be certain I will personally speak with our housekeeping team to share your experience and to also ensure we are communicating with one another to ensure our guests are happy and comfortable. Please except my sincerest apology. I do hope you will give us the opportunity to regain your trust and confidence. Thank you again for letting me know.",Bad

"We've just returned from a one-night stay at the Lamplighter, which we chose based upon the TripAdvisor reviews and rating. For the first time, Trip Advisor has let us down. I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego!It is not great value for the money it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The lush landscaping of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad.The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient. But it does not by any stretch of the imagination deserve the inflated rating it now enjoys on TripAdvisor.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. We appreciate hearing from all of our guests. These reviews show us not only our areas of strength, but also the areas in which we can improve. TripAdvisor measures only one thing, guest satisfaction. It is not a measure of luxury or location. On TripAdvisor, an economy hotel can score very well and a luxury hotel can score poorly. It is clearly displayed on TripAdvisor that our hotel class is a 2-star (were a AAA 2-diamond property), with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. There definitely are hundreds of luxurious hotels in San Diego to choose from, but at a much higher cost and possibly a lower level of guest satisfaction. Our rating on TripAdvisor is a byproduct of our single-minded dedication to consistent service, quality, and value. We are proud of the ambiance we have created with the space we have available to us. We definitely dont have the grounds that a larger hotel might have, but we have taken great effort to fill our space with colorful plants, flowers, vines, and many lovely palm trees. Its an expense many mid-market hotels arent willing to incur. Regarding your room, it is a kitchen layout that is very popular with many guests staying for long periods as they have full size appliances and plenty of counter space. While none of them are stocked, we do provide full kitchen packs upon request. We do this to protect our guests. We have learned from experience that by keeping the kits in a sealed container, we can ensure that when a new guest arrives, the kit they receive will be clean, complete and in good condition. Im sorry this was not explained to you. Our company culture is to provide outstanding customer service, quality and value to our guests. We manage two hotels in San Diego, we are proud that both are in the top 15 on TripAdvisor. Thank you again for your review. We do appreciate the comments. Sincerely,John LyonProud Owner, Best Western Lamplighter Inn",Bad

"I was down there for the Cisco Live event in June. The reason I stayed there was because all the recommended hotels by Cisco were full, so this was my only choice.I checked in and was told the restaurant was closed for repairs, i accepted that, but when i got to my room and opened the door I had just realized my nightmare. The bathroom was filthy, the carpets were disgusting with stains and the room had the smell of Death in it. I knew someone else staying there, so I went to their room to see how it was and it was even worse!,,,,what a joke this place is. I tried to login into the wireless, it DID NOT WORK THE ENTIRE DURATION OF MY STAY. After the second night of sleeping in my clothes because of how disgusting the room was, I looked under my bed and low and behold A DEAD RAT.i jumped up, ran to the front desk and told them about it... They did not even look phased, worried or cared and without missing a beat she said all I can do is get you another room....

"We were travelling up west coast and arrived in s.f. when the nike ladies marathon was on, which we did not realise. Made it impossible to get a hotel room. Eventually we arrived at Columbus Inn which had a free room for the night.Hotel was cheaper than others we had tried on the shore but very basic. Think we paid approx 170 for the night and do not think that this really represented value for money, although there was free parking which was good as it always annoys me when US hotels have an additonal charge to use their car park.Room was ok - had the feel that the cleanliness of the hotel was not great but did not actually have any issues. This was maybe more due to the impression the hotel gives by fact that it is quite run down. Hotel is in dire need of a coat of paint!!!Was glad that we were able to get a room here as nowhere else was available but that probably says something in itself. Probably ok if all you need for a night is a bed but thought that this hotel was very overpriced even for that.Will not be staying here again.",Bad

"We checked in at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami on October 21st we were kindly picked up with a limousine service at the Airport and greeted at the hotel lobby, the front desk assistant was extremely kind and gave us a beautiful room on the 8th floor overlooking the wonderful Brickell bay. We had a lovely Junior Suite given that we made all our reservations through the American Express Platinum Travel Services and of course they have certain perks. So far our experience was really lovely, the reason why we were visiting Miami was because my girlfriend and I were celebrating her birthday and it was her present, aside I took the opportunity of meeting up with few business associates. During the early morning of Monday the 24th of October, I got up from the bed and was hoping to start our day, however as the blinds were totally closed the room was dark and I misstepped on some silky pillows that were on the floor, given that they never came to do the turndown of the room, (usually around 18hrs they remove the silky decorative pillows as well as the covers and prepare the room for sleep). As a result I fell head first broke the fall with my arm groping on the desk in front of the bed where the TV was placed. I was startled from the impact and due to the obvious noise I woke up my girlfriend. Once we turned on the lights we saw that my hand was slightly bruised from the impact and of course since I am not a light guy 110kg of weight the result was an impact against the TV screen which ended up broken. We had informed the room service, and security came to inquire and inspect and make pictures. More concretely 2 security staff and the manager on duty. The security staff asked some questions and provided me with some ice for the hand. They told us that it was a clear trip and fall and they accommodated us. The manager Mr. Hendrik Grebe on the other hand did not show any concern nor did he tried to communicate with us. Security came again minutes later to help us fill in a report and we of course did it following their advice. We were told that they will get back to us for the matter of replacing the tv and whatever else we could need for such incident. The evening of the same day we came back to our hotel room and found that the tv was not replaced nor has the room been made up. Moreover there had not been a single attempt to try to clarify the situation or see if we could need any further help. We contacted the front desk about the tv and we were told that they just dont have a replacement tv, instead I had to request to be moved to a different room. Approximately an hour later they provided us with the same kind of room on a different floor. The day after it was our departure date and I was having breakfast with some business associates at their restaurant and while I was walking my guest out of the Mandarin one of the security staff approached me and said that the manager on duty would like to have a word, which obviously created an awkward moment. Furthermore the manager on duty Mr. Kelvin Jiles came to speak to me and informed me that I was going to be charged 1.300 usd aprox for the tv, given that the manager from the day of the incident reported it as property damage. Of course I did not expect this, nothing was communicated to us, and no one ever made an effort to clarify such a situation. Obviously I had several questions of my own as to why this incident was treated in such a manner with the lack of communicating and unprofessionally of the Mr. Hendrik Grebes part.I was told by Mr. Kelvin Jiles that it would be possible to speak to Mr. Grebe later in the day and requested me to come back at 3pm. However Mr. Grebe never came out to us, instead we spoke to the head of security for the hotel. Previously we were able to read the internal written report supposedly written by Mr. Grebe where he defined the situation as I was caught by a housekeeping staff who brought our breakfast and I declined or pretended I never ordered, later in the report they said it was a mistake from room service obviously I never ordered such a breakfast, on top my girlfriend was referred to as a friend who spent the night in my room, also they insinuated that I could have been drunk, and worse was there could have been a case of domestic violence. That has been the most insulting situation I have ever found myself in not to say how ashamed I was when my girlfriend read such a report. I of course was told by every person who approached to us from the staff that they absolutely understand our disagreement, and confusion of such an absurd situation. They repeatedly told us that the charged were done on my card and kept on apologizing.We are usual costumers of the Mandarin Oriental more concretely we had just been 5 days at their hotel in NYC. We feel horrified at the treatment and lack of professional approach and we still havent been given a proper or justified answer to the events. I hope this long letter helps for any future similar occurrences.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay about Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor.

"Disappointing wouldnt begin to encompass our experience here last weekend. Perhaps it was due to the holiday weekend, but as SPG Gold members, we have never experienced service as blatantly rude as we did at this property. It was so unbelievable at times we thought we surely were the victims of an odd hidden camera show where at any point a host might pop out and say Just kidding! We just wanted to record your facial expressions while we lied to you, hung up on you, and generally treated loyal paying guests like dirt. First off, the good this hotel is in a great location if you want to be in the heart of the French Quarter. Youre in the middle of Bourbon Streets action and the hotel gives you easy access to many of the citys attractions. The staff who man the valet are friendly and awesome. The pillows are comfortable. Thats about the end of the positives. During our three night stay two couples, two rooms we experienced many negatives. In addition to just generally unkempt rooms (smelled like stale vomit when we walked in the door, showers dont drain, sticky surfaces) they were not cleaned until very late in the day. Even cleaned, dirty towels were left in the room, trash wasnt taken away, and little more done than smoothing out the duvet and tossing clean towels on the bathroom shelves. Wed been informed by Starwood that a junior suite was available and that we would have the option to upgrade on our second and third nights, however, the front desk denied having a suite available for us. We reconfirmed a suite was available with Starwood, and then were again lied to by the hotels front desk staff who told us they did not have a suite available for us. Each of these interactions were incredibly brusque and rude. Early Saturday morning, when my husband returned from an evening out with his brother, he called down to the front desk and asked if a bottle of water could be sent up to the room, as wed already used the single bottle of complimentary water provided much earlier during our stay. The front desk attendant told him no and that he could come back down to the front desk and BUY a bottle of water. He told her that in every other Starwood property weve stayed in, it hasnt been a problem to get an extra bottle of complimentary water and that hed be happy to come down to the desk to get it, but didnt want to buy one. She told him he could come down and buy a bottle of water, then hung up on him. It was raining on Sunday morning and at 8:30am we called the front desk to ask if the hotel had any umbrellas available for guests to borrow. We were told, No theyre already all out for the day. And again promptly hung up on. No alternate suggestions, no apologies. It doesnt take a genius to know there are not a lot of people staying on Bourbon Street up and roaming around at 8:30am on a Sunday morning. Fast forward to a couple of hours later when we returned to the hotel to prepare to check out and head home. We asked for a couple of trash bags to put our now soaking clothes in for the trip home. Fully expecting a No and hang up, we were shocked when they said theyd send some up. Guess we should have known better than to get our hopes up because the trash bags didnt show up until over half an hour later, as we were walking out the door, and had made due shifting our luggage around other ways and utilizing gifts bags from shopping. Couple all this with the hotel staff being generally unfriendly no returned smile or greeting when you enter the hotel, no effort to provide any degree of positive customer service or build rapport, no willingness to help ensure you actually enjoy your time at their property it was an incredibly disconcerting Starwood experience. If you just want a place to lay your head in between jaunts on Bourbon Street and service means nothing to you, this is your place. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.I am very sorry to hear of your experience during your stay with us. The comments you have noted are certainly disappointing to hear.

"While the hotel is clean and in an excellent location, you will NOT get a good night's sleep here if you have neighbors above you who need to fulfill their 10,000 daily steps in the middle of the night. Of the four nights we stayed here all four nights were full of different neighbors above us who for some reason need to walk back and forth around their room ALL NIGHT LONG, banging cabinets, doors, etc. Complaints to the house host were not helpful at all. We never got a decent night sleep here. Also, don't believe the shuttle stuff. We tried every day to get one, first being told just call 10 mins before you need one, then told you must come downstairs in person and wait, and oh by the way it would be a 40 min wait (when the shuttle only goes a 1 mile radius I do not understand). Never was able to get a shuttle the entire time we were there. The staff at the morning buffet were wonderful, friendly, but the hot food was not hot, the selection was small. And lastly, take the stairs. The elevator is S-L-O-W. We often waited more than 5 minutes. I would not stay here again, mostly because of the noise factor.Hello, Julie!Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are sorry to hear that you did not get a good nights sleep - that's the exact opposite of what we are shooting for! Noise complaints are relatively uncommon for us, and we will investigate a bit to see if anything can be done about the particular room you stayed in. I am sorry too to hear of your experience with the shuttle. I know it seems crazy, but with traffic sometimes a shuttle run for several passengers within a mile can take much longer than expected. It sounds like we could have done a much better job communicating with you though. We appreciate the feedback and will certainly use it as a training opportunity internally. Thank you again and we hope to have the chance to serve you again - with a good nights sleep!",Bad
"We stayed at La Hacienda because it was close to the SafeCo field and we had to get to a Mariner's game. We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad, with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty, there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds, as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.",Bad
"Our family stayed there for one evening in March and were not impressed. The hotel is newly renovated, however the building is quite old. You can hear people walking, talking, running. If you have kids staying above your suite, good luck on getting any sleep. While having breakfast, in the morning, the fire alarm went off, and it was very loud and went off for quite some time, possibly 10 min, we were all looking at each other, thinking what to do, while the staff was walking around casually, there was no direction, evacuation procedure, zero communication. Finally, we asked one of the servers if he knew what was happening, he explained that they will be here soon to fix it. That was it. After we checked out, my wife realized that she had left her gold bracelet on the night table. We phoned the hotel and returned only to find nothing and that the staff no e speak English. Only the cleaning staff has access to a securely card-lock controlled room. We are told basically too bad, so sad. We wrote letter and called the hotel and head office. The same response, sorry, could not find it Basically, the gold bracelet walked out of the room on its own. Very dissatisfied and unhappy. Very unresponsive management. Will not stay there, nor will we recommend it. We paid to stay at a hotel and get robbed.Dear Valued Guest,We appreciate your candid response. I apologize on behalf of Four Points by Sheraton that your stay was not as expected.Yes we are a fully renovated new hotel in Seattle, and I apologize for the fire alarm. When this happened we were instructed by the Fire Department to wait until they arrived to silence it.Regarding your gold bracelet, as we discussed earlier, we did do a thorough investigation looking for this and questioned our staff. The Housekeeper that cleaned your room is a trusted and valued employee. It is unfortunate the bracelet was missing, but were not able to locate it anywhere.I apologize for these situations again. By far, most guest experiences here are excellent and guests are pleased. If we are able to have you back please contact me so that I can personally make sure we take care of your stay.Thank you,Joe AlbertsGeneral Manager",Bad
"Changed rooms, but it didn't help. Carpet soaked with chemicals... I left door open, but it didn't help. The smell stayed. 2.floor to the right is probably the worst. It seems to be a health risk.

"This hotel was having their pool renovated without mention on their website (because they would lose bookings) and the Front Office manager on duty Christine - was one of the least professional hotel managers I've ever talked to. In short, she was rude and inconsiderate when asked questions. As Marriott Platinum members they give you a free item from their market per room to use during stay which SHE turned around and charged for on the credit card. Essentially they committed fraud and acted like they couldn't do anything to make situations right when guests are unhappy. Marriott is losing control of quality or they are becoming a very difficult brand. Either way, avoid this hotel - ESPECIALLY if you are an elite Marriott member. Christine - really doesn't belong anywhere near guests or the hospitality industry.Hello jbsdtraveler,Your Platinum status is certainly appreciated as well as your feedback.

"Good location, good size of apartment, but that it, bathroom in the living room smelled like pee with less than half a roll of toilet paper available, there was a pube in the drawer of the fridge which is hilarious because the notice of the entrance says the fridge is always cleaned prior to every visit. There is not cable, they have those antennas that try to find local channels so I spent the entire time watching PBS Kids because it was the only channel the antenna would take in. Doors are very dirty, balcony doors would not lock, furniture is beat up, bed squeaky and would sink so deep I could feel the springs,extra blanket very stinky smell like it was overused and never washed, closet door missing, hairballs in the bathroom, and everything was VERY VERY dusty. SOOO NOT what this place made it to believe it was for the price. It looked like the person who cleaned this place did not care to do their job and it was either never done, or I was given a room that had not been touched in months. Go spend the same elsewhere and get a better experience, or spend less and still get a way better experience.Dear seviemj, thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a feedback of your experience. We are deeply sorry for the inconveniences you experienced, we are checkin all of our apartments to determine which one is the one in discussion as we are already addressing the issue with the housekeeping supervisors to avoid any further issues like this one.",Bad
"Overall, stay here if you are paying 65 or less...else keep looking..definitely not worth a penny more.Stayed the weekend of Feb 13th and due to the high demand for rooms that weekend, this Rodeway Inn was charging 150/night (including taxes, etc)...a complete ripoff. I used priceline and will ensure to pick a higher category of hotels next time around, especially since 150 is insane to charge for this property no matter what supply/demand looks like. First of all, we were given a room on the side of the highway. This is completely fine if you keep the a/c on because that will drown out some of the noise. However, when we walked in the room, it smelled (stale smoke). We immediately called the front desk and asked for another room or to come and spray something. They said there are no rooms available and that they have no febreeze. You'd think that if you're doubling the hotel price for a particular weekend, you would step up service at least a bit. We received no follow up call from the manager the next day nor did the front desk staff attempt to spray anything to remove the foul odor. We next walked into the bathroom and noticed that the towel was stained with dirt. The good thing was that there were extra towels but I don't get what kind of quality control exists at the hotel if you cannot ensure clean towels. Further, the tv was horrible. They list all these channels on their guide however, they subscribe to none of them. Why false advertise to your customers.Again, the price we were charged for this hotel was obscene, especially when a real hotel was charging 20 - 30 more. I have nobody to blame but myself for booking this hotel however the review stands given the fact that I did not receive the services I paid for.",Bad
"This place wasn't as bad as some made it out to be but I won't be seeking it out for my next stay in AC and definitely would never stay here for full price. The comment made that it's a motel attached to a nice hotel about sums it up but I'll elaborate.The hallways are pretty dingy, carpets ripped in places and neon lights on each floor which I think are meant to embrace the kitschy but just wind up just casting a glow that exacerbates the horror-movie feel of the rundown place.The room itself wasn't too bad. Small, but suited our purposes. I actually think the carpet and paint were fairly new. A really old beat up dresser but a nice flat screen atop of it and the bed and pillows were very comfortable and clean. There was also a balcony which would have been a nice touch but it was flooded with dirty water while we were there. No getting around it. The bathroom was old. Broken ugly tile, some weird yellow glaze over half the floor tiles, rust on the vanity and in the tub. But there were adequate towels, everything worked, and it seemed like everything was clean which is the more important part. The water pressure was pretty okay though the water temperature did not get very hot. Somebody else complained of their room smelling like pot and we had the same experience, I think it was coming through the bathroom vent.The part that will keep me from coming back were the thin walls. Despite the comfy beds, I got basically no sleep. It was Friday night in AC, people want to have a good time, and I can't really fault the hotel for their guests so I forgive the women who decided to belt out showtunes at 3AM directly outside our door. They were pretty good, but I'm just not a theater person. The thing that drove me craziest was the elevator. After one trip on it my husband and I opted for the stairs, but some brave souls were taking it all hours of the night and every single time they landed on our floor, I woke up. PING! Somebody commented that the elevator bell was loud and I thought they were being nit-picky but it turns out this is the loudest elevator bell I've ever heard in my life. We weren't even directly across from it and it was loud enough to act as an alarm clock every time on our floor-mates came back from the casino. We had a late check-out but couldn't leave early enough to get home and get some sleep. I would say if you're taking a trip where you know you'll be out all night and won't be getting any sleep anyway, AND you can get a deal, this isn't the worst place you could drop off your stuff.",Bad

Dirty bathroom sink, dirty floors, and common hallways trash and laundry is left out by hotel room doorways for hours, even overnight. I also carry Clorox wipes, and need every one. AC did not work,called no one ever came to checked the AC sent a written list to manager. NO RESPONSE! Manager must think if they change their name, the bad reviews will stop and they can get away with disappointing more people who visit this lovely region. No hangers in closet, closet door was pulled off hinges, and we stayed in what was billed as the King Suite ( most expensive room rate) thinking we have a lovey spaces to relax in at the end of our day.

We had picked up a hotel guide along the way and the Knights Inn was the featured hotel so we thought it had to be okay. Who ever put out that guide should be sued. Thank God we were able to find another hotel the next day. The room had bed bugs and when I told the person at the desk she accused me of bringing them with me.I tried to get a hold of Varsha Patel but she never called us back.

"I will start with the major issue. This Best Western has no staff that reads of que. It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again.",Bad
"First, the place is located in a great place. And the woman who greeted me was very very helpful and nice. However, if you're on a business trip and need the ammenities that come with a well-stocked hotel, this place is not for you. I had a single room on the top floor (4th floor), I had no air-conditioning, no fan, and the window didn't create air flow in the room (when the temperature was 80 degrees outside, the room was much warmer). I'm not quite sure what the other reviews mean when they say all the rooms are huge because I had a really small room, with a twin bed that barely fit me. The WIFI was worse than the modem I used in 1997 and I barely could get anything done on my computer (I couldn't even check in for my flight on my computer). There is no television in your room. I had to share a bathroom with other people (which is fine), but it's nice to have your own, especially when you're running around to get out the door fast. One morning, I had to leave around 6 AM, and I think I actually stood naked in the shower for about 5 minutes for the water to get hot. I guess this place would be great if you just needed a base camp for your time in Boston. I was there for job interviews (and I thought I could save some money), but I actually regret it since one night, the room was so hot, I think I only had 2-3 hours of sleep.",Bad

"I initially reserved a room, on my own, at the Knights Inn Market Center in Dallas, Texas. The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call.

"We arrived to find out that the hotel was under refurbishment. We checked into a King Suite on the ground floor (115) and were staying over a weekend (saturday to monday night inclusive). I realise this is a business hotel and the weekends are quiet so it provides the opportunity to refurbish but here is a thought. This is a 2 wing hotel, one wing on each side of the pool. If I were the General Manager I would have arranged the refurb to take place in one wing and then the other thus limiting disturbance to 50 of the hotel and keeping it 100 isolated. Instead the refurb is happening on the third of three floors on both wings and banging noises can be heard throughout the entire hotel. We are frequent travellers and we always require the hotels we stay in to be quiet and 100 comfortable. My wife was ill with a stomach bug and needed to sleep. My daughter is a 20 month old toddler and needs to take sleeps throughout the day. The constant hammering from the workmen prevented this. I contacted the front desk 3 times to complain and the banging continued despite assurances it would be dealt with. I eventually walked to reception with my daughter in my arms and made my grievance known to the staff that I felt I was not being listened to. I was then contacted by staff and told I could move if I wished to another room where no noise was guaranteed. I think they fail to see the point. I don't see why guests should have to repack all their belongings and move to accomodate the disturbance. The disturbance should move or quit to accomodate the guests. It's not rocket science. It's a shame because the hotel is nice and the staff are pleasant. I am not usually easily rattled but banging noises in a hotel - NO WAY!Please allow me to extend my sincerest apologies for the noise disturbance during your stay. I can assure you that many months of careful planning have gone into our renovation and the decision to renovate by floor rather than wing was made based on a number of factors, one being guest safety. Based on the layout of our rooms and elevator location, a different plan would have required our guests to walk through a construction zone to reach their rooms. Not every stage of the renovation is affiliated with noise and the fast majority of our guests are not disturbed at all. I am truly sorry that your wife and daughter were not able to rest peacefully and hope we can make it up to you during your next visit.",Bad

"Please avoid this hotel. After Hampton Inn lost our reservation, Lilana was the rudest customer service employee I have encountered in a very long time. I frequently stay at Hampton Inn and was shocked at the treatment I received. The smallest amount of courtesy would have solved my problem without incident. I have never posted a review, but wanted everyone to be spared a similar experience.Thank you for your review. Please accept my sincere apologies for the poor level of service that you received this is not the Hampton norm as our goal is Satisfaction Guaranteed.

"I spent 3 nights in this hostel, it's grand if you just want to lay your head down for a couple of hours. But you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in your room. The place is very smelly, our rooms stank. It is in a very good location, everything you need is just around the corner. There is a free bar in the hostel, but it only lasts for about an hour so you may only get one beer and if your lucky two (small can of Budwiser). it's very very basic. You can tell the bed sheets are a good few years old. I wouldn't stay there again if i am honest.",Bad
"This hotel is in great proximity to downtown Atlanta. That being said, it still isn't worth the deal. We arrived at 3:30, with the understanding that check in was at 3. When I walked in, there's no one at the front desk and there was a sign that read Be back in 10 minutes, if you're checking out, just leave your room key. I thought that strange but hung around for a bit before I finally got tired of waiting, and my friend and I decided we would go eat and come back. So I come back and there is a gentlemen in front of me checking in and someone at the front desk this time.... so good sign. Boy did I stand in line FOREVER. I did mention that fact that I tried to check in earlier there was no one at the front desk and the clerk was incredibly dismissive and I think the fact I said anything made him want to take even longer to check me in which really ticked me off. We get to our room the air unit wasn't on so it was incredibly stuffy and smelled of mildew. The beds looked felt prison issued and one of the blankets looked like it hadn't ever been washed. I will say the bathroom was very clean and I appreciated that. There's only one elevator and you can fit about 3 people max in it that's without luggage. Oh and GA does some thing where you have to pay an extra 5 now. So whatever the website says your price is, add 5. When I checked out the next morning, the front desk girl made it abundantly clear that I was inconveniencing her by checking out and asking for a receipt. If we had planned to stay more than one night, I would have left went somewhere else immediately. The whole place was very sketchy so be mindful if you decide to stay here.",Bad

Trip with my dog and was charged a fee of 10.00 which is very expensive because I sent a special area for dogs that was dirty, the habitaccion smelled musty and the carpets and walls were filthy, the bathroom was very dirty too, and had ticks, not to mention the color that had curtains instead of white had gone grayI think do not clean those rooms long ago. breakfast they offer is terrible and of poor quality.

"This hotel was awful. My boyfriend and I were going for an anniversary weekend as we aren't 21 yet, it was hard to get a hotel in downtown Seattle. We read the bad reviews, but decided to take a chance as our options were severely limited. The room was on the first floor, opened into a parking lot and the door had at least an inch of clearance from the floor. (this was the 'king suite'!) We had to plug this gap with a towel at night to keep out the loud freeway noise and cold air. The bed was only questionably clean, and some of the lights didn't work. Our biggest problem, however, was with the shower! The water pressure was ridiculously high if you stood in the spray, the pressure was so bad that it would ricochet off your body and through the curtain, no matter how tightly you closed it. A lot of water ended up on the floor our first morning, and after we dressed we went to inform the man at the front desk. As soon as I began to politely describe the problem, he very loudly interrupted me, telling me that there have never been any complaints such as this before in my opnion, this indicates that there probably have, but that's just my intuition. He followed us to the room and looked at the bathroom, very loudly and rudely proclaiming that it was all our fault the whole time. He closed the curtain and attempted to demonstrate how the water could be kept in the shower although water was still coming out (which my boyfriend politely indicated) he refused to acknowledge that and even went so far as to accuse us of doing 'wild things' in the shower!! For the record, shampooing my hair was about as wild as I got in there, and I doubt my boyfriend was doing anything weird during his shower either. We ended up having to pay a fee to clean it up, and I will never stay there again. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!!",Bad

"My friend said he liked the charm and age of our room. Said it reminded him of a European hotel.Okay so it's 88 outside and same inside! Why two reasons One Ac is off! Two AC is clogged, and my friend mentions that it's a model from the 1970's!He had to find a way to open the front of Ac, then I took the screen and turned on the tub to wash it out. Which clogged the drain at 1st, I never knew a screen could hold so much dirt, this thing probably hadn't been cleaned for years! They need to get 2014 Acs. Other than the front lobby which was nice and cold the rest of hotel was broiling. The hall way reminded me of the place I live where its hard to breathe! Just terrible!I was thinking of giving this place a 3 but due to their low handed trickery I went with a 2 instead.The bed was hard as a board! I'm surprised I even slept. I woke up with a kink in my neck.Thankfully we did not come across anything bad that I read about...While I did see some care taken to the room, I feel the managers wishes are pie in the sky as far as improvements 2014 or 2016 etc. The bed was just horrible.Now my friend did mention something I thought was cute we got a double room with individual bathrooms, Both had big closets too. It seemed so same sex like both of these touches.The rainbow flag flew outside this hotel.My favorite thing is the tv was nice we had a 40 in Samsung. I bought a LG for my apt 2 yrs ago. Samsung actually looks a slight bit crisper or its newerLocation is what you pay for here! Although on their room key they have an ad for Domino's, walk down North Broadway and get real Chicago style pizza that was yummy from Renaldi's After Dark 2831 N Broadway StChicago, Illinois 60657 . I had the last piece of our large pie for lunch yesterday. I could only eat 3 slices it was so big, and the crust so thick.!I'm glad I gave Renaldi's pizza a try, I go to Aldi's to shop, and Aldi's had this brand Reggio's from Chicago that gave me heartburn the sauce is too rich and hot, but Renaldi's thankfully isn't anything like this. Really this was the highlight of my Chicago stop over on way back to NY. We went just before we checked in.As for this service Inn speaks of, thats kind of a joke! Let me tell you why...my friend calls on street by his parked car at 7 PM 7/21/2014 after we have eaten.At first lady can't answer his about a rate for tonight, he holds on for over 5 mins, then hangs up, calls back does it again, 3rd time they finally answer his I personally would've given up on this place after a 5 mins of non response. They need a 2nd customer service person 24/7!He asks for AARP discount and they give it to him for 40 off. So you think you're getting a good deal ....wait for it......parking....ahhhh 30 + tax to that...he states in NYC its 40 so not so bad.....anyway ..it costs 176 total for one night with tax after a 40 discount....The french toast was good, and so was the egg, it was cute how they cut up the doughnuts in half, for those watching their figure.... I thought it was nice to see my 2 milk I buy from Walmart too back home. The small danish was good and so was the choc ice frosted doughnut .There was a problem though after I ate some, I went into elevator back to our room 417.Instead I got off 3rd floor and got scared I knocked on 2 doors which I though were our side of the floor. You see they have a stupid ad for pizza on our room key but no room . My friend said they got scared cuz of the way the elevator made a jerking noise, this thing was probably never updated since the hotel began in 1910's, from what I read it was a Comfort Inn at one time, I wonder if it failed to meet standards and was dropped from the chain...Anyway my one encounter with the front desk was ok, I had to tell her his name, and got the room , went back upstairs, and gave him a hug when I saw him, this was a big traumatizing exp. To add to this I can get around Chicago without a map, and I last was in the city 20 yrs ago.I guess I just thought I wouldn't have to make a mental note of room.I don't want to write a book so I'll close by saying in a way we lucked out, cuz on Tues 7/22/2014 the Cubbies were playing a game so the hotel was sold out the rest of week!Even if it wasn't close to the perfect stay, I slept ok, and was able to survive the rest of day til my friend pushed thru to get me home at midnight!Thank you for taking the time to let me know about your stay. Please be assured I will be addressing these very valid concerns. I'm very, very sorry about your stay. Please consider staying with us again so that we can provide you with an excellent stay.

"I called the hotel from the Atlanta airport where I was stranded. They could not find my business account on the phone---even though I have a corporate account and are one of the largest companies in the world. I was too tired to keep asking the operator. I booked and then immediately---and I mean immediately called twice to cancel as I didn't understand how far away the hotel was from the airport. I called twice and my question was brushed off. Both operators were very professional, but were obviously trained how to brush off those questions and immediately ask if I wanted to book something else. I have stayed all over the world for decades and have never, ever been charged a no show for cancelling within a couple minutes of booking. Heck, I've even been refunded airline tickets when I immediately cancel. You can tell me it was your policy, but the hotel seriously lacks the desire to do the right thing. I have stayed in another Aloft before and have been a faithful SPG member for many years. I assure you that I will avoid this chain and will spread the word within my company to do the same.Dear TampaDude2, We sincerely apologize for your dissatisfying experience while booking your stay. Its our goal to provide excellent customer service to our guests throughout the entire booking process, and we are very sorry we fell short on this during your cancellation call.

"We stayed at the hotel for a week and the price was too high for whatwe received. The problem that makes me feel like not staying there again is that the room was full of ants. We founded it out because theyattached all our laundry bag, in the closet. Full of cloth waiting tobe picked up. They where very small black sticky ants, those you cannottake away with nothing. I felt horrible about this. It was discusting! I felt really ashamed and didnt whant anyone to see that repugnant scene. And the room, even though it had a beautifull bathtub in the middle of the room, separatyng sleeping area from bathing area, it was really small for the price payed. Decoration was excellent. Nice colors, very relaxing. Nice vanity staff. But the ants thing , made me feel very bad!! puaj!! Never again! I cannot forget the hundred ants all over my cloth! puajj!",Bad

"My fiance and I have a one year old daughter and wanted to have a nice night out just the two of us. I had only heard good things about the Chelsea, and the price range was very good for a Saturday night. We checked in around 10:30 pm. The first room they gave us had a leak in the bathroom, resulting in water all over the floor. The bathrooms were so outdated - like straight out of the 50's tile etc. We called maintenance and they sent us to another room. The bed was decent, but everything else was falling apart. The shower head was coming out of the wall, and when you turned the shower on water leaked all over because there were holes in the tile near the knobs. The light fixture in the room was busted in. It was just grimey and disgusting. Oh, and I can't leave out the fact that our room overlooked the lovely streets of Atlantic City where we heard EVERY car system bumping, people yelling, sirens and other loud noises all night long. Plus the fact that we heard every noise from the rooms next to us, people BANGING on doors, running and yelling down the hallway. Neither of us slept a wink, which was the whole purpose of our peaceful night out. After being up all night, finally at 5 am we proceeded to the front desk to check out. We told them that we never complain, but it was a terrible experience and I even showed them the pictures I had taken of everything that was broken and dirty in our room. Not to mention the entire building smelled like marijuana and vomit. They didn't even give us a refund, nor offered to comp anything. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN OR REFER PEOPLE HERE!

"I checked out and moved to another Best Western in town right after I checked in to this hotel. Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback.

"I'm writing this as I prepare to check out, this way the recollections are fresh.I just got back to the computer after the door opened. Fortunately I used the chain lock. Not do be negative, there were a few good things. The parking lot has a high fence, which is good since the neighborhood made me nervous. No stores nearby, a good drive willl get you to places with vagrants and loiterers outside, lexan cages to protect the cashiers.The clerk wanted to be helpful, but there was only one of her. I waited in line each of the 3 times it took to lug my bags up and down from the 5th floor because the key cards did not work. The next day when I got back from a gruelling 12 hour work day, the keys did not work again, 2 more times up and down with heavy gear. The fridge worked and was properly adjusted. Beds were comfortable.Close to Turner Field and the Georgia dome and the airport.That's it for the good. The room was dirty, not cleaned surfaces with dried spills, hair in my ice bucket. One of the 2 old, noisy, shuddering elevators gave up the ghost and trapped a guest. The Internet worked but was very slow.

"I recently stayed at the Francisco Bay Inn during a conference in San Francisco, and based upon my last minute booking, was left with few viable lodging choices at a reasonable rate. This hotel is unclean, my room, and the room of my traveling colleague, had a funky unpleasant odor that required the AC to (partially) clear out. The bathroom had cracked floor tiles, peeling wallpaper, stains on the walls, and the decor is overall is extremely outdated.The glass door of the office/reception area has been smashed, and the outlet in my bathroom burned out and destroyed my relatively new Braun electric razor. The manager let me know they tested the electrical outlets, and since voltage was apparently normal, they wouldn't do anything about my razor.The location is convenient, and the woman who checked us into our rooms was nice. Otherwise, an overpriced, terrible place to stay. The Buena Vista a block down the street is a better choice for the same general rate.",Bad

"So I booked this room before looking at the reviews. Honestly, your opinion is all going to vary upon your expectations. Almost everything that everyone wrote was true. The paper states 2 queen beds, which were actually full beds. The beds were probably the best thing in the room. The dresser drawers do continue to open, so there may also be ghost in there. It had a bathroom, the toilet ran the entire time, but it worked. The bathrooms are very outdated, but everything worked. The shower was clean and water pressure sucked per expected. Now.. one of the nastiest things is looking up and seeing vomit all over the bathroom moldings, all I wondered was how did that get there The elevator was suspect and you could possibly fear for your life until it opens. I can see myself staying there again, if the price is right. Like I said, its all on your expectations. I didn't expect much, so it turned out not that bad. Good location.

Wait staff at the bar are rude . They act like you are bothering them to ask for service. This hotel is no where worth the they charge. Also watch your bill. They tried to charge me for items that I didn't buy. The Marriott just across the street is a much better option.On behalf of the entire hotel staff we appreciate you taking the time to write a review, Thank you for the nice comments on our staff.

"After carefully reviewing places to stay, my friend and I decided on The Annex at the Chelsea. The photos looked nice and the reviews were good. Also, the amenities were good for that price point and location. We were greeted by the friendly and welcoming valet staff. We entered a nice lobby and the desk staff was pleasant. We get our keys and head all the way down the hall. It now appears that The Annex is not quite The Chelsea and should not be called The Annex at the Chelsea. From what I can see, The Annex was a small motel/hotel that was next door to The Chelsea, went out of business and The Chelsea decided to take it over. A really bad move for the Chelsea. The elevators were small and needed to be serviced, the carpet in the hall was nasty. Thanks for the dim lighting we were not able to see what the carpet really looked like. I really couldnt believe the bright neon lights on each floor. The neon lights made this place look even cheaper. We enter our room in disbelief. It felt like a prison. There were no real windows and the room had a weird smell. Not to mention, the dated furniture. We head back to the front desk to request a different room. We get a different room, not quite great but a little better. I do not recommend staying here. It is unbelievable the prices they charge for such a terrible place. This space should not be associated with The Chelsea. I recommend The Annex at the Chelsea be burned down and rebuilt.",Bad
"The Westin San Diego has no Customer service or satisfaction, at all.

"We stayed at this hotel last night while my grandfather was hospitalized because it was attatched to the Virginia Mason Hospital. The floors were so dirty that u could see the dirt sitting on top of the carpet, the mirrors were covered in dirty streaks, and the tub was full of leftover residue from recently removed no-skid strips! I have never been in a dirtier hotel room and am absolutely appalled that it is attatched to such an amazing hospital. The front counter staff was very kind and helpful but the state of the room was unbelievable. The toilet seat nearly slid off when I sat down and the wall plugs look like they're from the 1940s as we couldn't keep a single charger from falling out of the wall. It was an absolute waste of money I have spent nights in rooms that were half the price and twice as nice. Don't waste your money here - spend the night at one of the nicer hotels that are only 5 minutes down the road for less money and a better experience.Good morning. Thank you for your comments. As you can tell from previous trip advisor reviews, your stay is not the typical experience our guests enjoy. I have shared your comments with our housekeeping team - while the rooms are older, our staff works very hard to ensure rooms are thoroughly cleaned. It was a very busy weekend in Seattle and we are proud we are able to offer an affordable alternative for guests and family members seeking medical care. We hope your grandfather is feeling better.

"I stayed at The Chelsea AC (8/24/12-8/26/12) and have to say it was extremely disappointing. A group of 8 of us were there celebrating a Bachelorette Party for my sister. I work in the client service industry and have to say that the inappropriateness and rudeness of select members of the Chelsea AC staff was almost unbelievable. I was told I would be contacted by the manager of the hotel (Ms. Terry --) and lo and behold, we were unable to access any messages on our hotel phone (room 314- the button would not connect and I heard a busy signal) during our entire stay and even the front desk was unable to access them. I booked two rooms at The Chelsea in the Annex back in February via the hotel website and when we arrived, we did not receive the rooms as described: Two Queen - Pool View Balcony. I called down to Guest Services and they were able to move one of our rooms to the appropriate description, but our second one was unavailable. Then, I was sternly told that I shouldnt have booked our reservations on the hotel website, that I was paying way too much and that they wouldnt even comp a 15 parking charge for the trouble. I truly felt that Guest Services did not have any concern for our satisfaction. In fact, they made me feel bad for spending any money at the hotel period.The rooms had holes in the ceiling, missing refrigerators, mirrors. Very ghetto. After our stay, I contacted Ms. -- via email and she agreed to reimburse me for the difference in our room cost. I received a measly 78.44 back for the entire weekend after spending almost 350 per night per room. I requested that the parking charges be removed as well and never heard back or received a revised folio after multiple follow up emails to Ms. --. Hence, why I feel compelled to write this review. Beware! The regular hotel (the towers) seemed pretty nice. The Annex is an old, moldy motel with rude staff.",Bad
"I would never stay here again. The food at the basic breakfast buffet was good and the front desk was nice BUT the rooms were terrible. We were notPut in the tower but in the low rise Motel 6 type section. Bathroom was extremely small. (Door will hit your knee and you can touch the ceiling with the palm of your hand). Our rooms overlooked the pool and their was a connecting balcony along the outside of all rooms overlong pool. Did not like that feature or the bright lights kept on all balconies thru the night and the curtains poor design allowed for a lot of light tocome into the room. Sheets were too small for the bed and didn't even cover the mattress. Carpet on stairs to our floor was years past its replacement date. Walls thin. I could hear hairdryers etc in next room, kids having fun in the pool and planes from O'Hare at night. It was NOT a peaceful stay. For the cost of a Marriott stay you get a Motel 6 kinda roomDear Wendy Z,Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write to us about your most recent stay.

"This Hotel is not up to the standards my family is used to. The Front Desk staff were robotic and seemed annoyed. The Pool and spa were dirty and I got an attitude when I asked for pool towels. The evening social was a disappointment from what we have experienced from other Homewood Suites and the breakfast was lacking as well. The room was fine, a little outdated but the AC would turn on and off by itself and was really loud. One if the elevators broke down while my family was in it, luckily we were able to get out. This hotel is close to everything you want to do in the area, but i feel there may be a better choice somewhere else. We have had more than a few bad stays with the Hilton Brand lately. Not sure if I will continue being a Hilton Honors member. To top it all off, I wrote a review from the Trip Adviser link on my emailed receipt and it never got published. Not happy.",Bad
"It was fine for staying near the airport and being able to park the car. Rooms are tired. Floors creak and because it is an airport hotel, luggage wheels roll at all hours. Breakfast was okay. Location is good, near nice restaurants. Airport shuttle was timely and drivers were friendly. The entrance was nice. Just tired rooms and noises luggage... More",Bad
"We had a 5 am flight at Orlando airport, so decided to stay the night before at the Hilton garden in as it is a 5 minute drive to the airport. The hotel was perfect for that reason. We were unhappy with the quality of the room as it had not be serviced correctly. We were not an early check in. We checked in after 5 pm but our room had dried pee on the toilet and a used soap bar with hair on it in the shower. It is a simple fix for the hotel but just an awful experience when they make these mistakes to ready a room. The nightly fee for the room was 219 per night, so I have a higher expectation for the quality of the room for that price range. if it had been sub 100, the value would have offset the lack of quality controlOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to offer my sincerest apologies for the service issues in your room. There are no excuses for the issues you experienced. We have inspection procedures in place to make sure things like this don't occur and clearly we dropped the ball this time. I am working directly with our housekeeping supervisors to review and tighten current procedures to make sure that we deliver a superb stay every time. Again, I apologize, and I hope that you will stay with us again so that we can have another chance to give you the clean, comfortable accommodations that you deserve!Thank you for being our guest and taking time to share your feedback with us.All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral Manager",Bad

"Stayed 2 nights for a conference. This hotel is very close to the airport. I used Lyft to get there and it took 9 minutes in morning traffic. The CTA blue line Cumberland stop is literally in their parking lot and I used it to get back to the airport. I also took it downtown to sightsee one night- was about a 35 minute ride to be dropped off right in the heart of the city by the riverwalk and magnificent mile. I was able to check in using the app at 9:00 and by lunchtime I had a room key and could grab a quick nap. Using the app I requested a shaving kit (an option listed as available) and a refrigerator which the website lists as available upon request. I received a chat message that a fridge was on the way up to the room and would be placed in the room. I left to sightsee and returned 7 hours later with a bottle of wine and left overs expecting to have somewhere appropriate to store them. There was no fridge or shaving kit in the room. I wouldn't mind but when they offer to provide me with anything I forgot (how do you fly with a razor nowadays anyhow) and tell me that something is on its way, then I expect it to be there. If they had replied that either were unavailable it wouldn't have been a big deal. Conference services were okay. Meeting rooms were comfortable temperatures. Food wasn't great but I passed other meetings with amazing looking food so I feel like my organization just picked the cheapest option. The grilled vegetable sandwich boxed lunch I was provided was quite good. No where around in walking distance for toiletries or food. Grub Hub was limited to a Denny's, several Mexican restaurants and a subway. Pretty much forced to travel to eat or eat at the hotel restaurant which is okay but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't probably stay here unless it was required for a conference or the location being by public transportation. Thank you for your review. As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay. We apologize for the shaving kit and refrigerator issue you experienced. It has been addressed with our housekeeping team. Thank you for staying with us, and we hope to see you the next time you're in Chicago.",Bad
"We were looking for a last minute day trip for the president's day weekend and because it was last minute our top three choices were booked, so we decided on this inn. We booked a suite and the rooms were clean, had fresh towels and coffee throughout the stay the microwave and small fridge were also nice.On our 3rd night someone walked right into our room at about 2 in the morning!! OMG scared the living heck out of us informed the management in the a.m. he didn't seem too concerned, actually he seemed annoyed.Yes it is within walking distance of all the best places, but the breakfast is laughable, and I swear there are working girls/men or druggies who frequent this hotel, there is just too much foot traffic on the balcony at odd times of the night,the management is just plain rude, once you have paid your money you are out of luck and they don't care.

"The room had a disgusting smell, it was overall dirty, bed and pillows were lumpy and the price was too high for this type of room. Even the towels were rough and needed to be replaced. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area. I was very sorry I chose this hotel.",Bad
After reading that short term renting is a thing of the past I find myself with conflicting feelings. I stayed there many years ago the summer after 9-11. The place was a dive but all I did was sleep and store my stuff. I did several loads of washing in the basement and talked with several residents about the building and living in NY. It was great. Being so close to Lincoln Center and Central Park and the Subway was great. But I guess it will never happen again. Real Mixed feelings.,Bad

"The Chelsea itself is a pleasure to stay at, however, stay clear of The Annex. The Chelsea and it's owners (same as Congress Hall in Cape May) should be mortified having their name associated with this wing of the hotel. It felt like a low budget refugee motel. Upon entering our room we promptly called the front desk and had our room upgraded to the other side of The Chelsea and out of The Annex. The whole feel of the Annex was dirty, banged-up and worn out. The bathroom was something straight out of the 70's and not the boho-chic 70's. The furniture in the room was below standard and reminded me of poor garage sale finds. If The Annex underwent a huge refresher...you would have a gem on your hands.",Bad
"It looks decent from the outside but the rooms are dingy and dirty. We were on the second floor and heard EVERY step the people took above us!

"I suppose you get what you pay for. Rooms appear clean but are small. Pricing is still a bit high for what you get. Rooms are a bit noisy and you can hear others' in hallways and in adjacent rooms. The only perk is the free breakfast, which is just okay.The thing that really bothered me about this property was the shuttle service. So, they advertise they have shuttle service, but if you don't tell the front desk at least a half day ahead of time they tell you that they ain't got you down on the shuttle log and they act like they are doing you a favor to get a ride back to the airport on the top of the hour.

"Stayed here from Wednesday through Saturday February 27th till March 2nd. We had a roll away bed in the room and it had bed bugs, which means they can be anywhere in this hotel. Not getting much of an answer from the Hotel manager on this one, was supposed to call me but hasn't. Our toilet was broken and had to be plunged three times while we were there, we just gave up and used the toilet in the restaurant downstairs, which was hard to get to because the elevator was broken the entire time we were there. Not a great experience. The photo is actual if I wanted to fake one off the internet I would pick one that looked worse, actual bedbug bites from The Sheraton Four Points New Orleans on Bourbon St.We inspected every roll-away bed in our inventory and found no infestation of any kind. We also checked for substances that may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. Again we found nothing.

"We were looking for a place to stay in San Francisco for the family (3 kids) and found Royal Pacific Motor Inn on hotels.com. I compared the price at hotels.com with the price if I were to book directly at the hotel on their own web-site. The price was almost the same (156 USD + tax, total 186 USD incl. tax), but I made the booking through hotels.com because there it was clear that we could stay 5 people in the room (often there is a limit of four persons which makes it a bit difficult if you have three children). At check out time they wanted to charge me 215 USD per night incl tax, that is almost 30 USD extra per night. They refused to acknowledge that my price was given including tax. So they have charged me two times for the tax.This is a kind of discussion you don't want to end up with during a vacation so make sure you have a correct quote if staying here. Otherwise the hotel was OK.",Bad
"We stayed at La Hacienda because it was close to the SafeCo field and we had to get to a Mariner's game. We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad, with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty, there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds, as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.",Bad

"Checked in VERY LATE on a Friday night and we were assigned a smoking room with a king bed even though we did not request one. We were reassigned to a non-smoking room with two beds. Night clerk was very friendly and accommodating. Next day, we placed do not disturb sign on door as we had checked in really late. Approximately 11:00, we left room and went out to have lunch. Returned to room approximately 2:00 pm and discovered that room had not been cleaned. I called office and told them we needed our room cleaned and also informed the maid as she was in the room next door. The front desk clerk this time was very rude and told us that it was our fault since we had placed the sign on the door. When we returned to room at 10:00 pm, we found the room had not been touched. Night clerk said he could do nothing for s but did offer to bring us fresh towels. This hotel will NEVER get a single penny of my money again.

I traveled for business and this hotel rated at 3 stars with corporate booking too. I had to store my suitcase on my bed the rooms are so tiny.

"Kimpton Hotels are an amazing brand if you never have tried them I would recommend it!Hipster hotels, free wine/beer hour, great style and good experience most of the time...With that said we booked months in advance and worked with NickHotel Solamar on this being a special birthday weekend and we wanted a room with a view of the ball park as we where coming in to scout the hotel for a major event happening in Feb 2015 Petco Stadium.This was Labor Day weekend but we checked in on Sunday mid day and it was train wreckLine of people 20 deep waiting outside for valet, so it kept people from being able to get in, no bell staff helping new people coming in only people leavingWe stood there 15+ min before I had to yell to get a bell men to help No staff to open big massive doors and we had to drag in our own luggage By the time we get to front desk the agent seemed a little put off with helping out and told us our room would not be ready for a few hours then points back out side to stand in line to get luggage stored Seriously You would think in a big weekend you would have managers or assistant manager downstairs directing the chaos but didn't see anyone of authority Its now 5p and we get a call our room is finally ready so we come back in to the same person and she is still in a put off mood and never tells us about the pool, free bicycles to use, the wine/beer happy hour etcIts interesting that some younger people in the hospitality industry forget how big a part they can play in a customer experience after all most of us our on pleasure vacations at the time we come and interact.The hotel itself in beautiful deep wood tones, velvet, lot of room and open space which for downtown San Diego is rare! The room itself was very big (King special) very nice open with big windows that...wait for it...Over looked a massive construction site the website doesnt warn you about nore did the front desk etcSo be warned its a high rise coming so this build may take years do not get a room on the north. The pool was nice but not a lot of shade and it was hot that day. Great Happy Hour on Sunday/Monday holiday.Staff was hit and miss some could care less when you came and went and no interaction. Bell men never greeted or open the doors which when you have packages from shopping, a dog etc...its simply courtesy! Crystal the from desk was so nice stopping us asking how are day was, where had we gone, and always had a treat for our dog!There is a lot of places to eat in the area, lot to do, light rail is right down the street, Petco Stadium is a block away, convention center 2 blk away, Horton plaza a 20 min walk.Would we stat again..I dont think so, with Hard Rock, Omni, Hilton Bayside, even the Hyatt Grand at the other end of downtown there is just to many options for other hotel when you have bad service that didn't live up to the Kimpton Experience.Side note the management comp the room etc after that fact which was thoughtful but hoping a major retraining on hospitality going forward.Dear RollPositive Thank you for your feedback from your visit over Labor Day weekend. As previously mentioned in our prior correspondence, we agree, it was a busy weekend and we could have certainly done a better job to be prepared.

"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Bad

"Never had such bad experience before. Stayed in this hotel for 9 nights, there were so many incidents happened during my stay.First night, I requested double room when I check in, they gave me three times twin room.And I asked for a room with the view, they said I have to pay 6USD extra, which I agreed, then I found it was much more than what I have been told. Second night, I was being locked outside of my room. After changing the key card three times, they found out that it was the lock issue,they asked me to wait in the lobby till midnight, and then arranged me a room next door,which was not even cleaned thoroughly. Yuk, imagine that sleeping at a room with someone else left belongings.Third day, I was being notified that the lock of my room was fixed, so I can move back to my own room, such a relief, I was wondering what I am gonna do if I couldnt get back to my room, since all my stuffs are there. So I took a quick shower before going back to my room. Guess what I have found out when I change back to my own room The door was left unlocked and nobody was there!!! I had to quick check if anything was missing. Just when I decided to relax a bit in my room, someone came in my room without even knocking my door. He left immediately when he saw I was in the room without saying a word. I went to ask what that was for, he told me he just want to confirm if I need room service. I think that makes sense, and I answered yes, I need. but why didnt he knock first I went out for sightseeing during the day, when I get back to the room, it was exact the same as I left, nobody came to clean it. So I called them to ask why they didnt do the housekeeping since they came to my room specifically to ask if I require room service, which I answered yes, in the morning. They did send someone over to do it though after that phone call.Fourth day, since I thought they just did the cleaning the late night before, I left my room with DND sign on the door. Guess what happened My room was cleaned!!! Whats more, I was locked in the elevator for nearly ten minutes that night, and I had to call for help.Fifth day, I found my credit card has been charged by the hotel with a strange amount of money. So I called them to ask why. The person who answered the phone said they will investigate and get back to me. I was waiting and waiting, still no answer, until I get back to the hotel at the night, I had to explain myself again with what happened to another their staff. Yet, still no answer.Sixth day, they charged my credit card again, which makes me so furious, since they just did whatever they want without asking for my permission. Seventh day, after I called four times, finally, they found the reason why my credit card has been charged.Because they didnt preauthrize enough money when I checked in, so they have to do it again and again. I said why it is different amount of money then, they couldnt give me a straight answer. And when I asked why they didnt inform me first Yet, no straight answer.Eighth night, I have been charged again, but I could guess what it was for already.The check out day was the most smooth day during my entire stay. I asked them to print my bill. And I am so glad that I did.To be fair, the location of this hotel is really nice, since it is just next to the Space Needle. The breakfast is too blunt. Strong smell of the decoration for not only the lobby, also the room. But the attitude of their staff is really good. And they are actually quite helpful. So I wasnt going to write my experience until today when I saw the final invoice I was being charged around 60USD for parking fee. Ironically, I dont even have a driving license, and I have never drove a car!!! This is soooooooo ridicules. I have stayed in many hotels in variety locations around the world, never suffered as badly as in this hotel. Worst experience ever and super disappointed.Dear mgx2222,Thank you so much for choosing to stay at Hyatt Place during your recent trip to Seattle. I would like to first and foremost apologize on behalf of the hotel and entire staff for the unsatisfactory experience you encounter during your recent visit. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. I could make excuses about the newness of the hotel and the lack of experience of our staff, but that doesnt rectify your inconvenience. Its important for us to hear the feedback from our guests, as we want to improve and make the necessary changes that lead to positive experiences. We are addressing these concerns with the appropriate departments. We always want to be a part of great travel memories. Please let us know when you come back to Seattle as we would love to welcome you back!Sincerely, Sarah Junge",Bad
"The freezing pool. The broken jacuzzi. The unfriendly staff. The rattley old refrigerator in the room. The only cheapest harsh bright white lights used, no night lights. We could hear everyone above and beside us, so the construction of this place is very poor.",Bad
"First off, Id like to say that the staff here was friendly and accommodating. But thats about the only positive with my experience.You generally know what youre getting with a Residence Inn. Thats why I stay at them frequently. I had never experienced anything like this one before. Inside the hotel its dated and dirty. Outside the hotel room its run down and pure ghetto.Many hotels are close to a freeway or interstate. This one is no exception. The difference: its like right there, right outside my window. It was very difficult to sleep at night due to the traffic. Moreover, sirens seemed to be going off constantly. Ive attached a photo to show how close the freeway really is, and you can see an emergency vehicle with its lights and sirens blaring.I tried to go outside for a walk yesterday. Bad idea! Cop cars everywhere and the neighborhood didnt seem very safe. Im not sure what a Residence Inn is doing in this area, anyway. Seems like it needs to be torn down and built somewhere completely different.The inside of the room and the whole property are incredibly dated and dirty. Here are a few examples.See attached photo of a TV in the bedroom. Its so smallbasically the size of an average computer monitor. I havent seen a TV that small in a hotel room since the 80s.Another attached photo is of the pillow case. Looks like theres either blood or pizza sauce on it. Im not sure which one, and I probably dont want to know.Another attached photo shows just one area (the vent by the kitchen) and how dusty/dirty it is.These are just a few examples. Overall, Im very disappointed and would never even consider staying here again. The worst part is, I traveled with some co-workers who are staying at a Homewood Suites down the road. Im a Marriott guy so I went out of my way to stay here. Their hotel ended up being MUCH nicer.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience and our opportunity for improvement. I will address these areas with our team since these items should have been resolved prior to your arrival. I apologize for a less than expected guest experience.Our guest stay and experience is important to us so we will look at ways to improve our cleaning and inspection processes to that we do not cause disruption to our guest. Sincerely,Traci",Bad
"If you book make sure you tell them you have an anniversary to get good treatment.... We had booked 3 rooms and only one room with an anniversary received better service. And expect to be called a liar in so many words if something happens there you want an explanation for. I was in tears. Don't believe valet if they tell you no parking fee for guests on registry. I paid too much for the headache I got...I didn't deserve thatHi! I'm so sorry to hear you had a less than amazing experience staying with us.

So I've actually written good reviews about this hotel before. I first started going here 7 years ago and back then it was great.

"I'm a Marriott Platinum Elite member. I stay at Marriott hotels 100+ nights each year. I gave this hotel a try in May of 2016. It's a nice, modern hotel in a good location, with all the amenities typically found at a Springhill Suites.However.....the Air Conditioning unit couldn't cool the room. I ran it all night and it never succeeded in getting the room temp below 70 degrees.Hotels MUST allow their guests to keep the room at the temperature they desire. This means installing AC units that are powerful enough to cool the rooms to the desired temp.This Marriott failed in that regard, and thus I cannot recommend, nor do I plan to return.This is so disappointing to see, and I'm so sorry that your room wasn't up to par. My team and I would have been more than happy to fix it in the moment, but I appreciate the feedback nonetheless. I hope you can give us another shot to show you the stay you deserve.

"Well trip was booked without looking here first. Figured ok well we will go and see how it is thinking it is only to sleep and rest. Got to room and lights didnt work, patio door was a nightmare to open. to mini frig, very poor service in diner, room was almost alive with smells and dirt. We stayed from Sun to Wed. now the diner service was very bad but had 30 daily for food and was not going to let it go to waste. But the wait was long and slow. Staff seemed to be more interested in texting or smoking or anything but service. Housekeeping seemed to be doing best they could with available supplies. Seen floor cleaner sitting in hall on 1st floor for almost 24 hours. The bed itself was not to bad. Always go on trips with my own pillows as i hate the ones in hotels. Internet was worse than dial up. Truck came out of valet with dings on rear on both sides. not a good time dealing with all the small issues. next time more money to go to maybe ocean city n.j. or wildwood. not into casinos so that was not reason to go there. grrrrr what a waste...",Bad
"The room was clean and the staff was friendly. The way the rooms were set up made it easy to get turned around and lost. Because we got the managers special are breakfast was not included. I feel that happen because it was a full restaurant and not a buffet. I have stayed at other Best Western and that has never happened. I was very disappointed. Thank you for your sharing your experience. We never want anyone leaving our hotel feeling disappointed so for that, I am sorry. Regarding your question about breakfast, we offer a complimentary breakfast for those that book directly on the hotels website as well as AAA/AARP guests. We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you. If you would like add anything to your review or discuss anything further, please contact me through the hotel. I would welcome the opportunity to answer any questions you may have and hopefully win another chance to secure your loyalty! Thank you again.",Bad

"My husband and I visited Atlanta, and just finished our 5 night stay at this hotel. They overbooked, so our double was upgraded to a king suite. Score!The location was good, right off 75. There was a mall, Walgreen's and several restaurants nearby. And you can't beat free parking, wireless and breakfast - and a microwave and small fridge in the room!Unfortunately, I have to give them a lower rating for the room itself. We were a little lost at first because our room did not have a number posted. After a little walking up and down the hall at 10:30PM, we figured it out. The room had a funky smell. Not really bad, just smelled weird. It was much more humid in our room than the rest of the hotel. I think the room air conditioning unit was not working properly. Cable did not work, so we could not watch TV (Not really a bad thing, who wants to watch TV on vacation anyway So we never called to have it fixed). The bathtub faucet dripped constantly. There was lots of trash under and around the bed - paper towels shoved between under the headboard, between the wall and mattress, bits of paper and wrappers, a wooden coffee stir stick. The entire time there it was never cleaned out. Some liquid had been splashed on the headboard and dried. That was also never cleaned off. The cherry on top was I went to use one of the new wash cloths replaced by housekeeping, and found a hair stuck in it that clearly did not belong to me or my husband.FYI elevators can be a little scary - very slow to open! We never got stuck, but there were a few times I was not so sure...It was OK for the price we paid, but I wouldn't stay there again. Next time we will try another hotel in the area.",Bad

If you stay one-two days you will get probably... More",Bad
"While this place is relatively inexpensive, it isn't worth the savings! As soon as we walked in, we noticed the room smelled like urine. There was no remote for the tiny television, the towels looked worn and unclean, the mattress was as hard as a rock, there is no ventilation (no ac, no fan) in the room and there are no screens on the windows. The worst part was that we were attacked by mosquitoes all night! The tub didn't drain properly (while I was showering, I was standing in several inches of water) and the bath mat for the outside of the tub was a piece of paper! It is a shame because it is obviously a hotel that has been in SF for a long time, and could be charming if the owners took better care of it. We will never stay here again.",Bad

"I was placed in this hotel for a medical conference. The quality of the accommodation was poor, 3 star level at the most. The hotel is badly in need of a makeover and I would avoid staying there until the owners decide to do that. The swimming pool is tiny, and the photographs of it are misleading. Overall a disappointing experience. I didmt like the fact that it wasn't possible to open the windows in the room.englishmaninmidtown - It is unfortunate to read you did not enjoy your recent experience at the Westin San Diego. The hotel completed a 15 million renovation in 2014 which included our public areas, meeting space and guestrooms. We are a high rise building in a large downtown city, therefore our building windows do not open. There is an air vent at the window to allow for outside air but the windows unfortunately do not open. This feature assists with noise control as well providing our guests with a heavenly nights rest.I hope you will continue to look to Westin's when traveling as I truly believe our brand and its offerings are the best in the industry.

"The room was ok. I stayed there from Friday to Monday. We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance.

"This is the 3rd time I have been to Florida and the 1st ...and last time I will stay at the Orlando Continental!!My party was 5 adults and the room did have two double beds which was fine, but my 16 yr old son had to sleep on a rollaway camp style bed with his legs hanging off the edge!!The air con, was up the creek and was either too hot or too cold and very very noisy! Every day when we came back to the room after visiting the theme parks the walls were wet, all our clothes were wet and the beds were wet!Our view from the room window was a blank wall and therefore the room was always dark.The free breakfast in the morning was a joke, with a free for all for the toast, fighting for seating and a real cattle market. The pool was very small and you could not swing a cat in the games room (I use the term 'games' loosely) because the room is about 6ft by 4ft!).To be fair the only 'good' point with this hotel is the location. It is right on International Drive and takes about 30 seconds to get to wet n wild so you can walk there and save on parking.I ended up staying one extra night in florida, so I stayed in the Holiday Inn which is also on International Drive, about 500m up the road. What a pleasure! I thought I was in Heaven!!In conclusion, I would say, only stay here if you really really really don't mind the quality of the hotel and want a cheap hotel to rest your head at night.",Bad
"Stayed here for one night before leaving town. The room was OK. Although we had a minor plumbing issue and we were just handed the tools to fix it ourselves. Otherwise, the night was quiet and the room was fairly well kept. Just an OK stay.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar San Diego. We appreciate you bringing up your concerns with our property as well and apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused. We are happy to hear that your room was fairly well kept.

"I had two of my employees stay at the hotel form mid Sept to mid November. After coming from another hotel where there were no issues, thy began to have allergic reactions. After several thousand dollars in doctor bills we found that the room was infested with bed bugs. They moved my two employees to another room, which they had to do since they would not refund the payment, but then made them wash all their own cloths several times and made it known that the problem was not theirs but that my employees had brought them in with them. There was no compensation for the trouble or expense and the humiliation was uncalled for. So be prepared that if you stay here, that whatever goes wrong is your fault and nothing of the hotels responsibility and that you should be glad they even let you stay in their marginal hotel. I will make sure none of my employees ever stay there again. Also, tremendous noise and dust from the many construction sites around with no reduction in monthly rate due to the noise.Dear Bud PThank you for choosing us, as Weve told you before, as soon as we were notified about the situation, management were on top of the issue, and we are grateful that our pest control company was notified, checked all your luggage finding that the bed bugs were in your luggage and we were able to content and fix the situation changing you of rooms immediately. We are glad that you decided to extend your stay with us and we are able to have you as our guest for another extra month. We hope you enjoyed our complementary fruits and twice a week cleaning.",Bad

"I am writing the review at the hotel. Lets just put aside the inconvenience of the location aside at the moment. I chose to stay here inside of the south beach because I want a quiet hotel but guess what, there are plane flying over my head every ten minutes! And guess what, when I called the front desk they told me they have never heard any plane noise. I went down to talk to the manager on duty and he claimed he has never had any complaints and he has been working here for two years. They are treating me as if I made this up. I invited the manager on duty to go to my room to prove that there are planes noise every ten minutes. He heard it himself very inevitably and instead of trying to solve the problem, simply told me that there is nothing he can do about the planes. I told him that I am aware of it but is the other side of the hotel going to be better I asked. Of course he can't answer the questions since he claimed no guests have complained about the noise before...well they must all be deaf. I requested to check the rooms on the other side of the hotel. We went together and it's slightly better, the catch is its facing a main road and there is traffic. I truly dislike how they handle my complaints. Now lets get to some other technical issue. The vents of the air conditioning blows directly to the bed onto my head so I can't turn any air conditioning on. By the way they don't give you adapters, they are part of the minibar item so you need to purchase them. Not to mention that one needs to purchase wifi connection. That is the least of the problems. By the way I asked the manager on duty in light of the noise of planes on the one side and the traffic on the other side of the hotel, which is the lesser of two evils for an insomniac like me. He said it would be the side facing traffic. Oh so he finally heard the plane noise So I didn't make it up after all! Shame on this mandarin oriental. The chain should disown this property to preserve its standard. Do not stay here!Dear Ms. Yao,I am very sorry to read of the noise disturbance you encountered which has also been brought to my attention by our Front Office Manager and our Rooms Division Director, who has tried contacting you.Please understand that Mandarin Oriental, Miami was built with the highest of standards and to withstand category five hurricane force winds.We are an urban city resort, tucked away on a semi private island, away from the traffic noise of downtown and the South Beach festive scene. We have never received a report from our guests of air traffic noise since the hotel opened and if you review other Trip Advisor reports, there has not been such an incident.I would like to assist in making the remainder of your stay seamless and enjoyable and would like to speak with you. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to see what we can do to help make your stay a restful one.Kind regards,Greg NunezHotel Manager",Bad

"DISGUSTING DUMP! If this hotel is an example of the Ramada chain the health department should shut them down. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I shall never visit another Ramada hotel again. The room stinks. I am guessing the carpets have never been cleaned. The room was not cleaned. The bathroom is filthy. The tv gets 4 channels and stopped working the second day. The elevator does not work so all luggage had to be taken up to the top floor by hand. The phone does not work, the sheets are full of holes and the curtains smell. DO NOT STAY AT RAMADA HOTELS. I believe deseases cold be hatching in the rooms.

"Let me start with the positives. Its located next to the Tropicana. Now the negatives. It started with the 1920's elevator. You only need to ride it once to prefer climbing the stairs. It shimmies and sways for the whole ride. The stairwell and halls are dark. Thank goodness for the pink neon lights. The room was small but it was relatively clean. No stains on the beds or towels like other people found. They call this the social end of the hotel. First, its a motel and second, social means.. people that pay for rooms by the hour. Normally when you check out of a hotel, the desk clerk asks how your stay was... I guess they don't ask questions they don't want to answer to. If we had only paid 60 or less for the room I wouldn't be complaining. We got a living social deal and it was too much for this room. So if you can get this room for less than 60 then its worth it if for nothing else but the location. Word to the wise, take the stairs, dont bring a black light and sleep with one eye open.",Bad

"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Bad

This review is the average of the two rooms my family stayed at on this property. Our first room was terrible. The first thing you notice was the smell of the room.

"The only concern that I had was the cleaning service left our hotel room door open while we were away. When we came back, luckily nothing was missing. I would suggest using the safe the hotel provides at NO additional charge.All in all, I found that for the price the location was great. It is directly across the street from the tram entrance and main gate entrance to the two parks. The best thing I found was the Denny's restaurant located at the entrance to the hotel parking lot.",Bad

When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.,Bad
"Stayed in the 'annex' rooms. FIRST OF ALL... the elevators weren't working!! So we all had to lug our luggage up to the 4th floor!! (seriously) Walked in and it looked like an old dirty motel room that they attempted to cover up with a fresh coat of paint (that wasn't really working-chips and marks everywhere) and some cheap 'mod' furniture. When they say that the hotel is retro, it really means they were too cheap to update it from the 60s 2 star motel it must have been previously. My friends and I tried to ignore it and wanted to listen to some music and have some drinks before heading out. The ice machine wasn't working either! big surprise... okay, so what about the Ipod dock it said would be in the room None to be found... called down to the front desk and told them to get us one.. got a call back saying sorry they are all out tonight. COOL. What else The mirror that they show in the online picture above the tv/dresser wasn't there! There is only one tiny mirror in the gross bathroom. This place is really just pathetic.",Bad
"After reading the mixed reviews I wanted to give this one a try. I stayed 2 nights before moving to Park Vue. The room was a king, very small, and fixed up, but it looked fixed up. Some parts you could tell was old. It was clean and ok for the location. I paid 74.98 each night. If I had a car I would have stayed at Motel 6 instead for about 50.00 a night and it is nicer and larger than Del Sol. When I arrived I wasn't to impress with front desk. He had run my credit card already before I arrived for one night. Most run it when you arrive. I did want to use a different card, and he started to run it - then told me he had run the other. I got the slip and made sure I tore it up, so I wouldn't get double charge. The room is definitely blah, but I didn't expect lots for what I was paying. I wanted to compare it and the Park Vue. I would only go back to Del Sol for the location and only if I could for some reason not afford the Park Vue. I have seen Del Sol priced as high as 100 night on the web. That is way too much. Even the jazucci at Park Vue with great planning far in advance was only 108.00 a night and the King or double queen can be as low as 81.00.I personally think this room at Del Sol would have been good for 1 person. I couldn't imagine being closed in with kids. I won't be returning, but if you get a 50.00 price and want clean and don't mind being no breathing space go for it - the location is good, but Park Vue is also closer.If possible no matter where you stay book as early as you can. The closer it gets the higher the room goes. I already booked for next year Park Vue jacuzzi suite for 98.00 in August.Happy Planning......",Bad
"Was not able to run hot water from shower - was told by staff just to let water run for 20+ minutes and then it would be hot.

"This hotel has many good points, most notably its location. Unfortunately, it also has some aspects that didn't live-up to expectation. The parking was free, which in any downtown hotel is a good thing. Sadly, many of the cars are double-parked, which means leaving the key with reception. When we were ready to check-out, we had to wait for ten minutes for the receptionist to find the missing keys to a van that was blocking our exit. The 'free' breakfast wasn't much more than a small table containing coffee, tea bags, hot water and a few pastries (the table sitting in the hotel's lobby which had two chairs). The room was a little scruffy too. The decor was old, the fabrics were very faded and our entrance to the hotel seemed to be held together by the construction that was taking place. If you're looking for a cheap hotel in Downtown SF, this place is ok, just don't expect much.",Bad
"My wife and I were just staying at the hotel for one night and believe me when I say I didn't expect much to begin with because you get what you pay for, which is fine.I just needed an economical stay for one night - that's all.Well this one night stay turned out to be a nightmare!1) We arrived very late because our flight got delayed into San Fran. When we finally got to the hotel it was after midnight and there was one attendant working the front desk.As he was checking us in, the hotel system went down. The man spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out what to do and could not check us in at all. When he finally had everything back up, it all went down again which led to a much longer wait just to get our room. We finally got our room key well past 1am, which was after more than an hour of waiting.2) This next issue makes the first one seem like nothing.Our room was on the 3rd floor and the next morning I wanted to go move my car closer to our room. I called up the one and only elevator they have in the place and took it down to the main floor. Well just before I got to the first floor the elevator just stopped. I realized It was stuck. It is a very small and old elevator which made me feel so claustrophobic! I pressed all the buttons trying to go back up, open the door, the alarm button and what not. I even knocked on the door and screamed for help.I was in the elevator for about 10 minutes but it seemed like an hour and no one came to my assistance. Finally I kept holding the door open button and the door opened a crack and I pushed it open the rest of the way. It was on the ground floor thankfully so I was able to walk out. I had a did that just happen moment and was in total shock.What was even more shocking was that there was a sign on the first floor noting the the elevator was out of service! That's great but where was the frickin sign on the second and third floors Who was the genius that decided one sign would be enoughI got to the front desk and spoke with the man on duty and explained the situation. All he said was that he's new and he will put signs on the other floors (better late than never) and that the manager wasn't in that day so they would reach out to me.I took the manager's email address just in case. We checked in and got the hell out of there.Well it's been a week now and I haven't heard anything from management at all. In fact I emailed them a few days ago explaining why I had such a horrible situation to give them a chance to address it and I've gotten nothing back.I realize the elevator situation and the system going down might just be bad luck but it's how the staff responded that makes me upset. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever.If you decide to stay here don't expect service you'd get from an average hotel. It's far worse.",Bad

"I did not feel safe at this hotel. Their shuttle took forever to arrive at the airport, took 2 calls to find out where they were, and was so old and rickety I couldn't talk on my cell phone. The lobby night club attracts an unsavory crowd and people are lurking around everywhere. The halls are dark. The front desk is covered with graffiti and the staff couldn't answer basic questions. My room furniture was covered in vinyl upholstery with lights around the bed. Everything is painted black. The bathroom needs a total make-over. Somehow they thought I'd be fooled by a new shower curtain. I didn't even consider eating in the restaurant. If others liked this hotel, I'd question their taste and travel experience.

I do not recommend this hotel for anyone who values customer service or safety. The staff is not accommodating or friendly. There is a huge crime problem here and the management does not bat an eye. There is no security or concern for those staying here. The manager did not even attempt to contact us when our car was broken into on the property. Break-ins are a regular enough occurrence here that the Sheriff's office patrols at night regularly. If you value your vacation stay do not stay here.,Bad
"This was the second time I stayed here. The first time everything was fine. This time in room 1509, the neighbors on each side were very loud. The first night on one side I called the front desk and they eventually quieted down. The third night was horrible! We called the front desk 3 times around 11 AM and the people never quieted down. We had to play music to fall asleep. Then at 3:30 AM they were noisy again. When we called again, the new front desk person was not aware of the issue. She offered to move us, but at that point with an early departure, it wasnt worth it. They claimed they sent security, but no results. They said they would refund my room, but in the morning, when I mentioned our problem to the front desk person, she made no mention of it and I had to run to catch a plane.If you are a heavy sleeper, it is a very nice hotel. Small city-size rooms are nicely decorated. Beds are comfortable. They have a nice lobby bar with alcoves where groups can meet. Lucy, the bartender, is very nice and provided excellent service to our group the first time we stayed there. She was very friendly this time as well. From 5-6pm, they offer a free wine happy hour, so the ambiance is nice and lively. No room service, but the lobby bar offers snacks you can bring up to the room. We wanted to schedule our annual company meeting there but although they had well-appointed conference rooms, the catering restrictions were insurmountable. We had a group of 10 people, and they had the perfect room, but wouldnt offer a good value for the forced catering spend. We ended up getting a room at Riva on the Navy Pier, and had a continental breakfast and three course lunch and excellent service vs. a very skimpy offering at Allegro for the same spend. It would have been so much easier to keep it all in the same place, but just not worth it. If you have money to burn on a large expense account, it would probably be a nice place for a conference, as long as your guests are heavy sleepers.If you are traveling and are a heavy sleeper, it is a nice hotel. The thin walls were really puzzling and disappointing.",Bad

"This is by far the worst wedding vendor I've work with while planning my wedding. I'm planning my wedding in San Diego from NYC and chose Estancia as my hotel for out of town guests. BIG Mistake!!! I was initially going to hold two events here during my wedding weekend but they are being held at another hotel because of the poor service. Initially the venue was beautiful with such a luxurious pool spa. The group sales manager was responsive until the contract for the room block was signed and then it began to take a long time to return emails or phone calls. The Group event manager John never said congratulations or made me feel special. I know this property holds a lot of events but I seriously felt like a number and super unimportant. The group rate sounded like a good deal when we initially spoke. John from Estancia told me the rate was about 50 less per night than they charge in July. But my guests easily found the same room online for 50-80 per night below the contracted rate so they booked online and did not use my room block link. The room block was suppose to be a better deal for a large group. However, Estancia has a clause that if guests aren't booking rooms at the hotel the bride can be held financially responsible. My guests booked rooms at the hotel be did it not at my contracted rate since it was higher than their advertised price online. The group sales manager called me to talk about how very few of the rooms had been booked for my block. I told him that guests were booking online to get a better deal. I asked to have the online rate matched. He threatened to sue me per the contract unless guests booked under my block. Apparently it's in the contract that the Hotel Estancia's revenue goals are not met then the bride groom will be presented with a bill that if they don't pay they will immediately be sued even if the rooms are rented by other guests or if guests of the wedding make reservations outside the hotel block. How rude! I tried to get someone else or a manager of this manager but no one would help me. I called several times for a few weeks. I tried the front desk and the 800 number but kept getting this same guy John so I basically gave up and moved on with the event planning. I thought the group rate was supposed to be a discount compared to what guests can book themselves. at least that's what they told me when speaking with group sales initially. It seems like Estancia is going to meet their revenue goals for my wedding so good for them but it's really been at my expense. Several awesome friends were nice enough to cxl online reservations and move to my room block so we would meet the minimum to not get sued by the Estancia because the revenue requirements for the room block are not met. But this was really embarrassing to have to tell my wedding guests that we would be sued they didn't change their reservations to pay more per nigh!!!About a month later, I asked if we could get group transporting to the wedding venue and the group sales wrote an excruciatingly long winded email that basically said they don't do group transportation to weddings. Which is odd because when we toured the property they showed us a Mercedes Van for group transportation to events....This time I absolutely lost it with them and was really fed up. I talked to a friend who suggested that I call Bacarra. So I called the sister resort and told them what was going on and asked for help getting ahold of someone else with Estancia. Got the Hotel GM's email number and they finally agreed to use the Van to take guests to the wedding. They are still not very responsive and seem to be grudgingly polite with me. IThe sales manager of managers Brad seems to be somewhat easier to deal with and he did say congratulations which was very refreshing. However, we are still technically under the required number of rooms for our event. The Estancia agreed to allow a couple guests to be listed under our reservation even though they booked outside of our wedding block. I've asked for updated reports again to prove we are now at the contracted number of rooms but they are very unresponsive. I'm trying to document everything as they already verbally threatened me with legal action. I really hope this all works itself out and that we have a reasonable solution to all this. Initially I wanted to have my spa day before the wedding and post wedding brunch with Estancia as well as my welcome party. But due to the problems with communication I moved forward with other event spaces. You guys have a beautiful property. I wish the communication was warmer and that brides were treated with greater care kindness by your team.I have written 3 emails and made several calls to the hotels General Manager, Mairead Hennessy about this and have received no response from her. I still don't have updated reports from the hotel to prove that we are meeting The Estancia's revenue goals for our room block even though I have reached out extensively for several days. I called 7 times yesterday and sent many emails to the group sales team. My wedding date is less than 2 weeks away and this is so unbelievable.",Bad
"Was travelling down to San Francisco on business and booked two hotel rooms at the last minute - all paid and confirmed...or so we thought. We showed up in a rush between meetings and the front desk informed us that we didn't have rooms any more because the people staying in our rooms had extended their stay! Hotel was supposed to find us rooms elsewhere but we ended up scrambling to find two other rooms. Disappointed as we always like to try and find the hidden jewel but this time we certainly found something else. Guess squatters rights still exist in San Francisco!Dear Nathan M-Let me first say that I appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback following your recent experience with us. Secondly, let me apologize and say that I wish that we were able to have accomodated you and your colleague at the Hotel Abri. Not being able to honor a reservation for a guest is the least desireable and most difficult situation for the hotel as well as the guest. We had a group of rooms extend that caused us a bit of a situation. I believe that when you arrived we were in the middle of securing accomodations for you at a neighboring hotel, but I understand how disappointing this was as you had already picked the Abri and we were unable to welcome you in the way we wish we could have. I hope that when your travels return you to San Francisco, you will give us a second chance.

"I used Tripadvisor to review various properties at the Philadelphia airport before booking and the Fairfield Inn was highly rated so we booked. We were astonished to find that the reviews in no way reflect reality. I want to say first of all that the staff were professional, competent and extremely helpful, so this review in no way reflects on them. While the lobby and breakfast room were clean in appearance, the room was a completely different matter. It was shabby and filthy. The sheets and towels were clean but the furniture was sticky, the shower curtain had mold around the edges, and the chair in the room had multiple stains on the seat. The curtains and dust ruffles around the beds were very wrinkled and appeared to have been crumpled in a ball before being used. After noticing these things, I began looking more closely at other aspects of the hotel and noticed that the elevators were quite old and had not been cleaned well either. The hallway carpets appeared dirty and were rippled from stretching - they are obviously old as well and not kept up.This is the second worst hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here or in another Fairfield Inn again. When you can't even sit on the chair in the room because it is so badly stained or touch the tops of the furniture because your fingers will stick to the top, it is pretty bad.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. We take great pride in the service that we provide. Please contact me directly so that I may address your concerns immediately. Rest assured that I will go into every single room today to ensure we continue to reflect the highest cleanliness standards as this is extremely concerning to hear. We welcome all feedback in a positive manner even if it is not as favorable as we would like it to be.

"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.

"I really wanted to like this place. On the plus side the view of the creek from the second floor balcony was quite nice. However this was more than offset by my actual experience.

"This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever had the misfortune of checking into. I had come to Orlando to meet with my sister who was flying in from the UK, she and I had not seen each other in 3 years and it was to be a great vacation with each other. Checked in, and 30 minutes later checked out. This hotel had cockroaches, the room we were given was filthy, a visiting prostitute went to the room next door whilst we stood and watched. 3 attempts to gain entry to our room resulted in the handy man coming with master key. And to add insult to injury the dirt and grime was so thick it made me ill. There was one wash cloth, one hand towel, and 2 bath towels. The toilet seat was cracked, and it was supposed to have been a disabled access room. I could not enter the bathroom in my wheelchair. I have reported the hotel both to the Wyndham group, and also to hotel licensing of Orange county Orlando. This place needs condemning.",Bad
"accused of smoking in my room. only young black kids in the hotel. ima 24 year old well put together chef. needed time away with my girlfriend. Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones.

"I don't want to spend too much time reviewing this hotel. It's simply not worth it. Therefor I will only point out the things I disliked.Unprofessionel people at the reception.Room was not cleaned well. There was still stuff of earlier people in the room.Housekeeping forgot pillowcovers and towels multiple times.Pool was closed for a complete day due to some safety tiles that needed to be added to the pool side. In my opinion, this could have been done in less time.Loud radio was played in the pool area. When I addressed this, I was not taken seriously. The sliding door to the balcony has no insulation, resulting in that all outside sounds and noise would come in the room.Internet was almost non existent. Upload and download speeds were less than 0,5 Mbs.Please consider another hotel for a few dollars more.

"This has been a horrible experience. I was on vacation with my husband and son and this pretty much ruined some of it. At check-in, they had to cancel my existing reservation and start two new ones because my stay was supposed to be paid for with my points (points for 2 nights and pay for 1 night). I would have to check in again after my first two nights and get my key cards reprogrammed. A hassle, but I was willing to do it. They had already put a hold on by debit card for 415.74. They advised us that the hold would be released as per the manager and the money would be credited back. The hold was not released as promised and I had to spend at least an hour at the front desk the next morning trying to get it handled. I also had to call my bank and let the front desk person talk to them in order to get the release done. Our bank took the hold off of the card once they were given an authorization number. I woke up the next morning and found that this hotel had run my debit card for the 415.74 AGAIN. This transaction overdrafted my bank account. I am not even sure yet if the bank is going to charge me an overdraft fee for the hotel's mistake. It was a good thing that I had more money that I could transfer to that account or we would've had issues going to the theme parks or eating meals. My husband went down to the front desk again and had to go through the same hour long session trying to get the problem taken care of. BOTH days of this, we were late getting to the theme parks that our child had been looking forward to. They credited the card back via the bank again. The front desk said that the release of the funds from the day before has never been released as promised. We were assured by front desk personnel that the manager would be in later and that they would have him call us. He did not call us. My husband called the front desk around 5:00 that evening and we were told that the manager said he wouldn't be able to look into anything until the next day. We were flying out the next day. This stay has been the worst I have ever experienced. Very disappointed. We used Hilton Garden Inn because if their good reputation on our last two trips and have spent thousands of dollars staying with them over the last six weeks. We feel that the fact that none of the management had time for us is inexcusable and terrible customer service. We will not do it again.Thank you for sharing your experience about your stay with us.

"We stayed for 2 weeks in December,2014. If I reviewed this prior, I had tried to be positive but due to the lack of follow up by the management at this location, Corporate after sending a certified letter and supposedly a Regional Manager that was to contact me I no longer care to be nice about our trip.

"I have to disagree. I think the staff in the hotel lobby were not helpful or friendly at all. A young girl one of the days, didn't seem to care less to help me out with the bus schedule or any kind of help. But the shuttle boys, the bayside bar, and cafe servers in the hotel were AMAZING and helpful though!!!! Thank you to all those guys/gals!!! Ask for Steve if you need a shuttle to/from the airport!! :)Well first off we had a pretty long travel with a bunch of luggage. When we finally got to the hotel.. we got directions to our room (which was on the VERY last block of the hotel.. and 2nd floor) so anyways, we went off to find our room, well the directions we got sucked and we got a little lost, and finally we found it (keep in mind we were lugging around a baby, stroller, carseat, 3 huge luggages, backpack, diaper bag) Oh and not to forget that we had to make two trips up and down the stairs to get all our luggage in. We were sweating bullets when we finally settled in our hotel room. So after a 8 hour travel than getting to our room in tim buck two it was just a diaster!! Ruined my night for sure!! But the room was okay. The view out the balcony was better than what i thought!! A great view of the pool and the garden. And it was cool that we got to sit out on the deck. We had a room in the old building, so it was a little old unsafe feeling i had the entire stay. The beds were pretty comfortable and made nicely. The little fridge was in a cabinet under the TV, which had a little odor in it and sat on a stained shelf. I actually have never experience a Holiday inn as a motel before, but this room made me feel like i was in a motel. I would not stay here again... not unless it was for a cheaper price than what i paid.

"Trying to navigate that area of San Diego is very confusing, when it says near I am thinking on the same side not over the freeway down some other side street. I guess I was hoping for Next to Qualcomm instead. Well the room looked like I walked into a bad 70's movie, green and orange decor, very stained carpet and flying insects. The room was in need of some serious updating. They tried to make it look fancy with a bed runner. Luckily the bathroom had been updated, it was safe to take a shower.

"Everything was good until we received our bill. We confirmed our reservation on the phone before arrival at 107 a night. At check in, we were told to initial next to our room rate of 107 a night. On departure date we discover there is a charge of 125 for the second night. We asked to see the card we signed when we arrived and it certainly did have 107 next to our initials in the top right hand corner, but over to the left in small print it said 125 for second night. So, here is another scam we must all be aware of, and worse, the person at the desk just turned his head away and said sorry about that. Actually, sorry about that right back to you, because we will never stay at a Homewood Suites again with such deceptive trickery.

"This used to be my favourite hotel. From now on you're only someone that I used to love. Perhaps they underperformed so dramatically due to a perfect storm of challenging events. It is a holiday weekend, the World Cup is being played in a city full of Immigrants who are all as football (Soccer) mad as I am and to add insult to injury, a major young celebrity is in residence at the hotel. Along with the celebrity has come HORDES of young teenaged girls who have overrun the parking lot, the hotel lobby, the elevator bays AND the hotel BAR! There has been no apparent effort to restrict the access of these obviously non resident children who have been camped out here for days. Hotel guests have been forced to navigate around, over, beside and under them simply to get service. Perhaps due to the nature of the crowd, the usual calm sophistication and unhurried pace of the hotel has vanished and the edges are beginning to show serious wear. There were so many short comings on this trip and far too many opportunities to regret the bill prior to its arrival. A hotel of this purported caliber should never cause one to feel there is a value for money disparity. Your unique selling proposition should be that you are SOOOOO good, I forget how much it costs. While I still hold a particular fondness for the MO- Miami, I have had to draw several uncomplimentary parallels to the much vaunted Ritz Carlton service standards and the Regis' brand of sedateness(stuffiness depending on the POV)and I, for the first time, find the MO outclassed.

"The front of the hotel looks very nice and we were actually pleasantly surprised when we pulled in the driveway--if only our room in the back had been so nice. It looks like they invested all of the renovation money in the front of the hotel, NOT in the back, where there are quite a few rooms. Aside from the room looking dingy and feeling gross, there was a crack between the doorjam and the actual door that you could peek through into the room if you leaned up to the crack--it was wide enough that the brochures the local eateries were sliding into the door went all the way in easily! The broken mini-fridge was actually propped up with the Bible. There was no way I was going to let my kids stay in this motel, we checked out and went to the Days Inn Airport--which was 5 cheaper a night, and although it was no palace, at least we felt safe and had a clean place to stay!

"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights, arriving on Tuesday 7 October and departing Thursday 9th. I was very disappointed.My reservation for this stay was confirmed in January 2014. It was prepaid, and the charge was posted to my credit card account on 10 January last. I selected the hotel partly for its location, partly because it offered the facilities and amenities I sought, and partly because of good reviews on TripAdvisor.When we arrived at the hotel on 7 October, the lady on the front counter told me the MasterCard I presented was declined, and requested another card. Since I knew there was nothing wrong with my card or account, I stood my ground. Reluctantly she tried again, and succeeded. But that was clearly not her first choice.I told her the reservation was prepaid, which she denied. She said it would be charged to my card. After I got settled in my room I went online and downloaded a copy of my credit card statement for the month of January (showing the charge for this stay), which I showed the front desk lady. Reluctantly she agreed and asked pointedly It has not been charged to your account here, has itOne of the amenities that drove my choice of this hotel was free parking, as advertised on the hotels website. What it does not say is that there are only 40 or 41 spaces, given out on a first come first served basis. When we arrived they had all been given out. Because we were staying two nights I was permitted to park on the street in front of the hotel, rather than off-site (the other option). Neither of those options fits what I understand when a hotel advertises free parking. (I was given access to the hotel's parking area for our second night.)When we reached our room we were very disappointed at its size. There was neither room nor a stand to open two suitcases one case occupied the armchair, leaving only the desk chair for seating. This does not conform with what I expect from a Best Western, let alone a Best Western Plus hotel. And at 161 per night I consider it over-priced, though most hotels of this standard in New Orleans seem to charge around this figure.On both mornings we were at the hotel, when I stepped into the bath to shower there appeared black grime on the bath from my feet this came from the carpet. I complained the first morning and asked that the floor be vacuumed, but the problem was still there the second morning. I consider that the carpet in that room requires a shampoo.Finally, on both mornings when we came to breakfast the four tables provided were all fully used. On the first morning we had our breakfast in the Business Centre on the second morning we waited until other guests left.On the morning of our departure there appeared under the door a statement which, in the light of the initial denial that the reservation was prepaid, could have meant that the hotel had charged the stay to my credit card on the day of my arrival. The lady at the front desk on departure morning clarified that, though I must say bringing a January payment into the hotels account on 7 October seems a strange way to keep books. But the total of this statement exceeded my prepayment by 4.92, and appeared to say this amount was charged to my card on departure. I hope and expect that no attempt is made to recover this amount. A prepaid room is fully prepaid if the hotels charges change between when the stay is prepaid and when the guests arrive, that is the hotels risk. After all, they had my money for nine months. It is not a charge that can legitimately be passed on to the customer.Bruxin,I appreciate you taking time to let us know about the issues you had with the hotel. I am very sorry about the confusion with the prepayment. We just switched out front desk system, and they have been working on it for about a week and a half! The system is not playing well with out credit card swipers causing declines, so we have new ones on order. I have refunded the 4.92 to your credit card. The city implemented a tourism assessment in April causing the difference in your bill.

"When my friends and I looked for overnight stays in New Orleans during this years's Jazz festival we were in desperate need for accomodation as we decided to go on the trip last minute. When we explained the management that we needed to stay on a budget as low as possible, preferring to share one room instead of booking two, they deliberately misunderstood us, charging us the room rate for two instead of one. We immediatly realized the mistake and asked to rectify it. The management was then totally unhelpful, refused to rectify and called the police. The police sided with the management, which should not even have been an issue at all right from the start.

The showers an dtoilet on the floor, so in the morning you have to wait a while to refresh. During my tour in western States thius was the worst experience! The price FAR to high for what you get!Distance to the town is OK. The only positiv thing on this place if you feel good to walk between the homeless. Bottles, dirt etc...",Bad
"My family are Disney annual passholders so we wanted to drive up for an overnight and get an extra evening in. We decided to stay here because some of the other hotels we normally stay at were booked. I read the reviews re: the parking, so I was prepared. Also ready the reviews re: the bad coffee...nothing still prepared me for the horrible stuff they serve. No hot water for tea either.The room just had a general feel of being old and tired. My eight year old grandson panicked when he went to take a shower. He felt as if he was using towels someone else had used.What was the true kicker was when we left. My daughter-in-law left her makeup bag in the room.When we had left a different Anaheim hotel a few months before, they called immediately because I had left my sunglasses there.No one called her.She arrived home and since we arrived late, didn't notice until she was getting ready for work the next day.She called the hotel. At first they said it wasn't there, then changed their minds and said it was.When the bag arrived a few days later - 1/2 of her makeup was missing! (Naturally, the more expensive makeup.)She called the hotel and asked to speak to the manager. He wasn't available. She asked when. They said he would arrive in the late afternoon and he would call her.No call.She called back. Was told she had just missed the manager and the manager wouldn't be until Monday.She called Monday am. The manager wasn't in. She should call back.She wasn't able to talk to manager until Tuesday -- about 4 days AFTER her first call.The manager denied anything was missing. no comments such as: I'm so sorry...I'll look into it. Just a plain denial.We will never, ever stay here again.",Bad

"They literally could not pay me to stay here again.Rewind 24 hours ago...check in seems fine. The place has a musty smell and everything is extremely run down - but okay, fine, its one night. Go to an elevator behind the diner. The elevator is barely in service. There is a blinking neon sign that reminds you that this is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The walls and carpets are drab/dark and the lighting is dim.First room we go in, okay seems fine, upon further inspection a GIGANTIC hole in the wall. Called the front desk and they could not have seemed more apathetic. No, OMG we are so sorry! Instead there was okay we will change it... fine....Second room, smells like ciggarettes but okay. Another smaller hole in the wall, but everything else seems okay. We go out, come back around 1 get ready for bed and lie down. Fiance and I cannot sleep with out noise so we turned on the AC - only heat came out, so we tried to sleep without it. Think again! This is where our nightmare began - you will hear every noise in atlantic city. From a bum sneezing, to some frat kids screaming, to some bachelorettes flirting with the frat guys I think I heard it all. I ended up going in the hall way and screaming some profane things at them.Cut to 5 am..this is still occuring. In fact, one of the frat guys smashed into our door with his entire body and screamed oh S*it I finally gave in and went to the front desk and asked them if they could do something - they sent two security guards (who to their credit were very nice) but could not do much to help. NEedless to say, we checked out immediately. The manager could not do much but gave us a credit. I Will be disputing the charge on my credit card. My favorite part - as we were walking out, blood was smeared all over the wall! Guessing it was one of the idiots that decided 5 am was a good time for a hallway wrestling match.IF you are thinking about staying here - think again! It is dirty, disgusting, run down and nothing like the pictures on the website. I actually think the fact that they even have those pictures on the website has to be illegal/unethical.",Bad

I wouldve given this property a perfect score, the family and i loved our room and the location. However, I am hesitant to stay here ever again for fear the hotel will just decide to make whatever fraudulent charges to my account without my permission and for nights i did Not stay there. To top that off. This shouldve been something they credited me back asap, i shouldnt still be waiting for the money in my account days and days later, i dont appreciate how slow its taking the hotel to decide to refund me and get back to me, this made me negative in my account and accumulated bank fees. And not once has the hotel offered to compensate for the charges their mistake has made on my account and will continue to make until they put the money back into my account.",Bad
For a place just to sleep it may be ok. But there was mold in the bathroom. It is very close to the highway but very ran down part of town.

"We had booked this hotel for two nights after our cruise in January . Two months before we were to arrive our plane home was moved to an exceptionally early time. We decided we had to stay at an airport hotel in order to make our plane, since we had to be at the airport by 4:30AM. I called to cancel the one night. Imagine my surprise when Hyatt raised the room rate for the remaining night 165. I questioned the reasoning and was told that even though we had until 24 hours before to cancel they treated the remaining night as a new reservation. We found a different hotel a block away and cancelled this entire reservation. Beware!",Bad

"Stayed at the JW Marriott several times now as it is in a very convenient location and close to Houston's, however I think it is a dump the more I stay. This last time, the price increases from one amount to about a 100.00 more in 2 hours when I went back to book. Then I get a room with a shower/tub combo that I specifically said, I don't want. My morning shower was a nightmare to say the least. The water only trickled out of the faucet as the handle was off in my hand. Seriously I could not even shampoo my hair. I was livid. Pictures attached as when I say trickled I mean that may be an exaggeration as it was only basically dripping. The rooms are really a dump. Last time the air did not work and the filter looked to be about 10 years old. This room had air that worked so well it sounded like someone was in the duct work banging to get out, seriously I turned the air off to get some sleep. The decor is very modern and updated and truly looks nice. I just expect the room to be comfortable in a JW not falling apart. Very unhappy with this hotel. Moved over to the AC from now on.Thank you for your recent visit. I am sorry you were disappointed in your stay and the with housekeeping issues you described. Rest assured that I have followed up with our staff for immediate correction. I am not sure what may have happened with the rate increase you mentioned. If we were close to sold out there may not have been a general room available any longer and only our Executive floor rooms.

"A transient welfare hotel without amenities of any kind, but once a week, non-scrub housekeeping. No elevators despite 5 floors, no handicapped access, despite ADA laws. A non-responsive corporate office for this multi state, chain of single rooms rented by the week is less than 5 miles away, at Paces Ferry Rd., so there's no excuse. They don't return calls or emails.Most employees here are pleasant, but as we all know, one incompetent individual can bring down a hard earned reputation. Reservations were not recorded by the woman, and repair orders went weeks unacknowledged, including toilet overflowing issues, electrical hazards of broken sockets and short circuiting of outlets and kitchen burners. Thankfully, we rarely cooked. Good restaurants chains in the area are a plus. No air conditioning in the room or repair effort in six months. Must be owned by a billionaire I'd suppose, since rooms lay vacant and Ms. Murphy has no problem sassing the guests or playing the slumlord.Holes in the walls, the room was infested with bed and other bugs, mice. A dirtier room I had never seen before. A few hired hands, paint, steamer, laundry bug spray clean up a place well, if you need a good location, at a cheap price, which is what we did. Your own stuff, can make it comfortable for an extended stay. Security personnel, Miss Melanie and manager are excellent, polite, reputable and we never had any valuables go missing during a year using this Piedmont Circle facility.",Bad

"The hotel was under major construction - there is no front desk/lobby area. This was not apparent when booking the room. The front door was closed and there were work crews in the makeshift lobby area during our entire stay. The free breakfast is a single piece of bread and a small glass of orange juice. There is no free breakfast. The hotel is extremely overpriced. The hotel is within decent walking distance of the New Orleans sights. The customer service is non-existent. I booked this hotel through hotels.com after calling to confirm that I could use a third party site and still get a Cruise and Stay discount on cruise terminal parking. The hotel CONFIRMED that I could do this. They also CONFIRMED this when I arrived at check-in. At check out they DENIED that I could have discounted cruise parking and the front desk employee refused to contact a manager or customer service for me. Customer service did not answer my call after 30 minutes.Dear E G,I am terribly sorry to read about the service that you experienced in May of 2016. We are no longer under any construction and I can assure you that this is not typical service for our hotel- especially now. I apologize that you were misinformed about our cruise parking rate as that does need to be booked directly in order to ensure the discount. I am not sure who you are referencing in regards to customer service but there is no excuse for the experience that you had. We do offer a complimentary croissant along with your choice of coffee, a variety of teas or orange juice delivered right to your room. It is our intention for this to be a nice treat before you head out to explore our beautiful city for the day. If you find yourself in New Orleans again, I do hope you stop by to see the difference a year can make. Best,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000",Bad

"This is a review of the customer service that I experienced at the Hilton. You would certainly expect better customer service from a 4-star hotel. After booking, I immediately reviewed the information and noticed the date was incorrect. So I called them to make the necessary correction. Apparently, it routed to a different date because the preselected date was not available (that's what the agent told me). They would not give me a refund, allow me to change my date, or even a credit to be applied to future reservations (not even a partial credit!). Now I'm stuck with a reservation that I can't even use. Thus, this review will only be limited to the customer service as I won't be able to use the reservation to enjoy the room. After this experience, I'm boycotting the Hilton. It's unfortunate as I always choose the Hilton above other hotels. No longer a fan!We thank you for submitting a guest survey. It is very unfortunate that you booked a non-refundable/non-modifiable reservation online. This review, while being pointed at our hotel as the one providing poor service, highlights the drawback with booking these type of reservations online. Hilton urges guests to book reservations through our websites. While these other internet booking sites offer a significant discount, the reservations mostly are not guaranteed a specific room type (king or double) and, most importantly, the reservations are not modifiable and cannot be canceled. This is clearly stated through the website that you booked on. Please use Hilton.com to book your stay. With our reservations, we have the flexibility to assist you when reservations need to be modified.",Bad
"One night staff theaten to call police and lock the doors as one our members (coach was in the sitting area with a player). He was rude and could of spoke to the guests in a polite manner before giving the rude ultimatum as there was a loud party not from our group making noise the night before. Rooms has a old smell and I had to spray the pillows and sheets with frebreeze. Housekeeping missed cleaning our room one day as they said we refused cleaning, I asked all the guest in the room and they said this never happened. Also housekeeping was performed very late in many of our groups rooms. Perhaps more cleaning staff is needed during the busy Albion cup weekend. The internet needs faster speed, perhaps this is the way Hampton makes money if guest are frustrated with the complimentary internet.Rooms should have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds as they are very small for 4 adults. I used the coffee maker/fridge/microwave, happy they were available but they could use upgrading.The pool was cool and there was no hot tub. It would also be benificial to have laundry on site- even if we have to pay for it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to future guest on TripadvisorThank you for your review.

I asked for any room, I'm not picky. he said sure we have one for ya...then I mentioned the corporate card I travel for business on and was told, he would see if he had a room.(card is for discounted rates like AAA) I then mentioned that I had a rewards number I wished to use and he handed me back the rewards card and said that the rewards points would not be awarded on discounted rates. (I have received rewards points on EVERY hotel I checked into with this same card including BW plus, Holiday inn, comfort/quality...every one! ) he then answered the phone again and interupted our conversation without even saying excuse me or anything...and after a few minutes of being ignored I left and told them i would find another hotel that was friendlier.I went a little farther toward the jobsite and got a room at another Best Western in Santee...where they are friendly and I really liked the empolyees and the location.

"Hotel stay was ruined 1) the pool closed on the 2nd day due to child's toilet accident. Hotel staff then shocked the pool, and opened it several hours later. However, 2) no warning sign was put out to inform guests that shocked indoor pools are dangerous for people with respiratory problems. Had to end stay at Hotel early due to sudden severe respiratory problems that developed at the pool on 2nd day. My Dr. later informed me that the chemicals in the air from the shocked pool caused my respiratory problems.

"I travel on business nationwide constantly, and I'm gold level for most chains: now I know why I don't stay at Sheratons often. Their location on Bourbon Street is bad enough. It took my 1/2 to go one block due to all the drunk revelers walking in the street, and the GPS didn't know what to do. By the time I got to the front desk, I was tired to the point of tears, and the front desk staff were cold, unfriendly and rude. As it turns out the Starwood computer system messed up and showed me as arriving the next night. Despite seeing a well dressed, exhausted middle aged woman asking for help, the front desk lady just looked at me and said, loudly, You're here on the wrong night!looking at me as though I were an idiot. She made NO effort to find me room, NOR did she even offer to call another hotel to get me a room, even though it was almost midnight, for my plane had been delayed three hours!!!

"My husband and I usually stay 3 or more times a year at this hotel when we go in to Midtown to see a play at the Woodruff Arts Center Complex. The location is excellent - within easy walking distance to do this and also a couple of acceptable restaurants nearby.We went last week and on a Tuesday night, I made the reservation 2 hours prior using my Marriott Rewards Elite Member points. When we arrived we were told they were starting a refurbishment of the hotel so the water was off until about 6:30. Why not mention this when I was making the reservationSo no nice hot shower and chance to spruce up and change clothes before going out to make the theater curtain. So we decided o.k. we will go to plan B - no play we will go out to eat and then just watch a movie in the room - with no kids around- what a treat - something without talking animals! But wait - the movie channels were not working on the TV- so no movie or play! To be fair the front desk offered to send someone to try and fix the problem - but we were already in our pajamas and I just did not feel like getting redressed for a stranger to come attempt to fix the issue. We just went to sleep. The condition of our queen suite should have been embarrassing to the Marriott corporation. The easy chair in the room looked worse than a thrift store find - it would have been better to take it out of the room than leave something in that condition in the room. The ceiling/walls in the bathroom had been recently spackled/repaired which is fine - except the cleaning staff did not clean up the dust from this repair.The staff were all wonderful. The young lady at the front desk was polite and tried her best to be helpful. The women at the breakfast buffet in the morning was so friendly and went and got me a bottle of water from downstairs when I ask if there was water available (a glass of tap water would have been fine). The breakfast has good selections for a free hotel breakfast.Valet parking has gone up to 28 - ouch!I am very disappointed that because of the remodeling and the other maintenance glitches our child free romantic night on the town turned in to a less than stellar evening.

Place is not clean. There were bugs in my room. The couches and walls were dirty. Glasses in the room were dirty. They did not pick up my dirty towels or make my bed. The manager contacted me and the staff still did not do...More,Bad
"Honestly should have known better than to try a second stay. At least this time, the wifi eventually worked, but the desk clerk didn't even know that the room I was given didn't have a microwave / working refrigerator like my reservation said it would. At least there was a great fast mex restaurant within walking distance. When I returned, there were two squad cars and police at the room above me, sidestepping the dog feces in the parking lot, I got into my room took a hot shower, took note of the cigarette burns in the bathroom of the non-smoking room, and hit the clean sheets. Breakfast room was clean, food ok, big sign that said no taking food to rooms. -shrug- another hot shower and I got out of there. Won't go back.",Bad
"The hotel is well located for tourist attractions and check-in was easy. Getting maid service of any kind was next to impossible. No one would take responsibility of any kind. I called corporate and they agreed and called the hotel. Finally a general manager spoke with me and guaranteed my room would be cleaned between 9 am and 2 pm the next day when I was to attend a wedding. It didn't happen. Bathroom trash really does need to be disposed of daily. Both elevators broke during our stay and we never saw a repair person. So 6 flights of stairs every time. What was to have been a joyous occasion turned in to a very bad experience.Dear TravelingJeffry,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the Hyatt house Seattle. I am sorry that your stay did not go as planned and that your room was not serviced and the elevators were down for maintenance. I can see how this would be create a very bad experience or you while you were in town for a wedding. Also that I did not get to speak with you in person while you were staying with us. If you choose to stay with us again and I hope you do give us another opportunity then please reach out to me directly and I will ensure your stay is wonderful. Again I am sorry if we let you down this is the opposite of our purpose. Sincerely,Jonathan",Bad
"Ok.. before I start the review - Can I just say that I always stay at budget hotels and never really have any issues.The continental plaza is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!",Bad
Checked in for seven days and would have extended but one cockroach one night then two cockroaches two nights later. Clerks explanation was well this is the south and we spray once a month. I was born in the south and know full well that with enough effort you can get rid of them. No apology just talk down to... More,Bad
When I got there we had to wait on our room because it was not cleaned. Not a huge deal we were early. When they got finished I noticed the rooms were very out of date and the furniture was in bad condition as well as stained. Still not a huge deal for 60 a night didn't expect 5 star.... More,Bad
"First of all, it's a miracle that this motel is still standing and mostly functional. It's very authentic for what it was built for, which is to say cheap, one-night lodging for people driving long distance. But this place is not for everyone, at least. The rooms are spartan, in keeping with earlier times, and not very big. Our room... More",Bad
"I'll start with the good, very near Sea World and easy drive to Disney. Delicious breakfast, fun pool, and overall kind employees. But one major negative problem was cigarette smell. Our room was almost uninhabitable due to the smoke smell, it hit you in the hallway as you open the door! It was so strong everyone got a headache, so we avoided staying in the room as much as possible. Supposedly non-smoking hotel but this room didn't get the message. We told the staff and reminded them everyday (stayed three nights), and they never were able to move us to another room. And I left my number for the manager and attempted to meet with him multiple times, but he never called or was available. So they made absolutely zero amends for the situation, not even a real apology. Too bad, because this place should be a great stay, but they shouldn't claim to be smoke free and certainly could be more professional in at least calling me back when there is a problem. So I won't be staying there again and would not recommend it after my experience. Good Morning Sir,I would like to start of by apologizing sincerely about smoke smell you had to endure during the duration of your stay. Our goal is to always make sure our guest leave here satisfied, and unfortunately we failed at meeting that promise for you. We are non-smoking hotel for this very reason, I would like to talk to you more about your stay, please, if you could please give me a call here at the hotel 407-239-4540 EXT 134, I would love to talk to you about this. Once again we sincerely apologize and I look forward to hoping in redeeming myself and our brand with you Sir. Thank you Les Harris",Bad
"This Hotel does not give you a welcoming feel, the staff is not friendly the rooms smell, beds are not comfortable. I stayed in a BW in North Hollywood the same week and it had breakfast and did not smell very nice. Thank you for your review regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, we would like to apologize for not exceeding with your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and Staff for specific training purposes, as guest satisfaction and meeting their expectations are quite important to us. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!",Bad
"Parking is awful (super tight space they charge you 8/day to park). The rooms are old beds are hard, but it was clean. Front desk..basic no-nonsense. Super small eating area in the morning offered cheap donuts/muffins. Cereal/milk for kids apples/oranges is the only good thing. Coffee is ok, tho styrofoam cups are super small :( Please, paint the rooms, change the carpets and update the linens! all the (old) window a/c's leaked water on the walkways :( Only reason we stayed is, they were the only one with vacancy when we called. Next time we'll walk a little further if it means better accomodations.",Bad
"The hotel itself is fine but two times the housekeeping staff left our door open so when we came back after long days out we found the room wide open. The safe was not accessible so our passports and valuables were left unsecured. Having left the door open we would have thought they would have been in there replacing towels or making beds but neither of those things were done. We spoke with management and received an apology but we're not offered any compensation. Disappointing. Thank you for choosing Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay during Mardi Gras. I am sorry to hear that we didn't meet all of your expectations. Let me assure you that your issue will be addressed with our housekeeping staff. If you travel to New Orleans in the future, we would love to have another opportunity to meet your expectations.Thank You,Robert K. MOD",Bad
"The hotel is simply horrible, dirty, smelly and noisy beyond belief. The sheets have not been changed when we booked the room and mould and dirt were 'dripping' out of the extractor in the bathroom. Even for 100 a night it was a torture. I stayed in the area a few years ago in the Ramada hotel which is now unfortunately closed, the hotel was simply lovely. While searching for a similar hotel, Greenwich Inn appeared, I don't know what I was thinking booking it..",Bad
"If you stay here you are either desperate or have no where else to turn. This hotel is very aged in dire need of maintenance, cleaning, or needs to be condemned. As free wifi but did not work.

This motel is fantastic. Staff is very courteous and helpful. Grounds and impeccable. Rooms are so clean and comfortable. The only thing I suggest to the hotel is build a workout/exercise room.

"Clean small rooms that are adequate, however you are given ear plugs to block out the city street noises. By booking in advance we paid 3 times more than we would have. We paid over 300 dollars a night! Had to stay the 5 nights as it was prepaid and they wouldn't hear of changing or cancelling our reservation. You do the math! Never again for this hotel.",Bad
We spent the weekend Of September 17-19th. The location was great and the hotel beautiful. I was disappointed in the gentleman behind the counter who treated my family and others in our party like we weren't worthy of staying there. We were well dressed and happen to all be very educated with good jobs and I felt throughout the entire check in process that we were being treated like we didn't belong. Maybe because we paid in Cash Surely because we choose to be debt free and not used credit cards we wouldn't be looked down upon Or would we,Bad

"This is the most unprofessional extended stay property. It is very old and outdated. The associates are not well trained, and there never seems to be a manager on duty available.

"Breakfast, rooms, and all the staff except for the Front desk were great. When my family and I took a shuttle back from Disney we were dropped off 4 minutes away in the middle of the road while it was pouring and when we asked the bus driver he told us to f**k off his bus. No apology or anything. I was told by staff that I would receive some type of compensation (points, etc) however at the end of my stay I was told I will be receiving nothing. I honestly just wanted at least an apology for what my family had to go through that day and if Hilton is nice enough something else. Worst Hilton experience which is sad because my family and I always stay at a Hilton associated property because of the due care they have. Very sad by this stay and even more upset they way I was lied to and the situation was handled.We are sorry we were not able to provide you with a better quality of service. This is not typical of our hotel and staff, and we are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. Your satisfaction is very important to us and we try hard to make sure all of our guests have a great stay. Thank you for your feedback and we hope you will consider staying with us again.",Bad
"I'll start off by letting you all know that when travelling in the UK we usually stay in cheap hotels (Travelodge, Premier Inn etc) but this hotel is the pits. It wasn't all bad, so there are some small Pros. Pros:20 mins walk to UniversalOver the road from Wet n WildVery cheapWalgreens just over the road, as is a KFCDairy Queen around the corner for yummy foodComfy beds (really comfy)Free WiFi in lobbyCons:Not particularly helpful staffNoise constantly all through the night from iFLYTheft - we stayed in two rooms and something went missing from both of them (staff didn't seem to care, we got one item back from a cleaner after bringing the Police in)Decor - paint and plaster peeling from wallsCleanliness - floors and bathroom wasn't cleaned every day (although fresh towels were available every day and beds were made daily)Noisy hotel - constant noise from other guestsSummary:So in summary, the thefts from maids is enough for me to recommend you don't stay here (we even know the maid was still kept on even after admitting taking the item!!!!).Its in a good location but other better hotels are also in this area, so book those first.",Bad
"Upon arrival the lady acted like it was an inconvenience to get up from the desk in the back and wait on my at the counter. She laid the keys on the counter while working and I noticed it said 222. I asked if that was second floor and she said yes. I told her I had requested a first floor when making the reservation two weeks earlier and she stated they didn't have any rooms on ground floor available very matter of fact. She continues with check in, never mentioned breakfast like they always have in the past. We unload and walk the small hike to the room. At 3:10 a.m. my husband jumps and startles me awake to find a rather large roach crawling on his face.He slaps the roach to the floor and chases it and gets rid of it. He calls the front desk to let them know what has happened and the man that answers the phone stated he would have maintenance take care of it the following morning. We then stay awake the rest of the night until time to leave for the hospital. He couldn't sleep thinking another roach was around there. I checked out the next morning and asked for the number to the corporate office and they never asked what was wrong, just told me they were owned by choice hotels. We have stayed at this hotel many times when it was Holiday Inn Express through my husbands illness we were in Atlanta a good bit off and on and never had a complaint but this was a very miserable night and we don't plan to stay at this hotel again. They could have at least acted like they cared about what was going on. This stay was on 7-17-2012.",Bad

"You get what you pay for, but don't expect an AARP discount. Found and booked this location through the membership website but was told on arrival that they don't honor AARP, even though the AARP discount sticker is located on the lobby door, and, You already received our discounted rate. Location is okay and within walking distance of downtown, but don't do this alone at night. Found hairs of different types and texture in the bed and bath tub and, when issue taken to reception, was treated very rudely by clerk. Replacement sheets were also riddled with hair, which made for a very uncomfortable night's rest. No microwave, coffee pot, refrigerator, etc. in third-floor room, and no vending machine on the floor. Ice machine made horrible racket all night. Only coffee available is located in the lobby and comes in a two-swallow-sized cup. If you're looking for cheap rates, be aware of what you'll get here. Otherwise, go elsewhere and either rent a car or use car service. Like me, I'm sure you work too hard for your money to receive this type of treatment. Would not recommend if they paid me.",Bad

"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Bad
"Not recommended. Pulled in here after a lovely drive up from LA. We were all in great spirits until we were checked in. Without going into too much detail the girl at reception was short, rude and unhelpful. After going into our smelly rooms I literally walked back out, cancelled our booking via a website booking dot com (burning 400 for that nights accommodation), loaded up the car and drove around at 6-7pm at night on a Friday - till I found another place for our 3 night visit, which was walking distance to Fishermans Wharf. The other place was actually pretty average but got a great deal and recouped the 400 on room rates, way closer to the Wharf/Lombard/Girardelli's area.

The walls are paper thin and we were awake every night by people walking in the room above. If you want quiet choose a room on the 3rd floor and away from the pool. The complimentary breakfast is just ok also. I love my breakfast and this was not that good at all. Eggs and sausages were not edible. At least there was cereal and milk. The location is good as there are several big shopping malls around. The zoo and sea world are close also. Ralph's grocery store is also not far. You do need a car in san diego though.,Bad

"I used Tripadvisor to review various properties at the Philadelphia airport before booking and the Fairfield Inn was highly rated so we booked. We were astonished to find that the reviews in no way reflect reality. I want to say first of all that the staff were professional, competent and extremely helpful, so this review in no way reflects on them. While the lobby and breakfast room were clean in appearance, the room was a completely different matter. It was shabby and filthy. The sheets and towels were clean but the furniture was sticky, the shower curtain had mold around the edges, and the chair in the room had multiple stains on the seat. The curtains and dust ruffles around the beds were very wrinkled and appeared to have been crumpled in a ball before being used. After noticing these things, I began looking more closely at other aspects of the hotel and noticed that the elevators were quite old and had not been cleaned well either. The hallway carpets appeared dirty and were rippled from stretching - they are obviously old as well and not kept up.This is the second worst hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here or in another Fairfield Inn again. When you can't even sit on the chair in the room because it is so badly stained or touch the tops of the furniture because your fingers will stick to the top, it is pretty bad.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. We take great pride in the service that we provide. Please contact me directly so that I may address your concerns immediately.

"The most miserable dump I've ever had the misfortune to step into in my entire life. Let me tell you why. Spoiler: It ends with this being a mold dump. The paint on the door is peeling. Door opens and we're slammed with a wave of moldy smell that's mean as hell and thick as grass. We're dead tired and we assume that maybe we just need to run the AC or maybe we just need to leave the door open for a bit. (The door needs to be shoved closed by the way.) The light in the bathroom buzzes like a chain saw and a quick shower ends with stained towels. Or maybe they were just dirty. Early wake up the next day and we come back to the same rancid smell. I investigate and realize there is clear water damage everywhere!!! Bu the door, in the bathroom, all over the ceiling. Thrown in damaged furniture and a sink that's falling apart and you really have an A+ dump. All this on top of a real health hazard. We checked out and went somewhere else at like 11 PM.",Bad
"I have been a Hilton Honors member since the inception of the program. Arrived at the hotel with family, and a man checked us in for a room, confirming the reservation (had conf. ). Then Veronica Bonilla, asst. GM, came to the desk and said my reservation was cancelled per my bank. When I questioned that, she became unpleasant. She stated the hotel had called me 3 times (no record of calls on my cell phone). I called my bank, it seems the hotel had imputed my expiration date incorrectly. I had confirmation for a suite but was given a different class of room with a slight decrease of cost (12.38). However, we waited for over an hour (with a toddler) for another room, even though my original room (suite) was still available.The next morning we went for breakfast about 9:50 am but part of the food was already taken away. Earlier than the 10 am noted time. We had to eat out at a restaurant. I have traveled to many Hilton's for business and pleasure and this by far had the worst customer service, especially follow-up by a manager (with attitude) and untruths that I had been called. I was also told that the GM would call me on Monday, again no call. If you are in the Seaworld vicinity, stay at another property. With our annual passes, I know I will next time. Additionally, when I was at the desk, another customer was also complaining about misinformation they had received by a clerk about the shuttle. When I checked out, the clerk gave me my receipt and then said, oh did I give you the wrong persons receipt. After I showed it to her, she said, no, that is yours!",Bad
"I have seen this before in other hotel brands but shocked that the JW Marriott has resorted to HVAC manipulation to save a buck. You know where you turn the thermostat to 65 at night and the air blows at 70 (if you're lucky). Actually in our case it was turned down to 60 because we overrode the thermostat and called maintenance when this didn't work and the air still couldn't have been any cooler than 70. The thing about it is that the air was working because the room would cool off in the daytime. Apparently they're overriding the air temp from a master switch and putting a cap on how cool it will be at night. I'm sure this is to conserve electricity but why can't they do this in the daytime when people aren't in their rooms or trying to sleep instead of at night when people actually care about the temperature! Just be aware if you like your room temp below 70 you probably won't be happy here.Dear WullaB86,Thank you for choosing us for your visit. Our team strives to ensure an enriching experience for each guest, and we regret letting you down. It is disheartening to read that we fell short of our standards and we hope you will accept our apologies for the issues you encountered with the temperature of your room.

The Hotel seems to have some really nice staff. The people staying in the hotel are a mix of sketchy to good people. The rooms need maintenance and repainted. the TV quality was poor. There was only one ice machine. There is no Breakfast. Pool area was okay. The picture in our room looked like it was on its last leg. Did not see any bugs. Bed was Comfortable.,Bad
"We stayed here on October 9-12 and the entire weekend the ice machines and soda machine on our floor was out of order. I did not check the other floors' soda machines.

I would like to apologize for the ice machine on your floor not working, we are working on making sure this doesn't happen again. Sorry for this inconvinence .

"There were no restaurants in the hotel open on Saturday night. I had to go to the Gift Shop to eat chips, candy, for supper. I had no car. You should have a shuttle service to Love Field for pickup.

"I went to stay at this hotel and ordered a jacuzzi suite which is suppose to be one of the nicest of their rooms. I go in the rook is huge. It looks nice but as the day goes on I kill at least 8 stink bugs, the bugs that emit a disgusting smell when killed. I use the jacuzzi tub and one of the jets do not work some of the towles have this yellow residue on it and the tub wasnt completely clean. I check out today to find out they charged me 150 dollars because I left some tobacco in the trash which they institute as smoking. I make my own cigarettes so sometimes I do not use all of the tobacco but if I wouldve known I would be charged 150 dollars for leaving tobacco around I would have never went to this hotel. I did not smoke in the room at all and i know it smells nothing like smoke so I do not understand what constitutes the charge of 150 dollars. The general manager was not there so I have to wait until Monday.Our entire hotel is non-smoking. We do charge one hundred and fifty dollars when a guest smokes in the room. We did have several smoking area around the hotel so our guest can smoke outside.Willis Blake DOS",Bad

The room could have used more storage/drawers for clothing and personal items. Front desk staff was pretty bad. They didn't seem particularly willing help me when asked. My parents stayed a few days later and had terrible customer service from a front desk employee, so that has further detracted from my opinion of the hotel. I would not stay here again.I'm very sorry to hear about your disappointment with our service, Christina.

"Room needed some work, or a deep cleaning. It smelled like someone tried to cover a moldy smell with air freshener that smelled like cologne. Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dirty on one of the beds, as if someone had walked across it with shoes on. The room had a mini fridge but it was turned down to 1 so I had to turn it on to store my food items. I was given room 115, which unfortunately for me was right near the breakfast area so as soon as breakfast was available I was woken up by everyone walking by and holding loud conversations. Then at 7:45am, what I can only assume was a dance troop staying there, started practicing their routines in the middle of the parking lot while blasting their music and yelling. At 9am when I went to check out they were still going strong and oblivious to anyone trying to navigate the lot. When I was trying to back up, one of them walked up behind my vehicle and I had to ask them to move. Then after pulling out of my spot and attempting to leave, a few of them almost walked right in front of me because they were not paying attention. I find it extremely RUDE that they assumed everyone would be wide awake and want to listen to this. I also find it RUDE that the hotel manager did not go out there and ask them to stop because it may be disturbing other guests.

"Honestly, it's probably isolated with a particular staff member but I am shocked. Front desk is typically your go to person for everything you need but during my stay this is an exception. It's so ridiculous I feel odd even writing this. I ordered a pizza which has nothing to do with the hotel but after an hour and a half I call the pizza place and they say it was left at the front desk because the hotel couldn't reach me. I called the front desk and he stated he tried to call the cell and the room and talked to someone(not me) that said they didn't want the pizza. I told him we were waiting for the pizza and of course we would of answered any call to the room. His response was are you calling me a liar. I called your room and you didn't answer!! I've never dealt with any front desk staff at any hotel I've ever stayed at that was so blatantly obtuse, defensive, and mean. Maybe he was having a bad day but it's borderline childish. He told me the pizza is here come and get it. I did and it was ice cold just sitting there and he was super rude during the exchange. Horrible service.The hotel itself is nice and check in was good. Rooms are clean and overall I would be satisfied if it wasn't for this particular staff member.

At this one we reserved a kid's suite, however, they do not seem to have a room as pictured on the website w/kid's bunkbed. So you buy a room and get another one that is dirty and smells bad.

"I spent two nights here on what was a VERY busy weekend, due, I imagine, to any number of colleges ending their spring semesters. The hotel was jammed with visitors and because I arrived late in the day, I got what must have been the last room, even though I had had a reservation for several weeks. I was put in a handicap-access room on the first floor, which was spacious and seemed quiet due to its location at the end of the hall. However, at 7:45 am the construction crew started working in the room directly over my head and I was awakened by the sound of someone scraping the floor above my bed. So much for sleeping in for a late work day ahead...I complained by phone to the front desk and they apologized and promised to move me for the second night of my stay. Two hours later I checked in at the desk to see if I could move before I had to leave for work, but was told that the hotel was again booked solid and they would see what could be done. At that point, I got angry and mentioned that I had requested the change hours before, I am a Hilton Honors member, and anything else that I could think of that would persuade the agent to make the change. She did point out that the renovation work was posted on their website, and there was a printed apology in the lobby, neither of which made me any less sleepy...She finally found a room on the third floor, which was above the floor being worked on, and I moved. It was a nicer room. HOWEVER, bright and early the next morning (Sunday) the sounds of a power nailer wafted up through the vent in the bathroom. Luckily, I had to be at work early that day anyway, so I was already up. If you are booked here, try to get as far from any renovation construction as possible. Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are very sorry that you werent happy with your guestroom during your recent trip.

"The good -- the hotel was nice, relatively new and had an indoor drop off lane, so getting in during inclement weather would be easy. The room was normal sized for this type of hotel, but typical HGI spartan, no in room safe, just basic furnishing. The ceilings were high, which gave the room a roomier feel for the size. The bad - we had a power outage for a few hours during the night, the whole neighborhood, not HGI's fault, but there are no emergency lights in the room, so if you didn't have phone or flashlight nearby, it was very dark (room darkening shades work well). The front door of the hotel is locked 24/7, making me wonder about the neighborhood. Our keys were either improperly programmed or were deprogrammed somehow and it took 2 trips to get them reprogrammed, the first one didn't work, and of course it happened when friends were waiting for us. The housekeeping staff tried to barge in our room at 8 a.m., check out was at noon and after getting up for an hour for the power outage, we were trying to sleep in. Then they went to the next room and banged the vacuum against the wall and adjoining room door waking us again. When I brought these issues with the desk on checkout, I was offered a bottle of water for my trouble, a less than satisfactory response. If the customer service was a bit better, it might have increased the rating.Hi Tom. Thank you very much for your feedback.

"I'm a frequent traveler, mostly for business, and stay with Hilton-brand hotels about 90 of the time. I needed a local hotel near a facility I was spending a lot of time at recently, so I chose this Hampton.The rate was nothing to write home about...high for a Hampton in most places (165/night) but it was convenient to where I needed to be.Where do I start The rooms are old and worn...bed quality was fair, at best, with no choice of pillows except for feather-stuffed (I really need something with more support.) The hotel Wi-Fi is probably the WORST I've experienced at any hotel anywhere in the US...constantly dropping signal...poor strength...just really frustrating!And then, to top everything off, my schedule changed and I was able to depart a day early, but because (despite my HHonors status) I checked out at 11 minutes past 3PM...I had to pay for the entire next night. Now, I would have been fine with a late-checkout fee...no problem...but an entire night's cost---just ridiculous and something I have NEVER had happen at any other Hilton-branded hotel anywhere.Just bad all the way around! Very disappointing to say the least!Dear Mike C,Thank you for staying with us and letting us hear your comments concerning your recent stay with us. We are excited to announce that our hotel will be going under renovations in 2016. Our company is constantly adding upgrades and improvements to our hotel to ensure that we stay competitive in our market. Our hotel is currently in the process to complete new installation of the internet service running new wiring throughout the hotel for the new service that will take place in February. We apologize for the inconvenience with the interruption of service during your stay with us. We know that not having a good internet connection is very frustrating and apologize for the inconvenience. Mr. C, In regard for your checking our late on your last day with us I have taken off your charges for the one night. We appreciate your loyalty to our hotel and the Hampton Brand. We hope that when your travels bring you back to the area that you will choose to stay with us again. Sincerely,Patricia Kilgore",Bad

The pictures from the Chelsea hotel website are not bad (DONT GET FOOLED!) and hence I booked it for 15 of my friends. On arrival we were told we are not in the main tower but the side building the Annex (Annex - the hotel website does not have pictures from the Annex, how could they!). The walk from the lobby to the Annex was pretty shady, the elevator looked like the freight elevator, the hallway from the elevator to the room had used furniture and appliances lying on the floor, on arriving in the room the decor was piecemeal together (nothing matched), the room had stains all over the carpet, on taking the shower (I was hammered by the time I got in the shower - still wondering why did I go to the shower) there was slim in the bath tub.

The next night we chose to pay for the valet service at 35.00 a night. because once we did more driving around we realized it was a very bad neighbourhood, not child friendly or even adult friendly for that matter .

"My fianc and I decided to have a last minute moment of relaxation over the weekend (June 25,2016) before our upcoming July 9th wedding so we decided to hit the beach and stay for an evening. I will say the woman who helped me book over the phone was lovely and the front desk person was also wonderful. We walked into our room at The Annex on the third floor and I walked out after just 15 minutes. The front desk was called and we unfortunately could not switch rooms or hotels so we decided to just check out and leave. The room felt grimy it was scorching hot, cigarette burns on the floor, dirty ceiling and my city view was a garage. It did not smell clean or pleasant. I was so disappointed. The front desk person was VERY apologetic and said he would try to get me a full refund. I saw that this hotel was under the Cape Resorts Group and that is so sad because I have had wonderful experiences at the Virginia Hotel and Congress Hall. This was just a bad experience and waste of money that I may never be refunded, which is awful especially when its just 2 weeks before my wedding and we tried to spend our money as wisely as possible.

"Our family of five (myself, my wife, and our three daughters) had booked a room as part of a block of guests for my wife's cousin's wedding on Saturday, onsite at the St. Regis hotel scheduled for 6:00 pm. I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic, they tried to offer a handicap accessible room, which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart, tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding, now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room, but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job, when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice, or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us, they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case, I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review, because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize on behalf of our entire staff for the extended delay upon arrival to your room and the multiple inconveniences that were caused to you and your family. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may further discuss the details of your stay, and how we may improve this unfortunate experience.

"On entry, the lobby was quite tired: old carpet, paint chipping, etc. Hallways and room had a old, dusty odor, but the window did open, so we could get fresh air. Everything in the bedroom was old (not quite historic), with rusty fixtures in the bathtub. We were on the fourth floor, so it took a long time on our first morning to get steady hot water, and then later that afternoon - no hot water at all. There is no excuse for a lack of hot water at a hotel in the Second City.The price should have given me a clue. I read the reviews here before booking and lent more credence to those that saw it as 'quaint', but in reality it's just bad. I need to be renovated top to bottom.Staff were nice enough, and maybe in the 'home country' this hotel might have been acceptable, but not here, not in Chicago, not in any major US city.Would have been much better to spend the extra 200 and stay at the Willows one block away.We apologize about the issues you had while staying at our hotel. We are not sure why you had issues with the hot water. We had not received any complaints so it may have been isolated to your room only.

"Last trip I refrained from reviewing after a rather bad experience. I believed it was a one shot occurrence. Last trip, I was given room keys that didn't work for the parking. Returned to the desk and received a lukewarm sorry. I stayed for 4 nights. My room was left completely un-cleaned one day and not well cleaned the other. When I informed the front desk, another lukewarm sorry. After I asked to see the manager, the desk person offered reward points instead because the manager was not available. Arrived today, front parking attendant asked for my car key while I checked into the hotel. Mind you, the front desk is in view from the entry way. I haven't been asked that in the last 2 visits. I asked him why and he said that people parked there and left their cars. He needed my key in case I did that. He reluctantly gave me a ticket after I asked - his reasoning was I can see you from here at the desk. Huh Wasn't that my reasoning as well except as the customer A rewards member, I was asked for my information though the person making the reservation a month ago took all my information. Got my keys - one opens the parking deck and one opens the room door, but neither does both. Can't wait to see what else I encounter while here.",Bad

"Worst experience ever! We were in ATL to attend the Alabama vs Virginia Tech game. Lots going on in Atlanta this weekend, the game, the Braves, Nascar, Dragacon, and more. We were excited to get a room downtown so last minute, when we made the reservation only 4 days earlier. We went to check in early and the rooms were not ready. OJ at front desk told us we could go ahead and park and check in after the game. We asked twice if we needed a parking pass and were told no. Parked below the motel and walked almost 2 miles to the Dome. Rather than have a huge towing bill and walk 2 miles we would have driven and paid 40 and parked near the Dome. Called after the game to make sure we were still good and let them know we would check in late to please not give up our room. We were assured everything was fine and we needed to check in my midnight, we got to the hotel with five minutes to spare. The night clerk proceeded to check up in and pulled out a parking pass. RED FLAG!!!! We told him we had asked for one early in the day and didn't receive one. My husband ran down to check and sure enough our truck had been towed. The clerk wanted us to check in our room and spend the night and deal with our missing truck the next day. NO WAY!!! All of our belongings were in our truck. When we finally found out where if had been towed we had to take a cab across town. Luckily we had a wonderful cab driver who helped us out a lot, stayed with us until he was sure we would get our truck back and warned us about quickly getting out of the area and not stopping because we were in a very bad part of town. The tow company wouldn't accept my debit or credit card, they needed my husbands. Thankfully I had some cash (which I rarely have). We finally got our truck and drove the very late 2 hour drive home. We found out that 10 vehicles were towed from this location that night. We feel very strongly that this was a scam between the desk clerk and the tow company. The man at the impound lot told us he had never know of them taking cars from this location until yesterday when they got 10 from there. Don't be the next victim.",Bad

"This was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, we travel a lot and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I have reviewed a lot of hotels and I rarely leave a bad review, but this was too disgusting to not address.We were moving my cousin to Orlando, and needed a late night hotel last minute. We picked the best western, in hind sight I wish we had slept in the car. We checked in around 1 am. Once we got settled in and ready for bed, we started seeing small roaches crawling out from behind the painting above our bed. My husband killed the 2 that we saw. We were a little grossed out but that late at night, we didn't have many options. The next morning we woke up to more roaches crawling around the painting. Then we saw a couple of huge ones above the TV. After seeing this we wondered how many more were in the room. We grabbed our stuff went to front desk and told them. She refunded us 50 . My husband emailed the manager STUART BLOOMBERG about this. He emailed us back and told us the exterminators came and said the room was perfectly clean and there wasn't a single roach. So either we saw the only 4 roaches in the room or someone is not being honest. My husband relayed to Stuart how grossed out we were and asked for the remainder of balance to be refunded. Stuart told us he can't do that the roaches must have entered the room when we opened the door to enter the room ourselves. At this point not only were we disgusted by the pest infested room but also insulted by the manager that he would accuse us of letting the roaches in. We are realistic, a bug here and there is normal, but a roach infested room is a sign of filth. We are so disappointed, what a waste of money, and such poor customer service. STAURT BLOOMBERG offered us 50 off on our next stay, as if we would EVER go back to that hotel. I have never left a hotel feeling this disgusted. A word of advice to the manager of this hotel, don't blame your customers for your hotels lack of hygiene. Unprofessional staff, filthy hotel, stay somewhere else.Dear Deepti DI really appreciate you taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize again as did my staff did for the failure in our extermination program. My staff did reduce your stay to 50 off before you checked out.A pest free environment is basic for a good stay. I am sorry if that was not the case during your stay. You can be confident that we did follow-up on your concerns, so that others are not disappointed as you were.Again, thank you for making the effort to share your thoughts.

"I picked this location because it was close to MCO, relatively affordable, and had a free airport shuttle. The room was ok, though is showing wear (for example, bathroom tiles were cracked and some grout was missing). The linens were very cheap and coarse (I quite literally got rug burn on my elbow from rolling over in the night). The shuttle to the airport in the morning was fine, but I couldn't get the front desk to stay on the line long enough to get picked up from the airport after returning my rental car (seriously irritating when someone answers the phone and immediately puts you on hold before taking 30 seconds or less to understand the reason for the call). I spent about 10 minutes on hold (despite trying to call 3 different times) and eventually took a cab to the hotel (which annoyed the cabbie greatly since it was a short fare).Given this experience, I wouldn't recommend staying here unless it's the cheapest cost. It was reasonably quiet and I slept ok all things considered, but there are several options in the immediate vicinity.Dear Falconsview, thank you for sharing your experience and for being our guest. While overall you had a pleasant stay, we are unhappy with the lack of service received from our front desk staff. Please accept our apologies for any inconveniences that you experienced being put on hold for so long.

"We stayed at this hotel last year for 10 nights and while the rooms weren't completely up to date, it was clean, had extra room, breakfast was decent, and for the price we felt we got a great deal. Based on our past experience, we booked again for a family reunion and referred our family to also book this hotel. We arrived late at night and check in was fine. The lobby still looked nice and the elevator was still slow like we remembered. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room and turned the bed down were the yellow stains on the sheets. At this point I wasn't sure if the sheets had been laundered and they were permanent stains, or if the sheets had not been changed. I called the front desk and they had me come get a new set of sheets. By the time I got back up to the room, my husband had discovered the towels hanging in the bathroom had fresh lipstick/makeup all over them. I went back to talk to the front desk and the employee decided it was time to try a different room. Room 2 had a ant on top of the pillows on the bed and when we turned down the bed and pulled the pillows away from the headboard out ran 10 more. Back to the front desk we went and were now headed off to room 3. When opening the door to Room 3 we were immediately hit with what I can only describe as B.O. and it was potent. I called the front desk and told them about the smell and told them we would tough it out for the night as it was getting super late and we had a baby with us. I asked when the manager would be in the next day and was told 10 a.m. I ran the air vent on the airconditioner and also turned on the bathroom exhaust fan all night. The next morning the smell was as bad as ever. It literally was oozing out of everything in the room-the mattress, the couch. There were ants in this room also, but they were crawling on the wall instead of instead of in the bed. I headed down to visit with the manager of the hotel and found he was out due to an emergency. I expressed my concerns to the staff that was there (the housekeeping supervisor and a young gentleman) and asked to cancel the rest of my stay as well as the reservations for my family that would be arriving in town later in the week. The housekeeping supervisor came up to the room and acknowledged the smell and thought that it was possibly wet carpet-my opinion was that the room smelled due to body odor and not cleaning the room thoroughly. The only rooms the hotel had left were double rooms and she offered to let me walk through one before moving all of my belongings again, but I declined as we had already switched rooms 3 times and I also was very concerned about how many times my family coming into town would have to switch rooms to find an acceptable one.This hotel has drastically gone down hill in cleanliness since we stayed here last year. The linens in all of the rooms were stained and the towels were threadbare and grey. There were ants in 2 of the 3 rooms we checked into that night. I felt this hotel was along the lines of a motel 6 at best. Free breakfast cannot make up for a filthy hotel that is not being cleaned properly. We actually witnessed a maid RUNNING into and out of a room in less than 5 minutes. How do you clean a room that fast And we certainly didn't see a vacuum. We were wondering if the maids were paid by the room and not the hour. I do want to say the front desk staff was very accommodating and tried their hardest to find an acceptable room and I appreciate that they were willing to cancel our reservations when they realized their hotel had too many issues. ****PLEASE HIRE A SUPERVISOR FOR YOUR MAIDS AND INVEST IN REPL.ACING OLD/STAINED LINENS AND TOWELS***Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at the Comfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area in San Diego.

I booked without checking reviews. My fault. Because they all are accurate ! Bad. The phone in room didn't work there were no light bulbs in any lights. Only over sink and in bathroom. The sheets were clean. The toilet wouldn't flush but discovered why because it runs all the time. Bath tub area had mold in all the seams.... More,Bad
"When we got there to check in, they made us pay a 50 deposit per room that they neglected to mention on the phone when the rooms were booked. So instead of renting two rooms as planned, we had to rent just one.The A/C in the room was terrible, it hardly cooled the room down - probably because the insulation was so bad you could see the sunlight around the edges of the room door (which also meant you could hear every person running by and yelling at all hours). The sink in our room also clogged several times.We found several cockroaches crawling in various places (including the bed). We all have random bug bites now, probably from mosquitoes coming in thanks to the poorly sealed door. There were odd stains on the ceiling as well.The free WIFI came in and out, and it interrupts your browsing with full in-browser ads, which actually gave our laptop a virus. It slowed down our computer noticeably during our stay so we checked when we got home and had to remove it.They gave us two tiny bottles of shampoo (no conditioner) and two bars of soap, for a room that's supposed to sleep four people. Three towels, and two hand towels. There was no ice machine, and you have to pay for a mini fridge. They also had no complimentary breakfast in the mornings.All in all, a huge disappointment and we definitely will not be staying at this hotel again. Don't recommend it to anyone else.",Bad

"I'm a big fan of Best Western Hotels, because the majority of them accomodate my German Shepherd dog, this one is no exception except the other reason that I like Best Western is because the majority of them are designed well, and are well maintained, and offer rooms that feel fresh and clean, the Best Western Mission Bay seems to be the exception to the rule. The main parking lot features a poor design, it is difficult to navigate when stuffed full of trucks, and other vehicles that should have been parked in the overflow lot provided to the side of the hotel. There were derelicts floating about the hotel and parking lot, which made me wonder whether my car and the contents would be there when I awoke in the morning, I was on a road trip back to Mexico with a full load and didn't really want to have to unpack an entire SUV late at night and have to try to piece it all back together in the morning. The room felt stale and just not clean, although I'm sure that it was, it just didn't feel clean, or look clean, the place is in need of an overhaul and I feel that I could have just crashed at a Motel 6 and left the next day feeling like I needed a shower just the same.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.I apologize you were unable to find a parking space by your room. We do have a large parking lot adjacent to the property were lots of our guest are allowed to park as well. We are always striving to improve, We would be more than happy to offer you a discounted rate in the future so we can have another opportunity to show you an excellent experience.

"I basically live out of hotels and this is the WORST I have ever seen. Staring with parking you are paying 12.00 for a spot that you have to do a 3 point turn to get into and my Camry almost didnt fit into. The room was super small for being a family suite and everything was cramped. The was enough space between the foot of the bed and the tv table was wide enough for a vacuum to fit though as well as the space between the bed and the wall. The second room was divided by a French door only the fixed side of the French door had window covering so there is no privacy between rooms and the lights from either room shines into each other. The AC was weak and smelt like mold. The second room never got air and by the time you go to the bathroom forget it just open the window to let the air in. There is no circulation, except what was provided by a large fan in the wall between rooms that was extremely loud and reminded me of an attic fan. One good thing the bed was comfortable for a single night stay. This location does offer breakfast, but after making a waffle and getting a plate together and sitting down to eat each of us took a bite and ended up at Dennys down the street. I wasnt expecting a Hilton or the Ritz Carlton, but I was expecting something a little higher than what ended up looking like highway motel. Lucky for us we were there only one night before heading home to Los Angeles.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. I greatly appreciate your comments about aspects of the room that need updating. It is a pleasure to announce that we will be implementing many of these upgrades to the property within the next couple of months. Our rooms will be getting new mattresses, bed skirts, window treatments, carpeting, in-room accessories, and much more! In taking great care of our charming hotel, our main priority is to be able to offer a very well-maintained and comfortable atmosphere. I hope that I can convince you to change your mind about another visit to our property.

"Picked this Hotel, because it was within walking distance of a concert venue my mistake (I should have done more research). Sadly, the area is not the best (within one block east south there are considerable numbers of poor unfortunate people living on the sidewalk, in tents, in cardboard boxes and cars). Although, we did not have any trouble whatsoever we did witness open (injected) drug use on the street. Some may call it edgy or off the tourist track. Certainly not a place for families with young children to visit. During our visit we met a retired SF Social worker who told us Hyde St. (300s) is one of the dirtiest locations in the city and a good many of this former clients came from around that area.The hotel building (c.1904) was clean inside and the staff more than helpful. Out first room, on the fourth floor, although a double, was a disappointment very small and cramped, no draw space, tiny shower room, single glazing, overlooking the main street, very noisy (there is an Emergency Hospital directly opposite with vehicles coming in though-out the night).Our second room (floor two) was much larger, with ample cupboard/draw space and a bath and was situated at the rear of the building clean, but, again a little tired.There are a few places to eat nearby again, some care would be needed, not to go down the wrong street.The nearest public transport (Cable Car on the California line) is two blocks to the north and a 20minute ride will connect you with the downtown financial district.Pros: Price!Cons: Location.Visit Again: No, sadly, the adjacent area is too distressed.We were pleased to host you during your stay in San Francisco, and we hope that you enjoyed your trip to the city. It is also good to hear that the hotel itself was good, and we trust that you rested well. We know that the homelessness that is evident throughout the city can be very disconcerting for those who are not used to it, and we are sorry that you found aspects of this to be so off-putting. Please know that this is replicated throughout the city. Thankfully, our guests are never approached by people, and despite appearances, our area is very safe. Our building and some of our furniture are quite old, but we trust that you noticed the wonderful standard of cleanliness and upkeep that we maintain, and we hope that this did not detract from your stay too much. Overall, we are sorry that you did not enjoy your time here more. Best wishes, Hotel Management",Bad
"Yes the receptionist was very professional, and upon enterence into the hotel it was nice and the breakfast was good. However I choose this hotel because of the name and it did not meet the standards that I'm use to when staying at a Wingate Hotel and for the price it truely did not match. The pictures looked better online than in person. The door to the hotel room did not open properly, the toilet was very loose and when me or the kids sat on it, it shook - the tub was not properly cleaned so we used the towels to put down on the bottom of the tub. The money I spent on the room did not match the quality of the hotel's name which is why I choose it. For what we got we could have stayed at a motel 6 for a approximately half the price. The computer really sits by the front door and not in a computer room.The location was O.K.Please accept my sincere apology regarding your recent stay at the BRAND of Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. Teyonna what you experienced is not the standard we strive to uphold. We have reviewed our procedures and made appropriate changes to prevent this from occurring in the future.

We stayed there for multiple nights and from a family of six three of us became sick and after passing it off as exhaustion we later found black mold on our clothes. Headaches sore throats and rashes and coughing all night .we stayed in a room right across from the pool which may have increased the mold and to honest I'm not from a high humidity area so maybe this is common but we have stayed other places in Anaheim for longer and have not experienced this. Everyone says we just need a place to sleep and nothing great .that's what you get here.,Bad
"We have traveled extensively prior, and have stayed at many hostels of similar price range, this one however, is a whole new experience for us. At the check in, the staff opened not with the availabilities of their facilities, but with the offer of free alcohol, every single day. What they didn't say, was that the staff themselves drank most of the free booze, and were hungover most of their shifts. The were more interested in sharing their drunken antics rather than providing any help to the customers. There was only one girl Billy who spoke English (and she's the least useful one out of them all), the rest of the staff spoke very little English and had trouble understanding us.The free alcohol turned lots of the hostel guests into violent drunks, who threw knives at each other in the kitchen whilst cooking.Hostel was extremely noisy and was impossible to sleep without earplugs. The mattress was creaky and filthy, and we didn't even dare to cover ourselves with their blankets, on which we had presumed was dried blood.",Bad

"My husband and I were excited to stay at Estancia last week to celebrate my 30th birthday. Upon check-in, here are the things we noticed in our room that led us to believe it wasnt a luxury resort, as claimed:-Dirty diaper in our bathroom garbage-Dirty towels in a heap-Items in fridge from last guest-Opened water bottles (included in the outrageous 22/day resort fee)We were very nice about this and called the front desk just to mention it and ask for new water bottles although I think we should have made more of a fuss because a dirty diaper is pretty disgusting.What makes me the most upset about this resort is the service from the concierge. My parents ordered a cheese plate and bottle of wine to be delivered to our room upon our arrival because that was the day of my birthday. My mom was guaranteed that it would be delivered to our room within 30-45 minutes of our check-in, which would mean that the gift was delivered on my actual birthday. We did not receive the cheese plate or bottle of wine that day. On Saturday, just before noon, we received a cheese plate delivered to our room. I immediately contacted my parents to say thank you for the cheese plate, and my mom asked if there had been a bottle of wine with it, which I told her there had not. She contacted the hotel, got no answer, and left a message. I called in-room dining to inquire about the wine. They told me that they thought they would deliver the cheese plate in the morning and the wine after dinner. If someone orders wine and cheese as a gift, its because they want them to be enjoyed together, so this was obviously a lie.This entire time, my mom had been dealing with Gabby, who was rude, interrupted her, and didnt let her speak. When Gabby called back, my mom complained that the gift was not delivered on my birthday as promised, and was not delivered in its entirety. Gabby assured my mom that she would take some money off because of this, but my mom checked her banking and she had been charged an additional 35. When my mom called Gabby to talk about this, Gabby did apologize. However, she was still incredibly rude and told her that I had actually received the wine and cheese on Friday, but that I just didnt call my mom to thank her and that I lied when I said we didnt receive anything Friday. So not only was our room dirty upon check in, with a dirty diaper and more, but my mom tried to do something nice for us and the hotel has responded by being incredibly rude and accusing us of lying. The 35 has been taken off, but my parents are still paying full price for a gift that wasnt delivered on time, having to contact the hotel 6-7 times while my mom was on vacation, and being accused of lying.I left a voicemail for the manager two days ago and have not heard back. I will never stay at this luxury resort again.Thank you for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us on Trip Advisor. Your experience was certainly not indicative of our service standards, and it is simply saddening to read of your negative experience. We are though, happy that we are given this opportunity to personally apologize for the multiple mishaps you encountered during your stay. We know how important the little things are (especially on ones birthday) and I regret that we are unable to go back and fix the situation first hand. We appreciate your comments and will be researching the situation in more depth in order to prevent any experience such as yours from reoccurring.

"Let me start off by saying I am a marriott Gold Status member who logged 50+ nights at Marriotts last year and year-to-date has logged 41 nights with Marriott. I'm always on the lookout for reasonably priced business hotels. Let's just say that this isn't one of them. Several Cons about the hotel and rooms:- There are no irons in the rooms, you have to go to a communal ironing room. This makes it weird when you have to get dressed in the morning to go iron your clothes. For the road warrior who likes to iron in the AM after they get out of the shower, it makes it awkward.. - The showers are literally in the bedroom with no defined bathroom area. When you get out of the shower onto the wood floors, you get water all over the floors next to your bed area. - The rooms are the sizes of coffins. - There is absolutely no storage in the rooms for clothes (no closet, no real hanger system to hang work shirts or coats, no drawers. You have no option other than to live out of a suitcase, which is even a problem because there is no real benching area or room to put your suitcase. The goal of this hotel is to create an experience for the guest. They want the guest to be driven out of the room to the common area lobbies to spend time with other guests and to spend money in the lobby. Unfortunately for those of us who need to do work or are looking for some relaxing quiet time, this hotel doesn't allow you to accomplish that. When you are in the lobby, they are blaring club music and at night times, they have a DJ who also blares club music. It's just a lot of crummy club music. The other issue I had was the excessive promotion of alcohol consumption. It was no stop. Although I enjoy alcohol, I could see how someone who didn't or who is in recovery from alcohol could feel weird when staying here. For someone who has stayed at Marriotts roughly 50 times per year for business and for pleasure, i would never recommend someone going to this hotel. It's a terrible hotel with minimal space and an overarching desire to try to be overly cool. I can't stress how much i actually hated staying at this hotel. It was terrible.Hello 575bjacobs,We are so sorry to hear about the poor experience you had at the Moxy Chicago. Our goal is for our guests to be comfortable and enjoy all of our unique amenities and we hate that we let you down. We value every bit of feedback - good, bad, and in-between.

When I called to inquire about this. I spoke to Jenny, the same nice,cheerful rep I saw when I checked in. I guess that was a front! She was very RUDE! She was talking over me and insisted it was a bank error and not Hampton Inn fault. She kept saying what does your reciet say I told her the recit states the correct amount, however, I was charged a addional night. She still was rude and nasty! I asked ti speak to the geneal manager, and she kept saying she was in a meeting. I told Jenny how this has compromised my account,and I need reinbursement. She hung up on me!! I will NEVER stay there again!! I advise everyone to check your account twice! They will jip you!!Dear Guest,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimiter Center.

"You'll never get to sleep. The only advantage of the continuously loud, throbbing dance music is that it drowns out the traffic noise from the street. I, too, was suckered by the glowing reviews, but in reality, this is a refurbished motel that has cleverly marketed itself as a hip destination spot. It's located in a nondescript area of town, and the furnishings are Ikea-quality generic modern. The pool is small and filled with plastic balls, making it all but unusable. The attraction of this place seems to be the bar, which unfortunately is in an open courtyard, which means you get to hear the music all night, whether you want to or not. The crowd is young, as is the staff. If you are, too, and are on vacation, you might like this place. But don't stay here for business.",Bad
"We were given a room infested with fleas. First noticed while lying in bed and got bit. Thought it was a fleeting incident and left for the day. That night I was in bed and felt them on me, I got up walked across room and saw fleas were all over my lower legs. Needless to say I did not sleep that night. First thing in the morning asked for a new room and they did move us, however I was paranoid the fleas got into my things and would come home with me. So I felt very anxious and uncomfortable the rest of my stay. I have bite marks all over my legs. They didn't even offer a discount of any kind off that room price.Thank you for taking the time to write your review. I am very sorry that happened during your stay. I am very glad we were able to move you to another room, and we have gotten the original room taken care of. We do have a cleaning policy in place when we know a pet has been in a room. There was no record of any pets in that room for several months. Unfortunately, it sounds like someone may have had a pet in that room without us knowing.

I think the price for the rooms was overpriced. The room was not very clean for the and the exhaust fan in the bathroom was very loud. There is a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The refrigerator did keep the stuff cold.,Bad
"Was hesitant about this hotel after reading some of the reviews and my fears came to life as soon as we checked in. We had a room on the first floor with a kitchenette which smelled awful - evidently a souvenier from the last meal cooked there. The hotel is very outdated. I was told by the very nice desk clerk (who took me around the hotel attempting to find us another room) that they are in the process of updating Not to sure about that. Hotel is right on the strand. There is no A/C in the hallways and it appears that windows are usually kept open. We were supposed to stay two nights but left after one. Probably a great place for families on a budget with small children. Oh yeah, continental breakfast is juice boxes and poptarts basically. It is a good location though.",Bad
"I recently stayed at this property as it was listed as a three-diamond under AAA ratings and had bunk beds for my two young children. This hotel is not as nice as advertised. The room I had showed its age as it was looking dirty and worn. I also had one of the worst experiences I have ever had with the hotel personnel and management. Their customer service was very poor. On the second night of our stay the Toilet backed up a around 8:30 P.M. I called the front desk and was told there was no one who could fix it so I could move to another room. I declined this, as it would have taken at least an hour and a half to pack up, move, unpack and set up the room. My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive. I couldnt believe that they didnt have anyone who could plunge the toiled as this hotel has over 125 rooms. I asked if they had a plunger and the desk person stated he would look. He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused, and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service, she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel, or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information. I asked for the name of who hired her she stated herself, I asked if she was the owner. She again would only say she didnt have that information. Earlier I had asked for compensation for the situation she insulting only offered to pay for the plunger. In the room was a card titled commitment to your Satisfaction, It stated states that if youre not satisfied with our accommodations or service, please the front desk know so we can make it right. At this property from the general manager on down they do not follow this policy. They definitely did not make it right.",Bad

"We booked this accommodation in February, and paid in May, but when we arrived there in June an extremely unhelpful receptionist threw us a piece of paper which stated they were overbooked and we would have to stay at the Quality Inn around a mile away.He then reluctantly gave us directions after being asked a few times. I know all hotels overbook but surely it's common courtesy to let you know before you arrive after a 9 hour flight and a couple of more hours getting through immigration, picking up a car and driving there.",Bad
"Centrally located, close to Pike Place and other key points of interest. Room was spacious, but unfortunately, I really missed their wonderful Heavenly Beds! They must not have these beds at this location, as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further, the water pressure in my room, located on the 10th floor, was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa, thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle. My apologies, as it sounds like we failed to meet your expectations during your stay. We are always striving to make our guests' experience an amazing one, so your comments are extremely valuable to us to ensure we can make that happen. I do hope you'll give us another try and allow us to WOW you as we should have the first time. Thanks again.",Bad
"Your first difficulty if you drive to this location is going to be parking. Expect to pay up to 16.50 a day to park your car 2 blocks away at a parking garage. Once you get to the hotel you will need to climb 18 very steep stairs to get to the check in desk. No elevator. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful. Some of the rooms have windows that open into the hallway. I am sure that this may be quaint for some, but a huge privacy issue for others even if there is a blind that you can pull down. There are shared bathrooms (2 total) and you may be sharing it with 20 + other people. 2 showers are also shared. Not a lot of privacy. If your neighbors are loud, you will hear every single thing that is going on in the room next to you. The location is great with really everything within walking distance. Over all, this is an over priced hostel.Dear teasippinglou,Thank you for the nice comments about our location, cleanliness, and staff. Were sorry that there were some points that you did not meet with your approval. Bringing a car to San Francisco and parking it can be an expensive proposition. We advise guests to leave their cars at home, but we welcome those on a road trip and love them ourselves. Our rate for overnight parking is one of the best values in San Francisco. By comparison the hotel directly across from where we send our guests to park charges 45 per night and we charge only 16. Nob Hill hotels charge 60 per night and downtown hotels charge 62. So we feel our parking rate is very modest and a true value in keeping with our budget prices geared towards value-oriented travelers.The San Remo was built in 1906 and had no elevator. If anyone needs help with their baggage we would gladly bring their luggage up the one flight. The San Remo is only three stories high, is fully sprinkler-equipped, and is not required to have an elevator. Our stairs are up to code and are well lit. Were sorry that you missed some of our other bathing facilities but there are seven showers and a vintage claw-foot bathtub. They are all fully private and there is seldom any wait to use them. We are an historic Victorian hotel and not a hostel, although we are popular with backpackers looking for some comfort at a reasonable price. As far as our rates, we are well below the average for San Francisco. Rates within one block of our hotels great location range from 200 to 489. We have not had any complaints about privacy of our inside corridor rooms. They all have lace curtains and window shades. As far as noise, our walls are as thick as most other hotels, but due to the fact that we have no televisions which create a white-noise effect you may hear sounds that would normally be drowned out by them. We do provide ear plugs if needed.We hope you give us another try on your next trip from Alaska. When you return could you please say hello to Santa Claus for usTom Field",Bad
"Disappointed with the condition of the hotel. One of the rooms we booked had cardboard and tape covering the window. The refrigerator was not working and spoiled the food we put in it. No manager on duty and the manager is slow to respond. Several days later they responded they were sorry by email, however its been 2 weeks now and no further response on making right the situation.Dear Jeff R,Thank you for your recent review. The primary AC unit had failed. So we placed a temporary unit in the room. This was the reason for why the tape and cardboard. It was repaired upon check out. I did not get a notification on the fridge not working during your stay. I do apologize for both of these issues you had. These are not common occurrences as you can tell by other reviews on this site. If you would can you call me at the hotel and we can speak more about thisKindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager",Bad
"I booked site unseen as I am a Best Western Rewards member. This hotel is older than the seven seas! The outside is old and needs maintenance, appearing more like a highway side trucker motel than a hotel. Rooms are old and musty, with water and moisture damage radiating from the bottom of the exterior door and bathroom door. I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy. Room appeared clean at first glance, but tile floor in shower/toilet area needed scrubbing and vanity looked like it was never dusted. Shower water was luke warm.Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities to meet the needs of our guests. Rest assured your concerns are being shared with the appropriate departments in order to be discussed. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Thank you! -Team BW7S",Bad

"If I could give this hotel zero stars, that's what I would do. I thought it was really that lousy. There is no breakfast service, the wi-fi is very slow and undependable, and these clowns gave me a hotel room where the phone did not work. They should just tear down this ghetto hotel and make sure all of their workers are out of a job. They should've given me another room, but no. I am NEVER staying here again.",Bad
"I had booked a reservation through Priceline.com for a non-smoking room. When I arrived at the hotel I was informed succinctly that my reservation came through for a smoking room. Although there were non-smoking rooms available, I was charged 11 to change to a non-smoking room. Calls from customer service agents at Priceline had no effect at all. The front desk clerk admitted to me that this happens very frequently (every day she said) to people who book through Priceline or Hotwire. I believe this hotel is running a scam to earn extra revenue by charging unsuspecting customers extra money for non-smoking rooms. Shameful. I will never stay there again.Let me start by thanking you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our property. I apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We strive to ensure each and every guest experience is satisfying. Please know that we are taking your feedback to heart and focusing on improving. As you know when you buy your room through hotwire / priceline with name your price you are giving up lot of prevallage, such as choice of your hotel, room type ect. This type of booking channel will give you deep discount but any guest request is subject to availabity, if we don't have same room type we offer guest choice to upgrade to diffrent room type and pay the diffrence (once again this upgrade is subject to availability). I advice if guest has specific need please book through Bestwestern.com and select room type of their need. Each room type and rates are clearly explain.

"The rooms are terribly dated and run-down. The A/C in my room had a death rattle that kept me up all night. Gets two stars instead of one for friendly staff and convenient airport shuttle.

Im sorry to hear that there was a problem with the air conditioning unit in your room. Although we are diligent with our preventative maintenance program, mechanical challenges can sometimes occur unexpectedly. Once our staff is notified, however, we are usually able to correct the issue quickly and efficiently. I do apologize that you found your room to be dated.

"I travel often to San Francisco (1-2 times a month) and while recently planning on going with my friends for a vacation I booked at Hotel Abri. Trying to save money, I found a decent deal for a hotel that had good reviews here. While not going into further detail, but noting that I had difficulty in checking-in due to housekeeping being short-staffed, there was much issue.The BIGGEST issue I had here was with getting spider bites from sleeping on the sofa bed. After showing the front desk, and after their inspection came out negative, they moved me rooms, but that was it. I still haven't heard back from a manager and was not offered any sort of compensation.I would suggest not going cheap and staying at the Parc 55 across the street.Dear Luke H.,Thank you for your time and for providing us with the details of your experience while staying with us at Hotel AbRi, I want to let you know that I am aware of the multiple interactions/communications with you regarding your check in, stay and insect bites, I want to assure you again that we have followed up with the staff and pest control teams with the same procedures as we communicated to you at the end of your stay that there was no evidence of pests in the room, after our professional vendor inspected and treated the room, we also provided you with the findings and communication. I want to again formally apologize to you and your guests for the multiple interactions and confusion regarding the check in, as our check in time is 3:00pm, however we always try to accommodate guests requests, and our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests, we were sold out the night before and also on the day of your arrival the requests are challenging to grant as our check out time is 12 noon. Also our apologies for the confusion on your reservation made by the third party which provided you with a One deluxe room with double double beds, not a two bedroom room, as stated, our front desk team did upgrade you to one of our Urban Suites to provide you with more space and a better stay for you and your guests. I am very sorry that even with the steps we took to upgrade your room type we failed to provide you a great stay, as this situation does not reflect our Hotel AbRis core values, style or caring approach, we totally understand your point of view, but we would like to let you know that our teams are diligently working with our third party partners to resolve these type of situations, so it would not affect other guests as it affected you. However this is not an excuse for the actions or scenario you described, during your stay we really tried to provide you with all the upgraded amenities our Urban welcome provides, but as we can see we fail on the communication and we will work on getting better. I can assure you that the sequences of events you have presented are not in any way, our teams guest service standards or company goals. I want you to know our leadership and service team have followed the procedures as we are truly concern and sadden by the details of your experience, and we want to again apologize on this format as we have done for the past days during communications with you. I would like to request from you another opportunity to further discuss and try to turn this situation from a negative experience to a positive, as we value our guests feedback. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800, we are anxious to show you the caring, casual and family atmosphere we promote in our Hotel. Thank you again for your feedback and I look forward to speaking with you. Have a great day!EJ Varela Hotel Manager",Bad
"The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you.

"The area was just off a busy freeway in what we described as the stripper neighborhood. I needed early checkin which I arranged months ago. Didn't get it.

They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd, I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No, we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no, fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left. Thank you for your feedback. I apologize that we were unable to fix your air conditioning issue immediately.

I am sorry that the staff that you spoke with were not more empathetic, but they did offer you alternate accommodations.

"Do not stay at the hotel Allegro if you value professional courtesy, stable internet connections, or not being subjected to overhearing whatever television show or casual conversation in which the next room is engaged. The beds are small as well. If you're over 6 ft like me, stay somewhere else. Most infuriating of all was my experience with the internet. It was down consistently. It turns out that there was an issue with the router on my floor -- which in and of itself is not a deal breaker. But they asked me to call their tech support staff, which is odd because the guests shouldn't be the ones troubleshooting internet connectivity. I spoke with the technician for around 25 minutes before he figured out the cause. By this point, the meeting that I was supposed to be attending via teleconference was almost halfway over. I marched to the front desk and asked for a new room and was made to feel like a criminal. One of the desk staff actually smirked at me as I described my difficulties. I lost business because I stayed here. Do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake of staying at the Hotel Allegro.Ouch!

"I wish I had the opportunity to rate my experience at this hotel, but I never got the chance to even book my reservation.I had done a lot of resarch on hotels for my upcoming visit to San Francisco in two months, and was very pleased to find the Orchard Garden Hotel. When I did more research, I discovered in the specials section of their website that they offer a discounted rate of 149 for a superior king room when you book three consecutive nights (San Francisco Triple Play special valid through 8/31). When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of 213 a night, 64 more a night!Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention.Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts. I'm very disappointed.",Bad

"So the hotel has a shuttle service from the airport that they told me about when I contacted them earlier in the day. Very pleasant lady I spoke with and extremely helpful. Got off the plane and called to let them know we were here. The driver will be there shortly (remember that phrase, there's a pattern here). Waited 20 minutes and called back same phrase. Did that twice more. The last time I called with attitude she told me the driver had just picked someone up on the A side and after he dropped them off, they would come back for us (the A spots were just across the street). Well, I was none too pleased to put it mildly after waiting that long. Had she been upfront with us, we would have taken a cab the 1 mile or so, which we ended up doing. When we got here to check in, her comment was, instead of I'm sorry for the inconvenience, it was not my problem, they are short a driver tonight. What!!! When I asked to speak to a manager, she said no, there is no manager here and you can deal with me. WHAT!!! It went downhill from there. Can't believe the attitude that was being thrown my way from some twenty year old. Finally just took my keys and left (fortunately I had already checked in online) was a long day. The rooms were adequate although there were mystery smears on the inside of the bathroom door. Went to speak with the front desk this morning but he was again a twenty year old (I guess get done with high school and start working at the hilton). Well, luckily again, I have more Hilton Honors points than I can ever use (and have in the past loved the customer service they provide) at least I didn't have to pay for this experience. There are so many other hotels right here, I suggest avoiding this Hilton at all costs. Looking forward to putting this ordeal behind me and getting on the cruise ship and having the drink of the day.We are very sorry to have provided you with a poor lodging experience and for this, please accept my personal apologies.

"We stayed at this Courtyard in Oct. 2007, and booked well in advance of our arrival. We used marriott.com to book the room, and reserved a room with two double beds and a balcony (the website lists details about each room type available).Upon arriving at the hotel, the front desk clerk (only one for a line of 5 parties checking-in) advised us that our room was XYZ. When I asked if the room had a balcony and two beds, he said that there were no rooms of that type left. We had a dialogue back and forth, and I said that I reserved a room with a balcony and two beds, and that's what I wanted to get, or else I would go to the Hilton Garden Inn, where I am a Hilton Silver member and spend about 50 less per night. The clerk pulled up the hotel web site and tried to insist to me that a specific room type is not guaranteed rather, they are just guidelines. However, I made it very clear that each available room type listed amenities specific to that room (i.e. double balcony room, XYZ square feet, balcony XYZ square feet, etc.). He was very insistent and offended me with his refusal to admit that, in this case, I was right. To make a long story short, the clerk accomodated us with a one queen bed plus sofabed room with a balcony. The importance of the balcony was because my friend smokes and the entire hotel is smoke-free otherwise. Why the clerk had not suggested this prior to our 15 minute debate is beyond me. Not a good start to this stay.On to the hotel property and facilities. There is plenty of parking. Even with the Mountain Dew/X games convention staying there, there was plenty of parking available, even late at night,. The hotel facilities are relatively new, with lots of bright light and marble. Rooms are decorated nicely, but are average in size. The bed was very comfortable I was told the sofa bed was not that comortable (to be expected, I guess). The balcony was definitely a good size, but overlooked the gas station next door. The bathroom was small, but had good water pressure and a massaging shower head.With regards to the Courtyard's location, I would not say it is unsafe. It is located in downtown Orlando. If you are intimidated by being in a city, then you will most likely be intimidated by the hotel's location. However, there is no need to worry about running into trouble in this part of the city. Simply follow normal night time procedures for being aware of your surroundings, as you should anywhere after dark. The biggest complaint I had about this stay was the noise level. Due to there being tons of teenagers staying here with the previously mentioned convention, we heard yelling and skateboarding in the parking lot at all hours of the night. We also heard other guests yelling out their sliding doors for them to shut up, and arguments ensued. This was around 4-5am. Hotel staff, where were you Someone needed to get this rediculous noise under control. The walls here are very thin, and banging could be heard on adjacent floors of the hotel.The air conditioner in our room would not cool adequately. Even on the high cool setting, it would turn off at about 72 degrees I would say. So after spending the day in the 90+ degree heat, we couldn't get cooled down well enough. And at night it was rather warm. Not to mention that the A/C could not drown out all the noise, because it was off most of the time. There is no constant cool option to override the auto thermostat temp feature of the A/C. Both low cool and high cool switch on and off based on the temp you select. So overall, I was not impressed by the service or general atmosphere of this Courtyard. I have stayed at Hampton Inns that are much nicer, with better customer service. This stay confirmed for me why I frequent Hiltons and their sister properties as opposed to Marriotts. I would not recommend this hotel based on my stay. There are many other fine hotels of this caliber in Orlando, so do yourself a favor and stay at one of the them.",Bad
I have stayed at days inn in the past this was the worst stay I have ever had I am disabled my friends were to stay close by to help me that is the way the rooms were rented that is not what happened they were put upstairs no air conditioner no phone hook up and maintence said what do you want for 40 dollars the worst stay I ever had the front desk girl 2nd shift very rude not acceptable,Bad
"Illegal activity going on the parking lot when we arrived. There was women standing next to motels doors waiting to be served or get served no working vending machines for a soft drink. Black mold growing in the ceiling of our room. The room stunk terribly. There were holes all in the walls and they were patched with thin metal plates. My husband stepped on something and come to find out, it was an extention cord running underneath the carpet, from the out side to the air conditioner inside. We wedged two chairs next to the door because it would not shut properly. The shower head was about to fall out. We felt gross even after a bath. We slept fully dressed because I didn't want any of body parts touching the bed.",Bad
"We stayed at the Hyatt House because it was convenient to the EMP, as we were taking a vocal workshop. The room had greasy fingerprints all over the microwave, chairs around the bar were askew, and the shower was dirty with large spots of soap scum all over it.

I pulled back the covers on the bed to make sure the sheets had been changed and there was a plastic wrapper and a dirty wash rag. Needless to say, we went downstairs and said, please put us in another room. The next room was not very clean either, but better than the first one.kimbrleedo,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns.

"You just have to read some of the other reviews for this place to realize that there are some major shortcomings in its management. Clearly not indicative of the Westin brand. We made the mistake of not researching the hotel before making a parking reservation after Christmas. Cutting to the chase, our car was broken into in the garage while we were away (as was the car parked next door). We arrived back late at night to find plastic taped over the window and glass everywhere. The security guard at the hotel showed us a police report and told us that two suspects were arrested, gave us the name and number of the GM and sent us on our way. It is now March - our calls to the GM have never been returned - voicemail every time. 297 out of pocket for replacing the glass in the passenger window plus the cost of items stolen, but we don't have a copy of the police report to pass along to our insurance agent because the hotel management appear not to give two craps about a) what happens at this property, and b) basic customer service.

"The rate was good, but I'd have paid more for a room that did not have patio doors whistling wind through them and a TV and remote that worked properly. Planned power outage during an entire night was acceptable and hotel did decent job of giving out flashlights and glowsticks, but did not tell us hot water would off in the morning. Restaurant did not honor breakfast vouchers toward an off the menu option even though value of breakfast buffet was listed on coupon.

"Hi, my family and I were having a vacation at Walt Disney World so I decided to stay in Baymont Hotel only for it's photos that can be found online because there was a lot of hotels with the same price per night in the city. First, there was a misunderstanding of the people that made my reservation that were more focused in grabbing your money out of your pocket than helping and listening to the guest. They were pushing me so hard to reserve a room instantly that they did not hear when I said 2 nights. When I got to the hotel, The front desk agent helped me to get another night that wasn't in the reservation. The hotel was nothing to do with the online photos. The carpet was old, stained, dusty, and had bad odors the Lobby was dark. When I got to the room It was disappointed. The whole room stink, the carpet was all dirty and stained. The furniture old and scratched. Bathroom with hair in the floor, towels with holes. Beds were full size not queen. Pillows small and flat. Also I visited the pool which was dirty and with tree leafs in the bottom. I took breakfast in the morning it was small, No eggs, sausage, bacon, milk, only a basic breakfast. What I did like was the quietly of the room the friendly staff, nothing else. I will not come back again to this hotel, and I can not recommend it to anybody. Sorry, that's the very true.

"I've stayed at Days Inn's before in other cities and another location in Orlando, and although they are not the most luxurious hotel's around, they are adequate and easy places to stay - except this one!I just checked out this morning after being there 3 days. The main problem was with checking in. Several weeks before, I booked my stay on-line at their web site, choosing a pool-side room with 2 double-beds for a price I had to pre-pay for in advance. When I checked in, they gave me a room with 2 double-beds, but not pool-side. Instead they gave me a room on the top floor of their tower, which was literally the farthest room away from the front desk. When I said I reserved a pool-side room, I was told they didn't have any. When I showed them my reservation that I printed on my computer printer after I made the reservation on-line, the male clerk working that evening (the manager) said, That's not guaranteed. WHAT When I was making the reservation on-line, you are given about 12-15 different choices of rooms to choose from, depending on type and number of beds, amenities, etc. If a room isn't guaranteed, then why is a guest given all these choices to choose from Also, if the room is pre-paid for in advance, doesn't that lock in a guaranteeThis is just the first of all the domino's that began to fall when I was checking in. With my luggage, I walked up the 5 flight's of stairs to the room they gave me to find out the key wouldn't open the lock (magnetic key card). I walked back down first put my luggage back in the car before going back to the front desk telling them the key wouldn't open the door. They called for a Maintenance person to walk up with me to the room and he tried to open the door with his master key. It wouldn't unlock. He continued to try for about 3 minutes when it finally opened, then said to me There you go. But then I asked him if I go out tonight, I don't want to stand there for 3 minutes trying to open this door, at which he replied that he would be back in the morning to fix it. As he walked away, I entered the room and almost keeled-over from the smell in it. No kidding! It smelled as though someone had deficated human feces everywhere in the room. In addition, the lights were already on, the beds were unkept, and the TV was playing. I quickly ran out and yelled at the Maintenance guy to come back. When he entered the room, he looked surprised and went to the phone to apparently call the front-desk. At this point, I was livid! I stormed out of the room, ran down to the front desk, and in front of everyone in the lobby pointed at the male clerk behind the desk and sternly said, I want the pool-side room I reserved and I want it now! He yelled back We dont have any! I don't care for your attitude with me and I'll call the cops and have you thrown out for trespassing. Then you can sleep on the street tonight! At that, I said, Fine, and picked up my cell phone to call Days Inn's 800 number with the intention of getting someone of authority higher up than this guy to fix this situation. Possibly feeling threatened, the male clerk and a female clerk pulled out a large notebook and began looking frantically through it. When I reached a human voice on the Days Inn 800 line, the male clerk said he had a room on the 2nd floor with a king bed and asked if that would be OK with me. I told the person on the phone I may be calling back then hung up. I told the male clerk that I would look at it and let him know. He made up 2 keys, I went to look at the room, then returned to the front desk to tell him that it would be acceptable. After I settled into the room, I returned to the front desk and told the male clerk I was sorry for my outburst, but that I was within my right for it because of the problems that occured. I didn't catch every word the clerk said after that, but it sounded something like You don't know what's going on around here so there was no need to act like that, which told me there may be some sort of internal, political employee problems at this hotel - but that's still no excuse for the problems I enxcountered as a guest of this hotel.When I checked out this morning, the female clerk who took care of it asked me timidly Are you still mad at us She told me she was working the night I checked in and saw everything that happened. I answered her Yeah - a little bit, and she only said she hoped I would consider returning again sometime in the future. Maybe - if they gutted the place, did a complete remodeling job and hired all new, respondible hotel staff.",Bad
"Nice place to stay. It is at walking distance to SDSU, about 20 minutes, where you can take the trolley to downtown San Diego.The personal is very kind. The rooms are big and the place is quiet. Nearby you can find restaurants and shops.",Bad
"I would avoid this hotel. Bad customer service. I left a device in the TV to charge and it is now gone. I called the hotel after I returned home and explained the situation and they mentioned they would get back right in touch with me. NEver happened. I emailed the manager twice and no response. So I went through Hilton to try and get a response knowing full well that the device is gone. They could not get a response from the hotel either. I was credited the amount of my stay, but unfortunately my device was worth more. Miraculously I got a call from the hotel the day after Hilton tried to contact them and after a few exchanges they said what i already knew - they could not find it.We are committed to delivering outstanding service and what you described in your review was disheartening to all of us.

"Service, food and staff are the worse! What more can I say!!!The front desk staff was completely worthless, had no knowledge of any questions I asked! No bar as advertised!

Needless to say i have less than a perfect visit. I will not be returning to this hotel again.Thanks Vince, For your lack of customer service!!!!!!In behalf of the entire management and staff, I sincerely thank you for staying at the Hampton Inn Suites Atlanta Downtown and thank you for taking a moment to do our hotel survey.

"The room was a great size, updated and nice. The shower/tub was dirty, and the pool area was nasty, The kids wanted to swim ( which is why we booked this hotel... for its indoor pool) , but the pool was nasty and the hot tub had what looked like sand all in the bottom of it. The chlorine was so strong, we could not even stay.Dear 874reginab,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff and Housekeeping staff to ensure that it is not repeated. Cleanliness is our main priority so for you to experience this inconvenience while you stayed with us is unacceptable. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel.

Rude clerk at check in. After a long wait! Room had terrible smell. Room had no soap. Ov erall room very poor compared to other 5 star hotels. Long walk to parkinging. Unfortunately front desk experience along with smelly room makes this hotel a no stay,Bad
"I stayed at this hotel a month ago, and I got it on Hotels.com with a coupon. When I arrived, the night clerk was not too friendly, but was fast in completing the check-in process. The room was on the ground level, and had some noisy people walking past it throughout the night. On the good side, the bed and pillows were clean and comfortable, and the were plenty of lightning options in the room. I got a good night's rest. It also had a flat-screen TV, but I didn't watch it, so I can't comment on whether it worked or not. On the bad side, the shower did not have any hot water, and the sink faucet did not produce any water at all. So I had to take a cold shower and had to wash my hands, brush my teeth, etc. by turning on the water faucet in the bathtub and washing in my hands and moistening my toothbrush in the resulting flow of water. There were also none of the freebies you expect at a hotel, like toothpaste. Another downfall was that hard to step in and out of because the outer wall was high. I almost slipped when I got out of the shower.The morning clerk was friendly and completed the check-out process quickly. Overall, I would only stay here for a night at most. And ask for a room with running water in the sink and hot water in the shower.",Bad
"I booked a room here through a booking site. Apparently the price they gave was wrong and the manager made sure I understood that he was doing me the biggest favour in the world by letting me pay the quoted price: 'I could have cancelled it, you know', is what he said. He then gave me a room with a broken lock and no key, so every time I had to go out, I had to explain this all over again to whoever was at reception, and who would then go up VERY reluctantly to unlock the door for me. The people next door to me were a bunch of intimidating men watching sports on tv and shouting all night, and wrecking their room (from what I could see from the open door when I walked by there the next morning). Some of the furniture in my room was broken. The breakfast is not worth mentioning (dry bagels, bad coffee). The lady at reception the next morning was much nicer and helpful.",Bad
"I have written almost 150 reviews on Trip Advisor almost all of which were rated Very Good or Excellent. I am not a chronic complainer, but this is one of my rare negative reviews.I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Old Town for 2 nights on November 8th and 9th. My stay started out very positive, but ended on a negative note.First, the positives:Its a great location is the heart of Old Town San Diego. The hotel has a great restaurant on site Old Town Tequila Factory which I rated favorably. Dozens of other restaurants and shops are within a short walk.The Old Town Transit Center is also a few blocks away. There, you can hop on the Trolley to go to Downtown, Qualcomm Stadium and the Mission Valley shopping malls.The negatives:This location charges for parking -- 15 per day (10 for AAA members). This is also one of the few Best Westerns which doesnt offer a free breakfast (AAA members get a 25 discount off their breakfast buffet).My biggest complaint is that I didnt receive any housekeeping service on Monday. When I complained to the Front Desk on Tuesday, they made matters worse.I was traveling on vacation and wanted to sleep later on Monday morning, so I put out my Do Not Disturb sign. I removed the DND sign at 10am Monday when I left for the day. I returned to my room after the football game at 10:30pm to discover that my room was never cleaned.When I mentioned this Tuesday morning, the Front Desk clerk turned the problem around and basically said that it was MY fault that my room wasnt cleaned. I should have called Housekeeping to request service.I have worked in a hotel for 25 years, so I know thats not the way it works. If there is a DND on the door in the morning, Housekeeping returns after lunch to recheck the room. Clearly, this wasnt done.I am not the type of guest who expects a free stay for any minor problem, but I do think it would be appropriate to receive some compensation for my inconvenience of returning to a dirty room.The price I paid for the room includes the cost of providing housekeeping services. If the hotel fails to provide a promised service, they should not charge for it.I have requested that the hotel issue me a refund for the 20 parking fees which would be 10 discount off my total bill. I think that this would be fair and appropriate amount for returning to a dirty room.The Front Desk Manager has admitted that they made a mistake, but the hotel is refusing to issue a refund or any form of compensation for my inconvenience. In light of this poor customer service, I have given the hotel a Poor rating.Thank you for your feedback. As a result of your review, we have revisited our procedures in order to make the changes needed. I apologize for the housekeeping oversight. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if another stay in Old Town is on your agenda so that I can assign a team member to personalize your experience. Happy Holidays!",Bad
"We just stayed for 4 days as we were in town for a wedding. Great location but will say that the room smelled moldy, my shirts wrinkled from the humidity in the room.

"This is my first tripadvisor review and I feel I need to share my experience. The hotel and room is renovated and modern but we were assigned to an accessible room on first night which layout made us feel uncomfortable. They changed to a standard room for us next day but that room was not cleaned yet after we came back from the beach at 8pm and they wanted us to wait 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned because they did not have other room available. The guy (I forgot his name but he made me feel like lacks of experience) at front desk kept justifying it is their system issue (which means ok for customer). Even after room cleaned, we found hair on the bed and pillow smells and they only put 1 glass in our room. I choose Hyatt Centric because of their location, modern design and the quality of Hyatt (used to be), but this experience made me disappointed. Their staff definitely needs more training.Hi Brian C,Thank you for sharing your review of your stay with us in Waikiki. We apologize for the inconvenience with your room assignment.

"Hotel Diva tries to position itself as trendy and chic. In reality, it is way over-priced and of very poor quality: small, very noisy rooms cheap, broken furniture terrible TV reception erratic water temperature in the shower. Only positives were good check in and check out.I stayed in room 620, facing Geary Street, on 6th of 7 floors. The traffic noise was absolutely horrendous and deafening. Also, there was a door to an adjoining room that looked of normal thickness but must be hollow as I could hear every word that the people in the next room said or watched on TV. Also, whenever the HVAC unit came on I had to adjust the TV volume, probably more due to the smallness of the room than anything else. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the hotel provides you with ear plugs along with your shampoo, etc. You will not be able to sleep without the ear plugs.The bathroom is slightly bigger than a closet, with no room or shelves to put your stuff. I took a shower at 5am and the water temperature constantly fluctuated between hot and cold.The furniture is uncomfortable and cheap- the chair for the desk was broken and is not suitable for working.The TV reception is awful - very grainy and only analog. No digital. You do get free wi-fi. Wow.Stay away from this place. I went there via the secret hotel option on Travelocity - the hotel calls itself 3 1/2 stars. It's far from that.Dear Patrick H,Thank you for sharing your comments with Trip Advisor. Please accept my sincere apology for the inconvenience you experienced during your recent stay with us. I always encourage my guests to communicate to myself and my staff any concerns they may have during their stay. This way, we are able to accommodate our guests the best way possible and that they will have a pleasant stay with us.

"My husband booked our hotel stay here through Priceline.com. I called a week before our travel date to request a King Non-Smoking Room. The front desk receptionist informed me that the room was already booked for a King Non-Smoking. I informed them that I had spoken with someone earlier and was promised the King room. She wanted to know with whom I spoke. I did not take the young ladies name. Where I come from when someone tells you they will do something they are suppose to do it! They had given away our room and we had to settle for Queen Non-Smoking. They had no explanation or common courtesy to offer for their mistake. This hotel was absolutely Filthy. It smelled terrible. Every corridor reeked of air freshener trying to cover up the unpleasant odors. They do not maintain anything. The lobby, corridor, and elevator was so bad that I actually dreaded going into the room. Every inch of floor was covered with something that needed swept, mopped, or vacuumed. The room ceiling had huge water stains, curtains had some huge black mystery stain on them. The carpet was sticky. The bathroom floor was slippery with God only knows what. The room did not smell fresh at all. The fabric furniture had huge stains all over it. It was so bad I was afraid to put my clothes or belongings anywhere. I ended up removing the comforter and laying it over the sofa so we could put our things down. I did not remove my socks in the room my entire stay. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The bedding was old, tabby, and scratchy. The pillows were like rough paper. The kitchen was dirty the sink had gunk in the bottom. Floors were not swept well. The A/C unit was so loud it was like a piece of machinery was in the room with us. The person above us stomped their floor all night. You can hear everything through the walls inside. You can also hear everything from the outside of the hotel as well. Very old building that needs an absolute demolition and remodel inside. I have stayed in many hotels in my time, but this one was absolutely disgusting. Then the next morning when we were ready to get the heck outta there the front lobby attendant informed my husband that he needed to pay more for the room. She refused to check us out until my husband paid her. She claimed we had been put in the wrong room. Yes thanks to them we had! Because they gave away our room! We had already paid for our room through priceline. The transaction was complete. She wanted my husband to give her a receipt from the previous afternoon when we checked in. They didn't give us anything at that time. She wanted to know who checked us in so she could scold them. Guess what SHE DID! She would not look at the booking in her system and flat out accused my husband of lying about the fact that he paid through priceline. She told him she couldn't take his word for it. Okay fine, then look into your own computer system the information is there! He had to call me inside from our car and I literally had to pull up the priceline information that she refused to look for herself on her computer from my phone. She was trying to charge us 99.00 dollars inclusive of tax for a room we had already paid for. She still argued with my husband and refused to speak to him directly. She kept yelling the same thing asking who checked us in. Again SHE DID! She was the rudest front desk attendant I have ever dealt with. Finally after she was satisfied with the receipt on my phone, she still held us there so she could call their own help line to fix the problem. She finally let us go and never gave us our receipt from them. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I don't suggest you do either.",Bad
"First off, even with my credit card number, they would not hold the room past 8 PM!

"I have been in multiple Days Inn properties and I like them. This one is not among them. I picked this one as of proximity of my meeting location - I now wish I should have choose something else.Confusing floor plan spread across 2 different buildings. Hanging stuff in bathroom, you cant understand weather you have open or shut a tap. Either you get too cold water or too hot water. No breakfast at all - there is buffet you can pay but that is just OK. Inconsistent WiFi and bad room lightning. Staff are good - but they are overloaded. Hence very little time for checking with you.",Bad
"Unfortunately was a somewhat terrible stay. Right from the get go was warned that the systems were down and would have them up again soon. Was told about other amenities and directed to the room. Come to find out walking by the pool that that was out of order as well. With no wifi since their systems were down I headed to the bar and got a bite a drink. I think everyone was there since no one could get wifi or go to the pool and everyone charging their rooms. The next day at our tradeshow event the wifi was still in and out and their systems were still down. Overall pretty disappointing experience with all of the amenities unavailable. Hopefully they figure it out!Thank you for your feedback, and we apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. Unfortunately, Marriott did have a system outage caused by the hurricane that affected several hundred properties during your stay.

However, if you are a normal human being and expect clean sheets, and not pubes stuck to walls and absolutley filthy carpet that trust me you can SMELL has NEVER BEEN CLEANED..and just a HORRID room full of bed bugs, then you will not want to stay here. Dont spend your money here. The people running this place would NEVER pass a health inspection..absolutley never. And i will be complaining. Because since I have been back I have had rashes all over my body. I just cant believe that people can get away with a place like this.try other hostels, we saw other nice ones whilst there. The bathrooms have full hairs in sink, and half eaten food everywhere..it was just a nightmare. ANY place should at least have clean sheets and not sheets filled with stains, and all different old sheets that had never been washed. A complete disguiting example of a hostel. Apalled. Oh and if you see good reviews..TRUST me its because the writers are proably backpackers (that are prob 16 and have never left home) and were absiolutley drunk and looking to party and they stayed here because they got free beer. BIG excitement..beer is like 5 bucks..go buy some and stay somwhere descent. Thats all",Bad
"Same hotel, same great location, same great bed and incredibly comfortable pillows. So how can the review of my second stay here drop down to one star after previously according this hotel five stars on my other visit Easy, room service, or better stated, lack thereof. We were there for three nights. On our second day, we headed out early and knowing we were going to be gone for at least several hours, we thought it would be an opportune time for them to clean our room and make the bed. Upon our return and to our dismay, the room had not yet been made up. But we figured, no biggie, they can do so once we head out to dinner. And they did indeed do the job. The next day, the same thing. We headed out for a few hours and asked them to once again make up the room while we were out. We even gently reminded housekeeping of what happened the previous day, and they assured us the room would be done by the time we returned. Well, once again, when we returned, nothing had been done. Not being too happy, we spoke with the housekeeping supervisor and explained the situation. She apologized and said they'd get right on it, so we headed out to have some fun (always something to do in this town). But yet again, after we returned, the room still was unmade. We went downstairs and firmly, but nicely complained to the desk clerk about our situation. She said that someone would be sent up promptly, so we headed to a bar and killed about an hour and a half. Upon returning, almost incredibly so, the room was still not made up. By now we were extremely frustrated, so I called down and asked to speak with the on-site manager. I explained everything to him, expressing our frustration and feeling that our requests were blatantly disregarded. He assured me that the room would be cleaned immediately and even deducted 100 off our bill. Well, the room was finally cleaned and yes, our bill was reduced by 100, but the bad taste hasn't left my mouth. This was horrible customer service and be rest assured we will not stay here again.Thank you simiseeu for taking the time to provide your feedback on your recent stay with us.

"We arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. We were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. We took the shuttle to Pike Place Market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. It still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. We were thrilled with our view of EMP, Space Needle and Chihuly Garden. We had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. We slept 6 fairly comfortably. Twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. In the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. We almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. After dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. They tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. They finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. Sure enough - standard practice. When we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being SO tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. There was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. Very frustrating! On the plus side - breakfast was very good. This place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a Hyatt.Dear JenH,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hyatt house Seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. We will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. Also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. The issues you experience will be addressed.

"Days Inn Orlando Fl 5858 international dive by Wet N Wild, 7-11, and Red Lobster.Would pick a better Hotel next time. For starters they advertise to give shuttles to the parks however that shuttle service is one drop off time and a few pick up times. We were going to Universal Studio which opens at 10 but the shuttle doesnt leave until 10:45. The park closes at 8 but the shuttle picks up at 7:15 and 10:15. However Universal studios is in walking distance, so we choice to walk. It took us about 20 minutes to walk along with a wheelchair, so many may be able to walk faster. Also the shuttle require a 24 hour notice for wheelchairs. So since we didnt know exactly when we would need them ahead of time we were not able to use their shuttle.We started in room 275. We let the front desk know that we needed a fridge, as we have meds that have to be kept cold, and they did get us a fridge. The fridge does keep things cold but doesnt seal on top. You can put your finger right into the fridge. So we put a towel on top to help keep things out and the fridge cold. Fridges and Microwaves are available for an extra 10 charge. However, the next day, we found some uninvited bugs in our room. Not the end of world but I really am bug-a-phobic. I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to spray while we were out. When we got back they had the fan on in the bathroom and we didnt see anything.. But the next morning we I had to turn the light on for the bathroom we found more. We quickly got dress as we kept finding more and my husband went to speak the manager. We were asked to wait a half hour for the manager to come in. Half hour later, the manager was in a meeting so my husband told the front desk lady the issues. They called in a contractor to spray and moved us to room 105. The new room was much bigger and nicer looking. Plus it had a table and two chairs which was not in the other room.The door to room 275 didnt really seal at all. You could see the light from outside and pizza places where putting ads/coupons in the door frames. The ads would come right through the right side of the door and fall to floor a few feet in. In room 105 the door sealed better but there were people outside smoking and talking and you could totally hear them plus smell their smoking in the room. At least the ads got stuck in the door. Everything went ok after that except for toilet overflowing once. My husband quickly shut off the water to the toilet and we put down towels on the floor. I called the front desk and a lady came down to our room and asked what was wrong, although I explained it over the phone. They sent down the maintenance guy who just fixed the toilet. My husband asked if it was going to get cleaned up and we were told yes but that is housekeepings job. 15 minutes later we recalled the front desk and asked if someone was going to clean up the mess and bring us new towels. We had used towel to clean up the water. Housekeeping was around shortly after to cleanup and put in new towels. Other issue with the room beside it being run down was hearing everything that was going on outside.The hotel does not have a continental breakfast but they told us there is a Deli but we just went to Wal-Mart for quick breakfast foods. There is also 7-11 two spots down and Dennys and I-Hop are across the street.The interest is also issues at this hotel. There is Wi-Fi here but often the internet will not work. I know the issue is not my computer as my laptop is running just fine. I took the downtime to do extra maintenance work and write start to write this review.Our children did try the pool but shortly came back because they said it was cold and not that clean.. However it was a windy day so that may be why. Over all about a two star hotel which does have some issues but they are in the perfect location with Wet n Wild being about a block, Universal Studios in walking distance, and the I-trolley stop for SeaWorld and anything else on international drive as one the trolley I-ride stop is just across the street. For me I would rather stay at one of the nicer hotels, which seem to be closer to SeaWorld as the ones on the south side of International Drive look a bit older and run down.",Bad

"Stayed in December . Location is good close to french quarter and aquarium etc. Front desk staff friendly . Room was not good the bathroom was old and poorly maintained, water pressure very bad and shower not that hot, power points came away from the wall when removing dryer etc. The floor above us was very noisy and we could hear footsteps all night , very loud. Room included croissants for breakfast that we're okay but coffee was only warm . Our room also had a safe that didn't work which is a huge pain. We had to drop valuables at the front desk ever time we went out... The phone in our room also continuously flashed a red message light which is actually quite bright at night... We were told it was faulty ( like the safe) . We would think there are better hotels available. We went to bourbon st on Christmas night and found it to be fine .... Pretty quiet but we left by 9 , so can't comment on excessive drinkers etc. it was quiet for obvious reasons. Also went to the aquarium which was worth the visit.Dear Mooseygoosey,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at St. James Hotel, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member.Allow me to apologize on behalf of our hotel for failing to meet your expectations regarding the maintenance of your room on your recent visit. I have shared your feedback with our Chief Engineer to ensure we handle that these problems are taken care of swiftly. Again, thank you for your time and valuable feedback. We sincerely appreciate it and hope you will give us another chance to provide you with superior service and accommodations on your next visit to New Orleans.Kind Regards",Bad
"The plus of this place is doubtless the location: in front of Disney parks entrance, just on the other side of the road!!Concerning the structure itself, interaction with the staff has been surely positive, all the people we met were really nice with us, but this is where positive aspects unfortunately stops...Rooms are old (bed creak, shower difficult to run) and unless you turn ac at max also really hot. The structure is also very noisy too: you can clearly hear people in the other rooms or, worse pulling their luggage on the gallery outside..",Bad
"My family and I checked in on Thursday 9/21 around 9pm. The parking lot was very small and hard to get a spot. When we finally got in the lobby, it looked clean and presentable. Our room was an entirely different story. It was facing outside by the pool. The light was already on in our room before we entered. Once we got in I was immediately disgusted. It smelled horrible (almost like a really bad sulfur), room looked very outdated and unappealing. Room was small, beds were old and I was so grossed out. I went to the front desk and explained how disappointed I was and they let me look at a few other rooms they offered--all of them terrible. We stayed put as there was no sense in moving to another awful room and quickly went to bed. When I woke up the next morning there were TWO cockroaches in the bathroom. YUCK! Southern California, I get it, bugs can happen. Every other hotel we stayed at for the rest of the week was so lovely. Very clean, up to date, and well kept. We had a few other family members that stayed in different rooms at this hotel and they were all equally displeased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. It ran me 135 after 12 for parking. We had 3 more rooms reserved at this hotel again for that Sunday but we canceled them immediately. Gross, outdated, smelly, and OVERPRICED. Never again will I stay at this hotel! BUYER BEWARE. Also, when I checked out of the hotel, the man at the desk asked me how everything was. I told him You don't want to know and the didn't have any response...not a sorry, to hear that, nothing..Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations.

"The building is well located next to Union Square in San Francisco, 2 steps from Cable Car station. a Theatre occupies the first floors of the building.At the reception the staff is very standard, nothing more.Room I was given (and I was upgraded on last floor) is so old that no other word come to my mind than dirty. No Air conditioner, a fan is at your disposal on the ceiling, above the bed, and you can open the window.Bathroom is small, and especially needs to be renovated.For the same price you can leave in a much better Hotel in San Francisco.Dear Matthieu L,Thank you very much for taking your time to share your comment with us on TripAdvisor. I am so sorry to hear our hotel didn't meet your expectation. Our hotel offers different style of rooms and I wish we could offer you a different room if we have known this during your stay with us. Our hotel just recently updated all the guest rooms furniture such headboard, dressers, night stands and mini fridges. All the guest's floor hallway carpets are renewed and as well as lobby furniture. We are going to renew the guest's room carpet very soon, and also working on minor renovation in each guest's room. I hope you would give us a second chance for your next visit in San Francisco. Thank you again for staying with us.",Bad

"My husband and I stayed at Estancia over the Thanksgiving weekend. Thank goodness for our Thanksgiving dinner at Torrey Pines (where we'll be staying next time), or the weekend would have been a complete loss.Noise: The builders sure made a lot of money on this one, because the walls must be made of cardboard. You can hear your neighbors above and on the sides, you can hear everyone in the hallway (even when not directly outside your door), and you can hear TVs, heating and a/c from all adjoining rooms as they rumble through your room and ripple through your ceiling and walls. If you must stay here, insist on a top floor room (3rd Floor, I believe) to minimize overhead noise.Room Size: Hardly the square footage promoted (300 sq ft). You practically bang your knees on the armoire (TV set holder) as you pass by the foot of the bed. The hallway is a total waste, and the patio is a joke.Room Furnishings: There was a huge stain on the lampshade there was no lamp or light provided in the area of the suitcase dolly, so you rummaged in your bag in the dark. The TV was so very small and made a huge buzzing sound if it was muted. No regular blankets were provided, just sweat making, hot acrylic ones. Only 3 towels and 3 pillows were provided for 2 people. The bathroom light could only be turned on with the fan, which was so loud (I mean really loud) that a relaxing bath was impossible unless you wanted to bathe in the dark.Dining: In the restaurant, we asked what time dinner was served. We were told half an hour. In the bar, we ordered a drink in the bar. It never arrived. We went back to the restaurant half an hour later. We were told dinner wasn't being served for another half hour. Having already been given incorrect information once, we checked with a third restaurant employee who told us that dinner was not for another hour. Two wrong answers and an undelivered drink - that's how we ended up at the Lodge at Torrey Pines.Pool/Jacuzzi: The area was a mess, there were no towels, and there was no one from whom to get towels.Just Plain Tacky: The 17 parking charge, the 9 Hospitality Fee.Save your money for any other resort or hotel. There are tons of good ones in San Diego this is definitely not one of them. (P.S. - Sorry for the lag time between staying and reviewing. We moved, and I just unpacked my two pages of notes on our vacation.)",Bad

"This was the third year we have stayed at this particular hotel while attending an event for my daughter. The previous two years were enjoyable stays. This year was terrible. The television and internet did not work most of the weekend. Went down to breakfast and was told there was no juice because they were not prepared for the number of guests. The lobby, walkway in front of the elevators, and dining area were torn up the entire weekend. I am shocked that renovations would be planned during a busy weekend. So very disappointed! Got a great rate, but I guess you get what you pay for.Dear S6674SGamandac,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff to ensure that it is not repeated. The condition of internet and television was unacceptable, but because of your feedback we did take care of both situations. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel.

"Hotel was only worth the 50 that we paid through Priceline. The agent that checked us in was rude and didn't want to be bothered. We were in town for the USC/ Alabama game and flew in early Saturday, due to our schedules. We arrived at the hotel at 9am, requested early check in, the agent didn't even look down and said Check in wasn't till 3p I asked if we were able to get an early check in to the reply we can try for 2p at the earliest she didn't even look down at the computer to see if a room was available. After asking if anything was open now, she was able to find an available room. I have worked in hotels for 10 years, and know that rooms are open if you don't sell out the night before which they didn't. Since our flight was early that morning we decided to rest before heading to the stadium, only to be woken by the housekeeper wanting to inspect the room. Hotel in general is dark and gloomy, halls feel cold and hotel looks like a bad 80s hotel. Watch out for platform bed edges at night, I have a huge bruise due to running into the corner when getting up in the middle of the night. Do yourself a favor and pass up this hotel and spend the money on something nicer.Thank you for your most recent stay. We take great pride providing the highest level of service, guest safety and cleanliness. As you know from working in hotels, we can never guarantee an early check in but will do our best in our attempts to make accommodations for guests wanting to check in early. With that in mind, while we may not have sold every room the night before, reservations are often made for specific room types for a reason and we may have not had your specific room type available at such an early hour as checkout is not until 12 PM. We were indeed sold out for the weekend of the game and our team did their best to get the rooms turned as quickly as possible. Hopefully we will see you again for the next game.",Bad

"I understand that it is quite likely a great improvement over years past, however the refresh is superficial only. The floors still creak and were bowed and the climate control is minimal. The provided window air conditioner has not been serviced in some time and the air was not cool. I'm also concerned that the shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are not properly secured. I feel like someone had contaminated the shampoo, as it had a terrible smell, which unfortunately I did not discover until after I had it in my hair. The attached restaurant is well above average for the area and is the only redeeming quality in my opinion. The restaurant hours could be improved for in-house guestsHello fastboxter, please accept my sincere apology if we failed your standards during your stay.

"I booked at hotels.com for a quick overnight trip for our nephew's graduation. The inn touted itself as a European boutique hotel, but it's really a step up from a hostel. Bare bones. We paid half the fee charged on their website for a double room. Double means just that: double beds. When I called to confirm the day before our trip, I got no answer, so I emailed. The reply from the front desk staff was condescending and rude, and immediately I regretted booking at the Highland Inn. I then discovered that others have complained (if you want link, let me know). It was too late to cancel, so I arrived with trepidation. The room was spartan, the shower was awful, the a/c window units were not very effective, the carpet was old, the fridge was banged up, and the breakfast was paltry. However, the neighborhood was cute (my local relative said it was not that good but I couldn't tell from our brief stay) and it's close to historic midtown (2 miles). The management never contacted me re the rude reception, and my final recommendation is to go somewhere else.Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We take all feedback seriously, and sincerely regret that you did not have a positive experience with us. Currently, we are replacing the window units throughout the hotel with individual heating/cooling units, however, if your unit was not working efficiently we would have been happy to move you and the same goes for the shower. Any time you are not happy with anything during your stay, we are more than happy to help. Upon further investigation, I am having trouble locating the email you spoke of, and it certainly is not in keeping with how we treat our guests. We urge you to contact us directly to discuss. We strive to make our guests stay the best it can be and would be more than happy to address this situation with our staff. Thank you,Kristin Anderson",Bad

"I stayed one night recently in the annex. Sounds like the luxe part of the hotel overlooking the coast is a better bet. Being unfamiliar with the hotel, I was not aware of this. The annex is like a motel. The room was dingy and in need of a good cleaning and some fresh paint. Overall, it just made me feel itchy. The kid at the front desk was a bit snarky, but efficient. Otherwise, valet was fine and I didn't interact much with any other staff to offer comment. I stayed in a suite the Borgata the night before, so admittedly most AC options would've been a letdown. In hindsight I wish I would've just ponied up the money and stayed the Borgata another night. My bad, I guess.",Bad
"This hotel is horrible for so many reasons that I don't even know where to begin. The location is on a very busy street called Orange Blossom Trail. When we arrived, we needed to make a left turn in order to get to the parking lot of the Hotel. Making that left turn seemed nearly impossible and very dangerous! The traffic on Orange Blossom makes getting in and out of the parking lot seemingly impossible and we almost had an accident! We checked into room 284...on the 2nd floor and had tons of luggage because we were in town for a Fashion Show. Low and behold, the hotel has NO elevators! What!! How do you operate a hotel that has a second floor with no elevators The guy at the front desk almost laughed out loud when he told us there were no elevators...not because it was funny but because he too, thought it was ridiculous! We had to lug heavy bags up the stairs only to get there and find that the room was horrible. There was a musty moisture in the air as soon as we walked in and the room felt very stale and unclean. The walls had been caulked to fill in several holes and I do mean SEVERAL HOLES but they didn't even attempt to match the paint. The wall was painted yellow but the caulked portion was painted over with orange. The sheets and comforters on both beds had yellow stains and brown stains all over. The carpet was stained, possibly with urine because it smelled heavy with urine near the stain. The bathroom looked very old and cheaply constructed with peeling paint and stained walls. The hotel was pet friendly but I don't think they spray regularly for fleas because we all had flea bites after only being in the room for a few hours. The halls smelled really bad and especially in the stairwells. One huge thing that stood out was that there were several young women, dressed very scantily, walking up and down the street in the area near the hotel in the late evenings. I do believe there was heavy prostitution in the area and this hotel and other hotels in the area are used for that purpose. We decided that we could not sleep comfortably in this hotel and checked out the same night. The weekend that we were in town was a busy weekend due to the All Star event so most hotels were booked solid. We searched and searched and found a hotel with only one room left! We booked it, packed up and high tailed it out of there! Ended up approximately 2 miles away at a Hampton Inn Suites where we re-showered, and slept comfortably in clean beds! Never again will I stay at a Baymont! We booked here for two reason...because the group we were in town for had blocked several hotels for their fashion show and this was one of them and number two, because most hotels in the area were already sold out. I will never stay at a Baymont EVER again!",Bad
We were price gouged on a Saturday night paying over 300 for a one night stay here which wouldn't have been so bad if the room was decent. The hotel staff were terribly unfriendly. We were made to feel as if we were inconveniencing them so we didn't even bother to complain. Our room had it's bathroom window TAPED onto the window frame. Cold air leaked in all night. I would never recommend this place to anyone.,Bad

"First impressions last forever. This was my first time staying at a Marriott hotel. I booked our room months in advance of our arrival date. Arrived at 4:10 p.m. and room was not ready. Took 3 people to confirm the room was NOT ready. Spent 12 mins waiting to get a room. No upgrade was offered or same style room we originally booked was offered. Was given a standard room with a 30.00 discount. The room was OK, however the beds were very small for double occupancy and way too high off the floor! No complementary Internet or coffee was offered. No free breakfast either. Do yourself a favor and book at a Hilton/Hampton hotel. You will get more amenities for a lot less .

Less than two weeks before our arrival date an email notification came to advise us the pool would be closed for maintenance for the majority of our stay! Now I am aware that this is necessary, however in all of my past experiences any type of scheduled maintenance is clearly disclosed well in advance. Upon a call to the hotel's manager to discuss this concern, no apology or compensation was offered, and she even encouraged us to look into other hotel options! With less than two weeks to go entering a busy season, clearly most hotels are already booked.

"We found this hotel online with a discount coupon. Checked out the website and everything looked great...it boasts free shuttle service to Disneyland and Knotts and that it is a mile and a half away from Disneyland. Try about 5 miles. Took forever to find it. It was in this wierd, old part of town, off the beaten path, right on the main drag of Brookhurst street. Outside appearance was a little icky. It had an unattractive closed down restaurant as part of the hotel and an old shuttle that was sitting in the front. To our dismay, there were no longer any shuttle services offered. The rooms were old and a little bit dingy. You can hear people in the other rooms taking showers. The beds were not at all comfortable. TV got only a few stations. Definately not what we expected. We thought it was going to be a classy hotel by Disneyland. We felt slightly misled by the website. The perks The rooms had a microwave and little refridgerator. The pool was nice and secluded, very quiet and clean. My nephew and I swam for 2 hours, all alone! We were the only ones out there, it was great! Friendly staff, willing to help. Overall, this wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I will be much more diligent in the future when I do research for hotels.",Bad

"I stayed at this hotel for business when I had to work late one night and needed to stay in the city. I chose this hotel because my company had just had their quarterly meeting here and I thought it was very nice. Check in was easy and everyone was very friendly. I love the dcor. Upon check in I was given a 10 bar card to use either at the bar or from the mini bar. I ordered a salad to go and took it to my room to eat. The room is decorated so cute. I loved it. I had the queen room and it is very small. It was fine for me but might be a bit tight if you had another person. I chose a drink from the mini bar to use my free 10. The next morning I filled out my free drink card and even took down my list of bar items as it said to do upon check to make sure I was credited for the correct item. I was asked if I wanted to use the other part of my 10.00 towards my salad and I said sure, I guess. No problem...finished my check out and headed to work. Today I check my bank account and I have two charges...one for the original amount including the hold, and another for the amount I actually paid when I checked out. When I called and asked why I was charged twice, they said well...instead of refunding you the 3.00 on the salad they did a full refund and full charge. Well guess what, this doesn't work well.....I now have two hotel charges and no refunds, as it takes several days before the refund hits your bank. I could have cared less about the 3.00, especially had I known how much of my bank account it would eat up. Luckily I had it in the bank, but I need it...I don't have a ton of extra money to just tie up an extra 172.00 for a 3.00 refund. I think this is a horrible practice and I certainly should have been told about it upfront. I am not sure if I will stay here again, I do not like to have my money messed with. :( Very disappointed.Ouch! This makes me upset to read. I'm sorry that a great experience turned out to be a disappointment. Can you please reach out to me via email at rachel.rodriguezallegrochicago.com so I can review your bill and make sure everything is taken care of the right way and make things right. I look forward to hearing from you.Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager",Bad
"We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.Ms. Sara Z , Let me start this response by apologizing to both of you in regards to the overall experience you had at our hotel, as we can see we failed to meet your basic guest needs. Our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests on Friday Saturday, we failed to provide you with personalized service and attention during your arrival and throughout. We are happy to hear that the upgraded accommodations to our Urban suite was up to your standards. Also regarding the gift bag and wine, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 30 gift bags per day and we have not had this situation happened before, we update our wines every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of the wine during your visit, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience. I am sorry we missed you during your checkout, as our Manager on Duty was available and expecting you. We hope that you would provide us the opportunity to further discuss the details of your stay you can contact me directly at 415.392.8800. We look forward to your response. Thank you again for your time and honest feedback. Have a great weekend!EJ Varela Hotel Manager",Bad
So this place is filthy and gross......not to mention the needle that was found in my room....when management was informed they said they would remove it.....I asked for my money back and was denied anything...I told them I have pictures and video of this needle that I will post online...they said go ahead and call the police while I was...

"Best Western should remove their affliation with this location. Room was so small, it was difficult to move around. In order to get past the bed and the wall at the end of the bed with your luggage, you literally had to walk side ways to get by. You had to shut the bathroom door to use the toilet or shower. I have a one car garage that was bigger than this room. And the room was NOT cheap!! Absolutely terrible!! Advice - find another location.",Bad
"I was really disappointed. Upon checking in, we were told our reservation had cancelled . I hadn't cancelled it. Instead of a 2 bedroom, we got downgraded to a studio. We were traveling with 3 small children, including a baby who does not sleep well. The front desk also had the wrong credit card on file.",Bad
"Chose this location because of event attending. Had good experiences with Hampton in the past at other locations. This was not a good experience. No hot water, boiled eggs tasted like onions. Staff polite and very nice. Compensated for no hot water in rate reduction. Not worth the higher price rate for a night's stay.",Bad
"For starters, the reception staff treats the guestsas a potential thief...

"Great are to walk for shopping and food. Price is reason and under 150 which is my work budget. One visit I walk up to a palmetto bug on my sink. I called the desk and they sent security to kill it.

"I had booked at this hotel for 2 nights. I arrived to check in and was told that there was no reservation in my name (even though I had the confirmation number showing the reservation) and that the hotel was fully booked . The clerk tried blaming it on the booking company and then told me I should have booked through the hotel directly and that it was my fault for using a booking company. However I'm prerty sure the hotel jusy over booked on purpose. She didn't offer me any help at all so my 3 kids and I were stranded in an unfamiliar town with no where to go and a dying cell phone. She didn't offer any apology nor did she offer to call other hotels to help us find a room or offer any kind of information about where to go. Worst customer service ever. Stupidly small parking lot (that does not look safe at all). I would avoid this hotel!!!! We ended up going to a hotel close to this one (Pacific View Inn.....NOT to be confused with the Pacific Shores Inn)....even though that hotel was full too, the man working there took the time to help me out and made some great suggestions. I do apologize for the mistake of my hotel and your reservation. I will stress the importance of taking care of every person, whether a guest or not. I will use these comments in my next training meeting. Thank you for letting me know about your experience.",Bad

We paid for a cheap room and we got it. The place seemed kind of sketchy. Had my husband not had a concealed license and been carrying his gun we probably wouldn't of stayed here.

"I hope this is a warning to others. I was planning to attend a convention in September in Atlanta, GA. I booked at this hotel in February earlier this year. 3 days before I was to leave for the convention, the hotel emailed me stating they could not honor my reservations, but had moved me to another of their chain hotels some miles away. This was unacceptable due to the convention being in this hotel. I called and talked to management and was told that YES, we did purposely overbook the hotel, and that YES this is Marriott company policy. I was also told I would receive a call from the hotel manager the next day. This did not happen, nor would the initial front end manager answer her phone or return any voice mails. BEWARE, a confirmation number with Marriott means nothing. I am appreciative of the early warning however, as I was able to completely cancel the trip and cut at least some of my expense losses.",Bad

"There were more cons than pros for the 4 nights that my family stayed here. 14 people were on this trip and we rented 3 rooms. Unfortunately, the room that i ended up with had many problems. All 3 rooms were non-smoking room, but right when i walked into the room, you can smell the aroma of cigarettes. The second problem faced was the dysfunctional microwave in the room. We called the front desk to come fix it for us, they were nice enough to come see what was wrong with it and come fix it however, i don't know what they fixed because the microwave did not heat up the food at all. The third, but biggest, problem was the BED BUGS! Even though they might say their hotel is bug free, we faced these little pests late at night. My son was bitten many times(pictures included) and I was bit once on my eyebrow on the last night. Luckily, we caught one bug that was still moving around in the morning and showed them to the front desk. We asked for a discount because all the nights we stayed there were met with discomfort however the best they did for us was a discount for one night. We called the manager and explained our situations after our stay and he wasn't much of a help either.Thank you for expressing your concerns in regards to your recent experience at the Best Western Miramar. The concerns you have raised are very understandable given what you described, and I appreciate the opportunity to look into it and respond.The global resurgence of bed bugs over the last five years is a widely-recognized problem. It is suspected that this resurgence is a direct result of increased international travel to and from the United States, since bed bugs are easily transported in suitcases, clothing, and purses among other things. To address this growing problems, we have a continuous pest control policy in place at our property and have implemented a thorough training program for our housekeeping and maintenance personnel to assist in the early recognition of infestation.Our certified pest control vendor has visited the property and assures us that there is no current infestation on property. Given the nature of our business, it is our expressed commitment to make sure every guest experience an enjoyable one. Your comfort and satisfaction are very important to us, as you have had a chance to see. We appreciate you taking your time to stay with and write review.

"We arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. We were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. We took the shuttle to Pike Place Market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. It still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. We were thrilled with our view of EMP, Space Needle and Chihuly Garden. We had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. We slept 6 fairly comfortably. Twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. In the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. We almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. After dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. They tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. They finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. Sure enough - standard practice. When we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being SO tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. There was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. Very frustrating! On the plus side - breakfast was very good. This place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a Hyatt.Dear JenH,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hyatt house Seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. We will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. Also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. The issues you experience will be addressed. Again I apologize that your stay did not go smoothly as it should have. I hope that you will give us another opportunity the next time you are in town and feel free to contact me directly so I can assist with your next stay personally. Sincerely,Jonathan",Bad

"Arrived after a long trip. Got to the hotel after 11pm and discovered that even though I had a guaranteed reservation, there was no room waiting for me because they had overbooked the hotel. They walked me to a Fairfield hotel about 8 miles away (great staff but a tad nasty and very worn hotel). I wasn't the only one walked. At least four or five other people had the same experience I did at the same time (and according to the Fairfield clerk--a lot of people have this happen). Maybe this was a lucky break. When I took the Fairfield van back to the Marriott in the early morning for a meeting I had there I discovered, according to one guest, that he had experiencced strange bugs (bedbugs) in his room that night.....so perhaps a golden lining.",Bad
"we arrived at 11 am with confirmation from our booking agent that clearly states an early check in at 9.30am. there was no room for us, but the receptionist did say she would get a cleaner on to a room straight away. we looked around for a seat, there was a sofa that had stains all over it, we choose a table with cereals and other crumbs on it, it was the best table available in there. after an hour of waiting the receptionist lunch was delivered by a local takeaway, which she ate and had a soda to wash it down after 2 hours of waiting and no refreshments offered we were told our room was ready. it was a room that I had seen the cleaner clean when we first arrived, she had cleaned two more since that room but we were kept waiting. it was a strange room, your bathroom had a shower and toilet the sink was in the kitchen area which double up as a kitchen sink. the next day we went to checkout and the same receptionist was working, I went to hand in my key but was kept waiting while she was putting polish on her finger nails, while we waited for her, we spoke to another couple who were sat on the same table we sat the day before, they also had confirmation for an early check in but no room was ready. finally all the receptionist nails were done and she took our key . there was no goodbye, thank you, how was your stay.....nothing. we would not recommend this hotel to anyone. we have even told our travel agent how bad it was and they have said that they just went by the Ramada name brand.....well we wont be staying at that hotel next time we visit san diegoComments from our guests are extremely appreciated as they allow us to better understand how we can improve our accommodations.

"Downtown hotel that was hard to find as entrance/parking garage is around the corner from the actual address. The sign out front is very small. Overnight parking is exhorbitant we used a garage 5 blocks away, although there are others closer by. Room was interesting L shape with view over street. Furnishings were all fine although 2 lightbulbs were burnt out. Staff was helpful, but busy. Pub next door is half the price (or less) than hotel restaurant. I noticed traffic noise, especially truck honking early in morning and siren that went by. Not a poor hotel, just not my style for visiting a city and making everything convenient.We appreciate the feedback jerryg, to make your next Seattle visit as convenient as possible I would be happy to connect you to our W Insider who can assist with local arrangements.

"I stayed here for two nights booked through FHR. The room itself was fine, but the front desk and check-in experience undermined the entire stay. I contacted the GM, but he never responded to or acknowledged my concerns.We were upgraded on arrival according to the FHR benefits, but the sitting area of the room had no furniture. We returned to the desk, and I was offered a room with two beds. I told them that would be fine if they were queen beds, and they said that they were. They were not (and they don't seem to have any rooms with queen beds according to their website).After waiting for 45 minutes, I was told that I would not be receiving an upgrade because I had accepted and didn't like the second room. I told them that I accepted on the condition that beds were queen sized, which was untrue. Eventually an adequate room was found for me.There are a lot of things to like about the MO Miami, but I simply did not feel like a welcome guest. The lack of response from the GM suggests that they take no issue with the level of service they are failing to provide.Dear Guest,Please allow me to personally extend my sincere apologies for the disappointing experience during your last stay at Mandarin Oriental, Miami. I am very sorry about the turn of events that you encountered and the manner in which it was handled.

"This hotel was beyond disgusting. The walls and ceiling were covered in mold and crumbling, there were gaping holes in the walls behind the fixtures, the bathtub was clogged and the faucet dripped. There were roaches crawling on the floors and walls in the bathroom. I will NEVER stay in a Days Inn ever again. The photos on line when I booked were very deceiving!",Bad
"I wish we could have given more stars but the lack of communication and the promises made to me by the staff is where the stars come off. We booked our reservations weeks out and requested the bottom floor because we have two under two. This hotel has NO ELEVATOR, which we knew about hence the request. We have a double stroller and after a long day at the parks we did not want to carry both babies upstairs and come back for the double stroller. When we called the morning of we spoke to Nenetzen (sp), requested a crib and wanted to make sure they would be able to honor our first level request and also let them know we would be checking in late, we were told the crib would be in our room (it was) and we would get the first level. I also called 30 minutes before arrival to also confirm that the crib was in the room and that we were on the first floor, I was also given a confirmation on both. We checked in around 1120pm and they are unable to accommodate our first floor request. I could understand if I hadn't already spoken to TWO people the day of checkin but I SPOKE TO SOMEONE 30 minutes ago. Apparently shift change happens at 11pm and we got to load both babies upstairs. I was told to call back in the morning to see if we could switch rooms, I did, and the morning person wasn't in yet to speak with and was told they would call me back.... no one ever followed up. This was very disappointing and made us not want to return back to the room for our midday nap as it was a huge inconvenience. Pros- rooms were clean, hot water and seemed to be remodeled recently. Location. Nice size rooms, it was deeper than your usual standard rooms that have the traditional narrow walkway in between the Tv and the beds, it was nice to not have to move the cribs to walk around.Cons- continental breakfast we skipped after looking at the selections, mostly donuts. Beds were very uncomfortable and the queen beds seemed more like doubles. The cribs were on the smaller side, I had called twice to ask about their size and couldn't get a clear answer so anyone else wondering they are the metal smaller cribs, close to a mini crib and smaller than a pack n play. My 22 month old could not fit in it but my 12 month old fit fine, I would say max 18 month age. There are no curtains, just shutters, so the lights that light the property will shine all night long, hard to sleep if you're used to sleeping in a dark room.We are annual passholders and will chose a different location next time.",Bad
"We were booked here thru Air Transat package. The location is convenient, the staff is really nice. However, everything else is bad! The bed spreads were stained. The bed skirt was ripped.

There were stains in the ceiling, looked like a leak.It was a three star on the website but this cant be more than 2**DO NOT BOOK HERE!",Bad

"Short Staffed - Was the only one in the lobby, waited 15 minutes for the only staff member who was on the phone trying to find a reservation in the system to cancel it for someone who just made it. The caller should have been referred to the online or national call in reservation system. The hotel was sold out - perhaps Management should have thought to have more than one person on staff until midnight perhaps Dirty Bed Linens - Once in my room, was disgusted to find that one of the beds obviously had not been changed with new sheets. - Luckily it was a double queen room and the other appeared clean. The green bed covers were filthy and torn. Will not be staying at a Best Western again. Told the agent at the front desk who apologized and removed a nominal amount off the check. Travelling on business - so that really doesn't make much of a difference to me.Noisy Air Conditioning - When the under-the-window air handler came on, it sounded like an Chevy Suburban on at fast idle.Thank you for responding and providing feedback regarding your experience during your stay. I do apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused during you visit. I can assure you that we are fully staffed and two agents were scheduled for that night. Second agent left at 8:30 p.m. once things had slowed down. Unfortunately, we did receive a rush around 9:00 pm that night.

"We decided on this hotel based on its consistently positive reviews, however this was not our particular experience. Expecting a charming if not quirky older hotel in the French Quarter, we instead encountered unfriendly staff, a poorly situated and crammed room (tons of foot traffic and loud thuds coming from the building door outside our window) a sticky carpet, and most notably, an AC that blew directly onto the bed at night, resulting in a chest cold for the duration of the stay. I wish there were nicer things to say about this Inn, given its location and historic clout, but the room and the level of service of the staff we experienced were not great. Adding insult to injury, the parking arrangement (28 a day) involved putting our car in an open air lot that didn't seem particularly worth the money...we also discovered a scratch on the bumper when the car was brought to us upon hotel departure. I understand that Trip Advisor reviews have been quite positive about the French Market Inn, but had we known our stay would have been so contrary to its online reputation, we would never have stayed. Something to consider if you're looking for a pleasant hotel experience during your visit to Nola.",Bad
"After a long day at Disney we arrived at our hotel around 8:00pm. After checking in and taking out luggage to the room we discovered that the couch pull out bed was completely broken. We had only been in the room about 5 minutes. I went to the desk to ask about changing rooms or having the bed fixed. They would not move us and the bed was ...not repairable. SO, we literally had to remove the mattress from the couch and place it on the floor to sleep. NOT ACCEPTABLE for a Marriott Brand Hotel. The room price was not reduced or any concessions made for our horrible night. I am a Marriott lover, but I may have to consider changing my hotel brand.",Bad
"This place needs new management!! Jennifer the GM is about as useless as tits on a bull. Staff assured us on Monday that there were plenty rooms available!! Her staff (Christy, asst. GM)assured us on Tuesday and Wednesday that they would honor a gift certificate for one nights stay this weekend and Christy would call us back on Thursday with a confirmation because she didnt know how to enter the gift certificate into the computer. No phone call was received on Thursday so we call today. After 3 phone calls, we finally speak to the GM -Jennifer, who said they could not honor the gift certificate bc no rooms were available! This is a BOLD FACED LIE!! There are rooms available according to their website! Do not do business with this joke of a hotel! Customer service is terrible!! The staff is uneducated and clearly lacks customer service knowledge.Dear palmers1800,As I have mentioned on the many other reviews that you have written, I do apologize that we were not able to accommodate your gift certificate this past weekend. Gift certificates are donated as a courtesy to many charitable events that are important to the St. James Hotel family. On the gift certificates, we do specify that they can not be used over special event periods and are for standard rooms. Unfortunately, this past weekend was a special event and we only had 1 room available at the time we spoke which was our King Suite. I do require all gift certificates to be approved through me so I sincerely apologize if you received the incorrect information through our front desk staff. Christie, Assistant GM, began her career at the St. James only a few weeks ago and was not yet familiar with our policies and procedures regarding gift certificates. We would be more than happy to accommodate you in future. Please reach out to me directly at the below direct line. I do hope to hear from you so that we are able to show you the level of customer service that I know the St. James staff is capable or providing. Again, I apologize for any miscommunication and I look forward to hearing from you. Best, Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)962-0781",Bad
"I stayed at this hotel in October for 2 nights and it is run down, there wasn't even a glass in the room, nothing in the kitchen, carpet dirty, tub dirty and the room smelled. The second night I stayed there I went out the next morning to get into my truck and my tailgate had been stolen. I was a single woman traveling alone and felt very unsafe staying here. When I went down to the front desk to report it and check out there was only a maid working the front desk and it took 30 minutes to find someone that could help me. I filed a police report and after several tries I finally got to speak to a manager, that did no good as he just lied to me and finally the insurance company called and said they weren't paying for the tailgate. A hard lesson learned! Please, please do not stay at this hotel you are not safe, I'm just thankful I didn't walk up on them in the process of the burglar.",Bad
"Booked a double king two bedroom suite only to be placed in a king/full suite. Staff was not engaging and made excuses for things that were advertised on the hotels website but not offered.

"I stayed at the St. George the very first time I visited the city in November 2015.

"Had pre-paid for 4 nights, otherwise would have checked out. The room wasn't the cleanest. Bed was soft and uncomfortable.

"NOt a cheap stay in sd but I'll chalk that up to summertime. Hotel or should I say motel needs a remodel. Elevator reeks of urine.

"Room 711- This was a two night stay for a training session and upon checking in I discovered the desk chair was all ripped up (plether- plastic leather) missing from 1/3 of the seat, living room chair was used as a cat scratching post, stained dirty drapes, carpet-not vacuumed, no hot water in the tiny stand-up curtained shower-four mins into the shower-lather on hair and soap all over- (got points for my unfortunate experience). One of the bedroom doors (2 BR suite) had nail heads sticking out (discovered them when placing my hand there). Knowing that it was spring break week, I would think the staff was ready for the crowd- room was not serviced on day 2 of the stay until much later in the afternoon.

"Seriously...we stay at this property every year for market week. No matter what if you get in the shower past 7AM you will have a cold one! It is so frustrating. No use calling maintenance as they will not be able to fix it.

"Sure, I read the reviews that people wrote before we booked a room.....but I thought, some people just expect too much. I was wrong, I admit it, it definately IS as bad as people say. Oh of course this place will always have a lot of guests because it is so close to Seattle Center (about 2-1/2 blocks). The SPH owner knows this and probably feels he doesn't have to fix anything. Where do I start hmmm.. STAFF: although most are friendly, the early morning staffer is old, grumpy and smells like he hasn't taken a shower in a week. Someone spilled coffee in the breakfast room and he was swearing up a storm. He also was cranky when we complained our card key to our room didn't work. The owner/manager is also not too much of a people person. THE ROOM: our card key never worked very well, usually had to simultaneously wiggle the card back and forth in the slot, and give the door a kick. We had 3 different staff people on each day of our 3-day stay come up and open the room door for us because the key didn't work. The AC unit was behind a curtain (had to place the curtain on a chair to get air flow), was set at 60 degrees and the temperature adjustment button was broken (the room gets VERY hot without AC). The TV is very complicated to operate with a wall switch, two remotes, and a separate power box all needing to be synchronized to get it to work (we had to have a staff person come up to show us how to work it). Extremely bright construction flood lights are on all night outside the room window, so the curtain needs to be tightly closed (see above AC problem making this impossible). BREAKFAST: consists of orange juice, mini-bagels, mini-muffins, and poor coffee...skip breakfast here. The website says that they recently remodeled, but I think it was only the new floor tile in the lobby area because the rest of the place looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1950s. There is currently construction in progress on all sides of the hotel, so walking or driving to and from the parking lot is not the best or convenient. The view from our hotel room window is of the space needle and EMP, which would be great except the view is obscured by construction cranes and cement trucks. They are building a freeway tunnel behind the hotel. If you want to be near downtown, spend a few bucks more and avoid this place. Lowest price is not the best choice in Seattle.First of all, thank you for taking the time to review our property. We constantly try to provide our guests with the best possible service and hospitality, and we're sorry that we didn't meet your needs during your stay. Our policy is to provide great customer service, so we were troubled to hear that our staff was unusually negative towards you. Your concerns have been communicated to the management team to review and address. As far as the construction goes, we're sorry your beautiful view of the Space Needle was obstructed. Unfortunately, this project is out of our control, and we can guarantee that it will improve with the completion of the new tunnel. Finally, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our rooms and make them more comfortable for our guests, so we will take your comments into account. Thank you again for your review, and we hope you'll return to Seattle again soon!",Bad
"We booked here for a week months ago. As our cruise dates changed, we emailed our cancellation notice. We received confirmation of the cancellation and was shocked to find out that our Visa was charged the first night despite the fact that we had cancelled a week prior to our arrival.Our Visa company is now trying to recuperate our funds, but no reputable hotel would be so underhanded. ALL attempts to communicate the management/owners of the hotel has been to no avail.Do NOT book here unless you are 100 sure, do not risk it.

"Ok.. before I start the review - Can I just say that I always stay at budget hotels and never really have any issues.The continental plaza is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!",Bad
Double charged my credit card and then refused to assist. Room was only so so and did not fix broken fridge and bathtub or offer to move our room. Would never stay here again.,Bad
"Don't understand what others are saying when they say the rooms are spacious. I stayed in two of them, begged for a larger room, and was told they don't exist. These are very small rooms. The best benefits to this hotel are that it is indeed very well located and the company that owns it is a great group. But, here is what I kept thinking during my recent stay:The old mare has been ridden hard and put to bed wet. Joie de Vivre has put a 1,000 saddle on a 5 horse. Some paint (celedon), some fun art (mostly drawings and sketches) and cleaned her up a bit. But the trim is beat to hell, floor covering isn't secure in places, window air conditioners, dark rooms. If you like Joie de Vivre hotels as I do, let's encourage them to rehab the Galleria Park Hotel. She deserves it.",Bad
"Unfortunately the place was pretty old, even though they had renovated it a few years ago. When we first got to our floor, we heard a mom who was pretty upset saying they were getting the out of there. Another guest returned to room 421 saying, Pack up, we're changing rooms! And yet another guest went to the front desk to say the floor was wet when they checked into room 103 or 105 they were moved to another room too. We had four people in our room but only two sets of towels and one set of toiletries. There wasn't a safe in the room, though that was not explained I had to call the front desk to inquire, as the information card had directions on how to use the in-room safe (there aren't safes in The Annex, but there is one for all to use at the front desk). The TV didn't work for awhile, so i also called the front desk for that, and Maintenance came up the outlet it was plugged into was busted, so they just plugged it into another one and then it worked. The pool was okay, though we came down for one final dip before checking out at 11:30, but it was being cleaned -- at 10 on a Friday morning! No warning or any indication that it was going to be cleaned then, and a few guests besides ourselves were also waiting. There was also no mention of the beach chairs, umbrellas and towels, which I knew we had from the LivingSocial deal that brought us there to begin with only after asking the Concierge and going to the beach at 5 p.m., did we realize the service was only available until 6 p.m. The bathroom was the part of the room that showed the most age, especially the tub and shower, which ran at very low pressure and the temperatures were incorrectly labeled hot was cold and cold was hot. Room temperature was consistently cold too I had it at 85 degrees and it was still freezing.Now for some positives: The hotel's diner-type restaurant, Teplitzsky's, was awesome. Melissa was our waitress both at dinner and breakfast the following morning, and she was attentive and efficient, as well as very personable and friendly (she was also the only waitress at dinner, and one of two at breakfast). When we asked for more shampoo and conditioner at the front desk, housekeeping ended up delivering three more sets of toiletries, which was a nice surprise, though they were haphazardly thrown onto the counter in our bathroom (the sink of which was peeling off). Any time I dealt with the Front Desk, they were courteous and helpful. I thought I had left a ring upstairs after checking out, and they reprogrammed my room key to allow me back in. The jacuzzi was AWESOME, I have to admit wish I had more time to enjoy it, but I was with an 8-year-old so we were mostly at the pool. The retro decor in the lobby and hallway between the lobby and pool/restaurant were nice, as well as the Sea Spa's, but otherwise The Annex was just old. Oh, and it was great to have free wifi.Overall, it was a decent stay, but I doubt I'll be back, except maybe to try another part of the hotel, just not The Annex again. Either way, I would definitely go back to Teplitzsky's it was delicious and a great value, and they let us sit for as long as we wanted, which was great.",Bad

"The hotel overall is a great facility. I liked the room and the size of the room. The room was a little dated and the beds were very uncomfortable, but they are currently going through a renovation, so this should not be a problem much longer. My main issue was the service. My first impression of the hotel is what I would call the valet mafia. I just wanted to leave my car out front long enough to get checked into the hotel. The valet made me give him my key. There were several cars parked out front, which I later realized were valet customers whose cars were staying in front of the hotel and would not be moved. The check in staff was very nice and courteous. Very thorough explaining all their policies, etc. When I went back outside to move my car, I had to wait on my keys and it was obvious they were expecting a tip. After we got into our room, it was late, so we decided to just go to the restaurant in the hotel, Medici. Service was awful and we seemed to be an inconvenience for our waiter. Both mornings at breakfast in the Atrium Cafe, we received the same type of service. On Saturday evening, after returning from dinner, parking was a nightmare. Valet had taken all of the handicapped parking places at the hotel we were told we had to park in the deck which is a very long walk back through the hotel to the lobby elevators. This is not acceptable. But, my worst experience was in the lobby the morning of our check out. Apparently a guest had some type of issue. I do not know what it was, but a hotel employee (I think they were from the food service staff, maybe a chef) was working with them and appeared very put out with the guest. Situations like this happen, but what I found totally unprofessional was after hotel employee spoke with the guest again and coming to no solution, he walked back over the the front desk and told the front desk person that he was not dealing with this --. Totally unprofessional.Thank you so much for taking the time to give us your feedback, it is very helpful to hear about the experience our customers have had. I am very dissapointed with what you have described, particularly with the service in my hotel. It is not typical and I would like to learn more to enable me to follow through on your experience.

"We have been very happy at Joie de Vivre hotels in SF and could not have been more dissapointed by this experience. We had trouble from the start--rude front desk staff, bellmen who never even attempted to help with baggage, problems with the bill and double charging our credit card, mishandled arrangments with the airport pick-up, and a very sub-standard room for a steep price (nearly 400/night). We ultimately got an upgrade since we were paying too much for such a small room (and are members of JdV), but the damage was done by the rude front desk service and general incompetence. A good thing: The housekeepers are nice. The hotel doesn't offer the services that a hotel charging these prices should have--for example, they have limited room service (none on weekend mornings), no concierge , terrible gym, etc. Do yourself a favor and stay someplace else!I would like to start by thanking you for taking time to write and provide feedback about your recent stay. However, I am very sorry your experience was completely unfavorable. We truly pride ourselves in quality customer service, as one might read from many of the other TripAdvisor postings, and clearly fell short of delivering the consistent wonderful service that many of our Joie de Vivre members and other guests experience. Please feel free to contact the hotel directly so that I may find a way to resolve and change your opinion as I truly care about how you feel. Thanks so much for hopefully giving us a chance to make a potential future stay better and let us show you that we can do it right.

"Halloween weekend a friend and I booked a room at the Annex so we could enter into the various Halloween contests at the Tropicana. A room at the Tropicana was too expensive for our budget so we booked at the Annex which is next door to the Tropicana. The neon red light that says The Annex was the first giveaway something was wrong. We started joking about ladies of the night and hourly rates as soon as we saw it. Then there was a blinking red light pointing upstairs and again we joked about older married men that need a place to bring young nave women. The hallways were Big Bird Yellow and the carpet was old and moldy in the hallways. The room was worse. There was a horrible smell in the room, the white lamp shades were egregiously stained and pieces of the bathroom floor tile were missing. I complained about the smell and I was given an upgrade at the Chelsea which was 100 times better than the Annex. I honestly think they will upgrade anyone that complains. If you don't complain and you aren't upgraded it will be the worse hotel you have ever stayed at - guaranteed.",Bad
"I booked a guest for this hotel in October and had a hotel confirmation number - didn't matter - when our guest showed up in January, they told him he had been bumped because another guest was extending their stay at a higher rate.

"My partner booked us a twin bed room thinking it was the San Francisco Hostel International. What a mistake! We were given an incredibly squeaky (aka you can't roll over without waking up the whole floor including yourself) single bunk bed with stained mattresses. There was also some kind of unidentified matter smeared across the wall which could have easily been cleaned if they could be bothered. The bathrooms, halls etc we're all equally filthy.We asked to be changed into a twin bed room (as we had booked) or a double and we're constantly fobbed off by each staff member. Each would tell us to come back and speak to them again in x hours (when their shift had finished). When we went back they would be gone and it would start again. This also included the manager. I understand this place is closing in a few months (my guess is due to being shut down by health and safety) and as a result the staff do not care in the least. If you have another option then take it. And before you think this person sounds like a prude or is being precious I have stayed in probably 100 hostels allover the world and this is by far the worst. It also really affected our holiday in San Fran as there was no chance of sleep in the squeaky bunk bed. I note there are some decent reviews however most of them seem to be for the other hostel we tried to book (there ain't no waffles here!).You've been warned!!!",Bad
"Do not trust what you read on the hotel's website. This is emphatically NOT a luxury, boutique hotel. It is not artful, luxurious, or intimate as the website claims. It is a poorly maintained, mediocre hotel. Tiny cramped lobby tiny, ancient, slow elevator barely big enough for two people and one piece of luggage each. Cramped room, so small the door to the bathroom only opened half way before it hit one of the two double beds. Old, cheap furnishings (my wife said it was reminiscent of the furnishings she had in her first apartment after college). The mattress was so hard we had to put the comforter under the bottom bed sheet to try to add some softness. Like sleeping on lightly padded plywood. Bathroom had stained grout on the tile, mold in the corners, stains on the mirror, dysfunctional shower head... (I have submitted pictures to document the poor quality and maintenance of the room.) And this was a better room than the first one they put us in. The original room was blazingly hot and the only window for ventilation opened onto a noisy street. At our request, they moved us to the third floor on the back side of the hotel. Three friends of ours got a room here, too, and they complained about the heat and noise. The hotel's breakfast consisted of a bunch of loaves of bread, a toaster, peanut butter and jam, and coffee and tea. There was a small refrigerator and microwave in the room, fortunately. I can only recommend this hotel if you can get a room for 100/night or less and you don't really care about quality or comfort. It's only asset is location. They do have a nice wine bar.Dear Paul H,we are sorry you did not have a good experience at the FItzgerald Hotel. As you have mentioned in your review, boutique hotels have usually a particular style which is different from city to city, and that varies from one boutique hotel to another: the Fitzgerald hotel does have its own unique style, which is a classic post-Victorian San Francisco one, with a furnishing and an elevator that are meant to recall that time. We understand that some customers may not like it, but that is also what makes the Fitzgerald hotel different from the others. Also, since we are downtown, there is nothing much we can do about the noise, but we will follow up on your suggestion and try to see whether we can do some work to better isolate the building from street noise. With respect to the poor maintenance, I have printed out your review and passed it on to our staff who is already working on fixing the issues you were mentioning: thank you very much for that. We hope your experience won't prevent you from staying again with us next time you are in San Francisco, and until then we will work to make sure that most of the issues you have found will be resolved.

To basic of an hotel for 150 bucks a night. Tiny room. Squeaky bed. We couldn't even enjoy being intimate cause they squeaked so much loudy. They dont have bathrooms in the room.

"Trip was Oct 16-18. Hotel is not suitable for normal tourists. It is adjacent to and connected to a hospital. It may be suitable for patients or their families, but it is not something a tourist would want. The hotel is very old. There is a skeleton staff. The web site shows a nice food service area or restaurant. During our stay, there was no restaurant at all. These photos should be taken down. They are misleading at the least. There is no parking with this hotel. The desk will refer you to a public lot around the corner. The public parking has issues: (a) it has limited spaces for public use and you may be out of luck on a busy time (we did find one available) (b) it is not cheap (c) the main complaint here is that there is no in and out in this public lot. So, this is not like a valet parking where you pay one day and can go in and out. You park and are stuck or risk additional fees etc. The rooms are very small. The bathroom is tiny (one person only). The furniture in the room is old and not comfortable. Two chairs and a small table. You must be in the bed to view the TV comfortably. Food: as noted, there is no restaurant in the hotel. The food - - aka room service actually comes from the hospital kitchen. There is an elevator connection to the hospital, and you can eat in the hospital cafeteria. Otherwise, there is no food in the hotel. The staff was one person at the desk. No bell man etc. There may be ways to get a wheel chair into the hotel, but I did not see them. I saw several elderly ladies in walkers have a very difficult time getting up the 6 to 9 stairs at the entrance. The owners have put no money to update this hotel. If you call one of the room service numbers, the first prompt is for you to provide your glucose tolerance numbers. Quite a shock for a tourist with a first time in Seattle. On one occasion, I called the front desk. Let it ring 15 to 20 times. No answer. When I went down, I asked: why was no one answering the phone at the desk The answer: I was out for a moment across the street. It is also worth noting that there is only one elevator in the hotel for guests. Not a problem as long as few people are in the hotel. It was very slow a few times when the Seahawks game came closer. This is not an upscale neighborhood. There is a nice breakfast place about a 5 minute walk away. Starbucks an easy 10 minute walk (Well run Starbucks). From what we saw walking down to the ferry would not wise. There are good number of homeless folks down closer to the Seahawks and Mariners stadium (a Salvation army facility is quite near the stadiums). I did not feel it was unsafe for myself, but would not want my wife and I to walk that way. In summary, THIS HOTEL IS AN HOSPITAL ADJUNCT. It is not a place where a tourist would want to stay unless were the dominant concern and staying downtown was required. It is simply a very old hotel with limited staff, no food (unless you like hospital food), misleading photos on the Trip Advisor site showing a food area, no parking, and nothing to show that the owners have put any at all to improve it. I booked on hotel.com and was disappointed. For the price one does not expect a 4 star facility. But one would expect more than what this hotel provides.Thank you for your review. We are sorry to learn you did not enjoy your stay with us. The Inn is older. . .many of our guests find it charming and comfortable. The setting is more residential, off the main shopping/activity corridor but convenient enough you can still walk to Pike Place Market or the Convention Center. We are very close to opening our restaurant and I apologize you did not enjoy the room service selection provided on our menu. We are very proud to be a part of the Virginia Mason Medical Center campus. About 40 of our guests are tourists and 60 of our guests are here for medical related visits at one of the three major medical facilities in the area. And we are happy to welcome everyone.

"I don't even know where to begin with. I am totally disgusted with the entire experience. My nightmare began as soon as I reach the hotel and find out that my room (which was requested over the phone and confirmed by the front desk staff) was not available. I was given only 2 options, so had to settle for one. The property is filthy, dirty, stains everywhere from carpet, sofa, chairs to curtains and even on ceiling. Bed was very uncomfortable, loud noises from above, corridors, parking lots, creaking floors, slamming doors. Hair in bathroom, extremely loud a/c. The list will just go on and on.The icing on the cake comes the next day morning at checkout, I am asked to pay extra for my room. Rude staff, no sense of customer service whatsoever. I told her that I had booked the stay via priceline.com and pre-paid for my stay. She wanted to look at paperwork, expressly stating that I can't take your word for it, I have to see the paperwork. Insisted that she had all records, but surprisingly couldn't find mine. I refused to pay any extra money and she had to call and change the rate codes. Whatever !!Please save yourself and DO NOT ever stay at this place. I am disgusted beyond words.I appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your experience with us. The cleanliness of the hotel and the interaction with the front desk you described is unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize for your experience. To make sure this doesn't happen again, I am meeting with the entire staff to review your comments and discuss how we can avoid a similar situation in the future. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback.

"I stayed at this hotel for 3 days. I needed a taxi twice and both times I gave the front desk staff ample notice about needing a taxi but they could not get a taxi to arrive on time or arrive at all. In one instance when the taxi did not show up I almost missed a ferry on which I was scheduled and I would have had to wait a day for the next ferry.One of the hotel managers said they had 'problems' getting taxi's to come to the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel did not share that with me until it was too late. Otherwise I would have handled my transportation needs myself and not rely on the hotel.My suggestion is not to rely on the hotel for transportation, make your own arrangements.Hello James D.! Please accept my apology for the spotty taxi service. We do, at times, struggle to get cabs to our hotel during peak times.

We were told we could walk 15-20 minutes to get there. We had a rental so we just took it and glad we did because the walk back after all day at the park would have been horrible.

Booked a room for a few nights. Got there late at night because of my flight. Went to check in and give my employee discount and they said they couldn't even though I called in advance to let them know. They told me there limit employee discounts and they can't do them. It's one or the other but I was like how can you limit an employee discount. So I cancelled and booked one night to let management know next morning. Got in my room and the first thing I noticed was it smelled like pose. My wife went to the bathroom and saw a dead smashed roach on the floor and a small one in the tub. They had no towels or rags in the bathroom as we would not use them anyway from what we were experiencing. We slept with our clothes on and checked out asap. I booked another hotel while staying the night there. Didn't care about the discount just wanted out of there.

"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",Bad

"I stayed two nights mid-week in March. I didn't pay extra for the bay view but got it because just as we got in there was a large group of German tourists who just came in, which probably booked other rooms.The two queen beds were comfortable. and the pillows were nice and fluffy. In fact we saw many being replaced the day we checked in. (They were taking out old mattresses and bringing in new ones.) The amenities are good. A TV with cable, a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker made the fact that there's no continental breakfast easy, since there's a rite-aid down the street we bought hot-pockets and ate those in the morning. The view of the bay is amazing although it's true there is a concstruction sight to the right it's not very noticeable when you have the sun setting and the Star of India right in front of you.The pool isn't special and the jets on the hottub didn't work very well but the hottub was hot so that was nice after hours of walking. There are towels in the pool area which I also thought was nice. The constuction was not as noisy as people have said, although to be honest my friends and I left our room about 10:30 everyday and returned in the evening 6pm- midnight. Noise is a problem though as there is a railroad crossing a few blocks away, which you can hear clearly even with the balcony window shut. At night, cruise ships dock at the harbor which is also a few blocks away but the boats horn woke me and my friends up. This happened both nights we stayed and the second night two cruise ships came in so we were awakened twice that night!!! I can't imagine any of the other hotels in the area being any better though. There are hotels right across the street from the harbor which I think have to hear the same noise. I believe it's just a consequence of staying in a city.The area of the hotel isn't particularly nice, but it isn't particulary ghetto either. If you walk up India Street like 2 blocks there are a lot of nice little shops and places to eat and drink. (It's Little Italy) You can pretty much walk everywhere you want to go or take a cab - Horton Plaza to the hotel was 4. The parking lot is strangely full. I assumed many construction workers park thier cars there because once they were gone the parking lot cleared up a bit. The lack of an elevator in the parking lot is annoying because the stairs look gross. My friend drove down to the lobby, we took out the luggage and then she drove back up to find parking somewhere. 7 a night for parking is not bad at all, I'm surprised this is even a complaint. We didn't even use the car while in San Diego. We walked to the Harbor and took the Old Town Trolley hop on hop off tour that takes you pretty much everywhere you want to go in the city as a tourist.",Neutral
"This hotel Does Not provide shuttle service it is advertised on Trip Advisor as provided but is inaccurate please update as it cost money to take a taxi shuttle or ride share.

Would stay again but prefer accommodations with airline shuttle service.",Neutral
"Interestingly, the only vines you will see here are a few sad ones that grow around the edge of the parking lot. The location is ok for doing winery tours as you have access to the major Napa and Sonoma routes. The room was clean but the place was noisy.

"Hotel Abri has a good friendly team of front desk staff and a simply trendy lobby that gave me a good impression to start. The room is small and only minimally functional for a group of four (I should've checked the footage before I booked a double room for four). We had a street-facing room so it was really really noisy at night given the frequent ambulance, passengers and especially the construction noise that went beyond midnight (I didn't know that construction was allowed after 11pm in SF). Service and notes in the room were a bit confusing and inconsistent. There was no introduction pamphlets describing services of the hotel, no sign in the room stating that the water bottles weren't free. Out of my four night stays, one night I did not have enough towels, one with water not replenished, and another without any coffee/tea replenished in the room. Other minor inconvenience include not having hand soap provided, and the hotel does not have shoe horns to lend out. At the end I would still give this hotel a positive vote given their friendly front desk service and convenience of location.",Neutral

Unfortunately the location next to the main railway track with freight trains running every night and blowing there horns all night made sleep impossible!

"My husband and I called the Best Western 800 number to inquire about this Property. We especially wanted a hotel with restaurant, bar, pool and central conveniences and shopping. Expecting we wouldn't have to leave here for anything as we have been driving for hours. we were informed that all of the above are at this BW site After arrival... finding that there was a pool but NONE of the other amenities. this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. We also booked weeks ahead for early checkin. still didn't get checked in until almost 4pm. Other folks arrived after us and were checked in before us. Another couple we spoke with at the pool were mislead as well. The floor/carpet by the bed was soaking wet and smelled of musty/moldy..so we called for several towels to absorb the water. The manager gave us a bag of candy, pretzels and two pops for our trouble. I don't want to put down the hotel because it is quite nice ..we were upset about the MISLEADING information. because NOW we have 3 more days booked here in March that we cant get out of because we booked it through airmiles.Dear LBradshaw2014Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future.

"We'd stayed in this hotel about ten years ago, when it was very hip happening. Now, not so much. Still, the room was fine, the bedding good, and the cleanliness what you'd expect for a higher end hotel. Not sure what's up with the very loud air conditioning, though. Even on its lowest fan setting, the noise level was so high that my husband and I had to raise our voices to be heard. Overall, an okay experience in a hotel that used to be much more than okay.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. I am really sorry about your experience with the Air Conditioning in your room.

"I stayed here in Anaheim in mid August 2013 after reading many reviews. I reserved the 2 bedroom suite which only has 1 bathroom and the rooms are extremely small, hence the tiny beds (that claim to be doubles). We are a family of six- 2 adults and four children - 14 to 4 and the space was quite cramped. The hotel needs updating- furnishings are worn out. The drawers in the rooms were scratched and lights were quite dim in the bedroom. The full size kitchen is ok but rather small and the utensils and plates were not in the best condition. The breakfast area is very small and extremely limited. the staff was very friendly but I was overall disappointed that this is a Marriott property. I opted to only spend one night here and changed hotels the next day to give everyone enough space and an additional bathroom.Thank you for staying with us I apologize that your stay was not a pleasant one. Thank you for bring this to our attention as this will only help us improve. We are an older hotel, however I do hope you will give us another opportunity next year as we will have completed our renovation with our suites being a huge focus. I hope you enjoy your time in Anaheim. We look forward to hopefully accommodating you on a future stay.",Neutral
"For the price, this was a very nice hotel with some wonderful extras such as Quick Queue for the 7 major rides at Sea World for your entire party. The rooms are average and breakfast was much better than expected. My complaint when it came to breakfast was there were far too few waffle irons (2) for the number of guests their placement. However, This seems to be an issue everywhere. This creates a major roadblock as guests are waiting in line for a considerable amount of time and blocking the rest of the buffett.My biggest complaint was housekeeping - While my room on the surface was clean but quite obviously had not been vacuumed for a while as there was long hair everywhere. My other complaint was the thin walls and the long corridor make each floor an echo chamber. you will every door slam, conversations from the other end of the floor, and crying baby.",Neutral
"I want to like the Vertigo Hotel. It's quaint. It's charming. It's off the beaten path. And its staircase has a Hitchcock movie connection. It is one of many renovated small hotels in San Francisco. I like boutique hotels. While it's several blocks from Union Square, I easily walked it. Its a bit closer to the Tenderloin and I suppose the nearby grittiness adds to the charm. It's a neighbourhood hotel, not in the middle of the city and touristy madness. The staff know the area and make good suggestions for restaurants and things to do.With respect to usability, especially for business, it leaves a lot to be desired. The wifi is slow. It is shabby and worn. At one point the Orange in the lobby was bright and modern. Now it is faded. Check in includes instructions on how to use the shower because it is not obvious. The website says parking is available but fails to mention it is either expensive valet or several blocks away. In the final analysis, while adequate for business, it is better suited for visitors on holiday. I am glad to have had the experience of staying there, but will probably choose another hotel for my next visit. And yet it remains charming.",Neutral
"We have been to this hotel probably about 3 times but this time our room was very small so a little disappointed. Luckily we are not there too much so it was ok. Rooms were cleaned late in the afternoon usually after 3pm so if we were out during the day it was a little unlucky that you couldn't rest until your room was cleaned because you would be woken. Rooms were clean bed was comfortable and staff were friendly. I think when you want them to book you a shuttle and you have a coupon that is cheap it was suggested that the shuttle company was unreliable so recommended who they used which was a bit more expensive. The water for the tea and pre made coffee was not hot enough in the foyer so I would always check first and if not hot enough the staff are able to get hot water for you out the back from a room which wasn't a problem for them. The hotel is situated in a side street which is quieter but close to everything. To catch a trolley was easy you just walk down the laneway next to the hotel and you are at the DFS where they start from so you would get a seat .Aloha,Thank you for your feedback!

"Great service! Ben Patel on the concierge were very helpful. I think it's the only non pretentious budget accommodation in downtown Atlanta. The rooms were spacious and had a nice balcony view. I stayed there before and after my Tomorrowland trip in 2014. The best part of Motel 6 downtown is that it is at a very quiet location it is near to all the attractions i.e. World of Coca Cola, Georgia Aquarium, CNN headquarters. Also you'll find plenty of coffee shops and restaurants on a short walk. Hooters Hard Rock Cafe were near. And the downside is you will not find the like minded tourist crowd in this neighborhood as this is a strictly financial district.",Neutral
"We have stayed there previously. Location is convenient, most front desk people are very helpful, breakfast is all right. Rooms can be noisy.However: we were given room 209 which had its only window 3' from the restaurant exhaust system. The smell of food permeated the room. And, the A/C could not be used because it, too, was adjacent to the exhaust. We thought we would give it a try until my wife found hairs and red spots on the sheet.The front desk lady was extremely nice and pleasant as she is always. We moved to another room that had a roll away in it. Quickly I noticed black residue appearing on the white sheets. A quick check of the A/C filter showed it must not have been changed since Katrina...........black mold was all over the filter. And, on the sheets. The bathroom was not cleaned well. Hairs were around the tub and elsewhere. In short, housekeeping is not good. Cleaning is not acceptable. We elected to stay because we were tired of moving rooms and did not want to try and find another motel. Perhaps we should have done so. Overall, this place has potential but it needs a thorough cleaning as it has become mediocre Close off the room next to the restaurant exhaust. Clean the carpets and clean the rooms thoroughly. We will try the next door Hampton Inn next visit.",Neutral
"Walked into the room and it was small and sparsely furnished but, I guess there really was no room for a table. The A/C-Heat was the typical in that it had 2 temperatures (arctic and sauna) and nothing in between. The TV was difficult to turn off and on. There was only 1 glass in the entire room. The toilet had to be jiggled to stop running. This room was across the hall from a storage room and there seemed to be constant noise all the time. It seemed to be a novel way to turn a run down motel into a boutique hotel with a few contemporary furnishings that could not disguise the fact that it was an old motel. The tub had numerous gouges in it and you could see daylight threw the door (great insulation). We were charged an extra 10 to park and after returning from going out to dinner all the hotels spots were taken and we had to park 3 blocks away. We checked out and were never asked how our stay was or even thank you for staying with us. Will not be returning or recommending this hotel to friends or family.Good day and Happy Holidays.

It sounds like you stayed in one of our budget friendly rooms which do tend to be smaller. Sorry to hear that you had plumbing issues, we normally would move you unless we were at capacity. I do apologize for the inconvenience this issue caused you.

"Well we booked a room here since my gf likes boutique hotels and laid back atmosphere they usually provide. This hotel was not in the area we thought it was in, actually it was pretty far from what we expected. As it turns out that was a good thing. We weren't to far from Ocean Beach which is a fun experience in itself, and not to far from Pacific beach as well. They provide free beach crusier rentals and we had fun taking those out to get around quicker. Now the Hotel itself is in a somewhat run down area, and there isn't anything to see unless you bike for 30 minutes but we had an adventure because of it. Downstairs as all the other review say is fun. You can play board games get a drink and hang with a mixed crowd of people while enjoying a seat by the pool. The room is average, maybe a little below. It was clean (other than stain on sheet) and for the age it was descent. But we need to point out that the age does make a difference. The bathroom is dated, and the basic feel is a converted Motel 6 into a retro style hotel. But then again we didn't stay in the room long so those facts didn't bother me. The staff was friendly and very personable which makes up for the hotels state of disaray. I would recommend this hotel if you are open minded, enjoy people and music, and like the out of the box experience that you can't have at a huge hotel. Go have an adventure, get a bike and cruise to Ocean Beach.. just doing that makes the day rememberable..

There was fan on wall but it was so loud you couldn't talk. The room was very small, so much that only one person could fit between the tv and bed. The shower was horrible. The temp never stayed the same. The doors into the building and the elevators were barely functioning. The pool was dirty and the surrounding area. Breakfast was okay.

They had a (paid) breakfast but I didn't partake. The best part was the staff at the front desk, they must have stolen them from Disney, as they were exceptionally friendly and helpful. No real complaints, but they charged me more than my Disney hotel did, for far less value, and that just left a bad taste in my mouth.

The head housekeeper who came to the room to investigate after seeing the evidence of the ants was apologetic.If you have stayed in a MO property in Asia, you will likely be disappointed if you expect the same standard of accommodation and service.",Neutral
"We stayed at this property in advance of a week long trip with an 0700 flight time. Since we live 40 miles out, we decided to stay in town instead of driving in for our flight that morning. Our stay on the way out was lovely. We enjoyed a great meal in the bar, watched some of the Olympics and chatted with another guest who was in town covering the Arlington Million. Our room was lovely and we took a nightcap back to watch the planes fly over (every 2 minutes) and enjoy the sounds of the families at the pool. The fact that all of this was on the completely non-smoking property, it was a lovely evening. Our shuttle driver was promptly on site at 0530 to leave for the airport. But, of course, there was one guest who couldn't manage to be on time. While we arrived at the prescribed 10 minutes prior and others arrived in advance of the van arriving, the front desk called due to one, single guest who couldn't get his act together. Because they were so overly accommodating to him, I was completely blown away by the shuttle trip upon our return.We arrived at the airport, got our luggage and called the hotel. They informed us to go to door 2 at the shuttle center. We proceeded there - it is about a 7 minute walk for tired, suitcase lugging travelers. We arrived at the assigned door at 2316. With a number of vans there, we were trying to see what each of them were when we saw a Marriott van pull away and drive off - EMPTY. So, I called the hotel to ask whether their driver had just driven away even though we had called and he should have been alerted that there were travelers arriving. I was told that the van runs every half hour and that the next one would be at 2330. I inquired whether this meant that the van would be ON THE WAY or was expected to ARRIVE at that time. I never really got a clear answer. When a van finally arrived on the property at 2352, I started to understand WHY I wasn't given a clear answer. While we waited 36 minutes for a van, some others told us they had been waiting over an hour. Additionally, they stated they had called the hotel and been told that THEY missed the VAN. I am not sure how it is possible for the guest to MISS THE VAN - surely the driver has some responsibility for getting out and announcing himself when they are parked (stacked) in 2 lanes of traffic.Then, upon our arrival at the hotel, I used my parking ticket as instructed to leave the parking lot without paying the daily fees only to get an error message that my ticket was invalid and my fee due was 241.00. I tried 3 times and then started to go back to a parking space to walk back to the hotel and wait while the 40 people on the van got checked in to their rooms to get a valid ticket to get my car out of the lot when our friend noted that another gate was open for an event that was concluding. We pulled through it and left. I fly out of O'Hare on average 12 - 15 times per year for business and pleasure. I use park sleep fly once or twice a year. And I am an active Marriott member. I thought that I had found a new favorite but this experience leaves me irritated a day later. When I park at the airport, I can be off the property and on the road in a half hour. Last night, with a flight arrival time of 2230, we were finally on the highway at 0020. This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. Needless to say, I will be calling the GM at the hotel and possibly corporate later this week.Good Morning DLogsdon,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I apologize about the experience you had with the airport shuttles during your stay. I will make sure to share your comments with the appropriate staff. It is hard to say what exactly occurred during the time you were waiting for our shuttle at the airport and various things such as traffic, as well as trying to accommodate all of our guest could effect the exact time of arrival at the airport. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you,",Neutral
"I would stay here again because of its great location across from the park. We had a room with a bunk bed for the kids, which they really enjoyed. It was nice to just walk across the street and be back at the hotel after a long day of Disney walking. Beds not as comfy and breakfast donuts were moldy, but besides that our stay was decent. Also, parking is not free but it is valet serviced.",Neutral

The breakfast area is very small with a bad selection of items, however there is a diner next door if you want a cooked breakfast !",Neutral
"Good location, rooms are recently renovated and well appointed. WiFi a pain in the neck, lobby and common areas seem to be a work in progress. Lots of potent but it looks like they have a very limited budget.

"Pillows were perfect....but the room was stark and dull and not cozy, but it was VERY clean! Expensive but close to the Space Needle and museums, and very close to monorail and Ride the Ducks (which was so much fun!) - so you'll save money on transportation.The staff was very helpful.Breakfast buffet was Okay but the same everyday.Check out the rooftop terrace - wonderful views!ArloFamily,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback.

"I have been staying here during my vacation in NYC, room was clean and comfortable, breakfast ok and position very strategic. Service could be so much better, they held more money than what they should on my credit card because few dollars was missing at the check in. This issue wasnt explain clearly by staff but at the end they did not charged me more than what they should.Not more than ok.Thank you for your positive comments and I am pleased that you had a good stay overall.However, I apologize for the inconveniences that you experienced during your stay and don't hesitate to call me to share more information and I will try my best to rectify the situation",Neutral
"The staff was very courteous and went out of their way to be helpful. Had it not been for the staff, the hotel would have gotten a lower review. The lobby was well done with plenty of (mostly comfortable) seating. The elevators (when working) were very fast however one of them seemed to enjoy eating people (doors would close on you when exiting the elevator and would not spring back..I had to force the doors back open on more than one occasion). Over the course of the weekend the number of working elevators dwindled to one which caused overly excessive wait times. (At one point on Sunday, I waited for over 10 minutes for the singe working elevator.. I finally gave up and carried my luggage down the fire stairs).The room was okay, but not what I expected from a high end hotel. The room was more on par with some other more economical hotels I have stayed in recently. The air conditioner was noisy and would not cool the room. Except for the bed side tables, there were no drawers to unpack into (there were shelves under the TV, but they just do not work as well). In the bathroom the tub would not drain and there was mold growing on the tiles/groutAlso parking is expensive at 22/night (self park).Once again the staff was great and somewhat made up for the other issues.Thank you for your post and candid feedback. While I am happy to learn our staff was courteous and went the extra mile to be helpful, I am sorry you experienced challenges with the elevators and your guest room. You can be certain that I will have our engineering team take a look at the elevators to ensure they are in proper working order. As well, I have already asked that our engineering and housekeeping teams conduct room inspections to insure the air-conditioning units and tub drains are in proper working order. Thank you for letting us know. It is through your valuable feedback that we can continue to improve. I do hope that you will return for a future visit.",Neutral

"The location of this place is what makes it worth the stay. It's close to the beach and lots of restaurants within walking distance. Mission street is a block away. The rooms were decent but the bathrooms were rundown. The worst part was a weird smell that came from the rug. It made the whole place feel dirty. Also, you have to pay for wifi. It's worth the stay if you are not planning on spending too much in your room.Thank you for your comments. We are planning to renovate the remainder of our rooms very soon, thus eliminating the old carpets that could no longer be serviced. We hope to see you again soon.",Neutral
"The customer service was acceptable. The hotel itself is older, and overdue for a re-model.

"I really enjoyed the room and vibe at the Hyatt House in Seattle. It was a great hotel to chill out and get work done. We were able to work all day during a rainstorm and the room was comfortable and large enough for 2 people to never cross paths while working.My only complaint is that they checked me out early before my guest was ready and they woke him up and interrupted him 9 times between the time I left and he checked out. Upon calling the hotel, the staff was very apologetic and gave him a nice bottle of wine to compensate for the miscommunication.",Neutral
"We came into the city a few days ago on a whim. We had no reservations, no plans to visit San Francisco, and no real forethought. We just thought, Hey, let's go to San Fran! so we just rolled in. After frantically searching for a room in a couple of downtown hotels, we finally got a room here for a couple of nights. So it's not cheap, but hey... We are staying in a the center of a major US city, and it certainly isn't the most expensive hotel we've ever stayed in. Be advised, parking is expensive. And while I wouldn't call it up-scale, it is very nice. It appears that the hotel has been recently renovated, and our room was nicely remodeled. The furnishings and decor are all very relevant to today's modern styles. The bathroom is about as physically small as possible, but big enough to get your business done. I mean how much time do you need to spend in there anyway The bed is super comfortable, which is really nice when you are on a road-warrior styled vacation like we are now! It is true that there is no bellman, but that's ok for me, as that is one less person I need to budget my cash for. I'm happy to carry my own bags. The location is fine, as we have been able to walk all around downtown, Chinatown, and the surrounding neighborhoods. Oh, and they have this nice water jug in the lobby, with fruit in the water, which tastes really nice! It's been a fine place to stay for this trip.Michael S - Thank you for such a detailed review about your stay. We appreciate your feedback as it will allow us to further evaluate our hotel operation and help improve our guest service components. All the best and thank you for staying!",Neutral
"I stayed in February 2013. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was nice, pastries, waffles, juice, bagels, etc. I saw other guests around the hotel that looked fine and some others that looked shady. The condition of the outside of the hotel could use some work. My room appeared clean and in good condition with the exception of stains on the carpet, a rocking toilet, and water stains in the cabinet under the sink. The rooms are spacious and really comfortable with two TVs. The location was great. It's really close to Piedmont St. and a really nice neighborhood. Not a far drive from the interstate. It's about 5-10 mins from Peachtree which has lots of shopping, dining, and entertainment. It's about 30 mins from the GA Intl Convention Center and the airport. I thought the hotel was a major bargain as I booked it on hotels.com for 63 but one major complaint was the lack of soundproofing. I had some obnoxiously loud people above me that appeared to be stomping on the floor for about 10 mins. I heard conversations in the room next to me. And I heard every person that went up or down the stairs outside my door.Thank you for your recent feedback of our property. I am glad to hear that you were pleased with the breakfast, helpfulness of our staff, and cleanliness of the room. I am also happy to hear that you found the location of our property convenient to shopping and dining. Hopefully you had the opportunity to sample some of the many fine dining establishments that are in close proximity of our hotelI am sorry to hear that you had issues with noise from the surrounding rooms and stairs. Unfortunately, we were unaware of these problems at the time so were unable to address them.

"This hotel is beautiful, no doubt. Courteous staff even though not empowered to control the noise. Problem 1: Atrium layout and the noise carries up all floors and into every room. Problem 2: the restaurant had a duo of music both nights until 11:00pm. (Would have been pleasant and even lulled us to sleep if talented). Problem 3: young local urban crowd walking guest room halls making plenty more noise. Cherry on the cake of our stay. Bottom line, our weekend away at this hotel, not a respite from the long week. I am so sorry that you did not enjoy your weekend away. We do not typically have music playing past 8:00 pm and apologize for the noise.

"I love staying at Hilton Hotels and earning my rewards but Garden Inns besides being a Hilton and clean do not offer anything extra like the Hampton has free breakfast or the Double Tree has free, warm chocolate chip cookies. The service was ok but it also costs more than the Hampton and you get less. We used the wifi and that was ok too. The pool was nice but no hot tub. That does seem to be a struggle for our family to find a hot tub in the Hilton Hotels. I would try the Hampton across the street before I stayed here again.Dear Shari, We appreciate your candid feedback about your recent stay. Our sincere apologies that you were not aware that we did not have a hot tub on property and did not provide complimentary breakfast or complimentary cookies upon arrival. We realize that complimentary breakfast is important to family travelers so we do offer the Family Fun package which includes complimentary breakfast and additional amenities to ensure our travelers are extremely satisfied during their stay. Unfortunately Hilton Garden Inns are not approved to provide warm cookies we do provide a delicious freshly baked oatmeal bars every evening beginning at 5pm.

"I stayed with a friend at the Freehand for two nights in a queen bed private room. The room was quiet and clean, but very small. My friend and I were climbing over each other and our suitcases to move around the room. One thing that ruined the room for us was the lack of control over the temperature of the room. The weather in Chicago that week was in the mid-upper 60s, but the room was WARM. There's an A/C unit in the room, but no matter what we did to fiddle with it, it just would not get cool. Tiny room + humidity from showers + stubborn A/C + poor window ventilation stuffy stuffy stuffy.What also wasn't fun was being charged an extra 6.35 on my credit card when I checked my billing statement a week after checking out. I called in to ask about the charge and was told we had used the water in the mini bar. We had not. The front desk employee was nice enough to remove the charge, but is it not standard hotel practice to provide a bill of charges to guests before they check out Not doing so is at best questionable (why risk upsetting guests by not verifying mini bar purchases), and at worst predatory (are you just hoping we wouldn't notice). Also, 6 for a bottle of water I get better deals at movie theaters...In conclusion, if you're looking to be in Chicago on a budget, want to be in a good location, and only plan to use the hotel to sleep at night, then the Freehand might be for you. Just make sure to keep an eye on your bank account.Hello Jade Y, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am glad your stay was mostly enjoyable. I am sorry to hear, however, that the room was a little stuffy. I hope this will not stop you from returning in the future. I am also sorry you had a billing error.

"Although the accommodations were nice, the service and amenities weren't up to the standard you'd expect at a JW Marriott. Specifically -- when we reserved our room we indicated 4 guests, but on arrival were assigned a room with 1 king bed. The first staffer we spoke with was very unaccommodating. After speaking with a different staffer, we were able to change to a room with a king bed + sofa pull out. Unfortunately we found that room had no linens and it took 3 calls to the front desk to have them delivered. Lastly, the air in our room didn't work well and it stayed warm throughout our visit. I did, however, find the valet staff and the Nox grille staff to be very attentive. The breakfast buffet at Nox was delicious. This hotel has the makings of a wonderful luxury hotel, but needs a bit more attention to some of these finer details. Thank you for your visit and review. I am disappointed to learn about your service failures as we pride ourselves in providing outstanding services and exceeding our guests expectations. The service you received is not typical for the JW Marriott Atlanta. I do hope that you will feel free to contact me directly so that I can personally discuss your visit in more detail. In the meantime, you can be certain that I have personally followed up with our team on your comments. I do hope we can regain your trust and confidence and visit again.

"I stayed here for 4 nights with 2 other people, and overall, it was a good place to stay for a trip to Universal. I have only one complaint: the air conditioner in the room. First, it was LOUD, which was very annoying at night. Secondly, we had a double room, and the bed closest to the unit is very close and is directly in the path of the cold air. I slept on this bed the first night and froze, I slept here on the second night and woke up with a terrible sore throat, which really sucked all the next day in the park. Other than that, everything else was fine. The hotel is clean, the heated pool and hot tub was great at the end of each day when you're really sore from all the walking in the park. The free shuttle and breakfast was also extremely helpful. The traffic in the area is crazy at night, but there's lots of restaurants, pharmacies, etc. in the area.",Neutral
"While this Courtyard touts itself as being Union Square, it really isn't that close to Union Sq. It is walking distance to Union Sq., Chinatown and other sights, but not a block or 2 away. Our room, 708, was quiet. The rooms are small the bathroom has a motion detector which is great when you get up in the middle of the night, but not a great idea when you're taking a shower! Every couple of minutes, you have to stick your arm outside the shower curtain and wave in order to turn on the light again. Funny, but annoying. Speaking of the shower, the water is hot and the pressure is strong. The room has a small fridge breakfast is available for purchase.Linda F - Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on TripAdvisor. I realize that The Courtyard San Francisco Union Square is in somewhat of a unique location though we hope that our customer care was nothing short of your expectations when staying with Marriott and Courtyard hotels.

"I did the research on Tripadvisor and I must say it was exactly what people reported. It is within walking distance to all the restaurants and shops, the property is beautiful and well maintained with vibrant floral landscaping, tile stairways and wonderful seating areas. It is a bit of a maze, but this makes the property very fun to explore and if you are stair adverse you can easily navigate the property by elevator. We stayed in building 6 in room 641 top floor at the end of the building, nice size room. The room was dated but the bed was comfortable. Microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker are nice amenities. There was a sitting area with a chair and a small, uncomfortable couch. The carpet at minimum could use a good cleaning, but the rooms really need updating. If you only plan on using the room to crash after a great day of sightseeing this hotel is perfect.",Neutral
"This establishment looks more like a hostel that a hotel. Decor is decadent but charming. Staff is helpful and nice. It is located at a stone's throw from the Fisherman's Wharf. There is a Trader Joe's and a number of cafs and bars nearby. Close to the cable car and bus stops.My room was tiny, just room for a sink and a folding bed. No bathroom but a huge flatscreen TV. Bed was confy. Could hear the neighbour's TV but was so tired that didn't really bothered. Don't miss the massage coach, good experience.Overall I would recommend to stay at this hotel for location and flashback, but it seems a bit overpriced for a room with no bathroom and without breakfast.We have a reputation for being the best budget Hotel in San Francisco. We are located close to many of the most desirable attractions, the Cable Car is only 1 block away from us.Our prime location, 2 blocks from Fishermans Wharf, North Beach, make our Hotel a walkers paradise.

"I'm going to try to be as positive, kind and impartial as I can in this review because this hotel really could be phenomenal. I'll preface it with a pro/con section if you just want to avoid the whole written story.Hotel Location: Pro - Awesome location for the price Con - NoneCleanliness: Pros- Clean! Bathrooms and linens are clean.Cons - Housekeeping needs to show up for that to happen, which is no guaranteeRooms: Pros - Comfortable beds, clean linens, clean bathroom, modern bathroom, microwave, mini-fridge, spaciousCons - Some rooms much more spacious than others and you can get TERRIBLE viewsStaff: Pros - Helpful, if you get the right ones.Cons - Two were helpful. The others were as unhelpful as possible, even refusing to answer phones despite no other customers around. And one seemed kinda homophobic. It can feel like pulling teeth to get the most basic request fulfilled - a first experience of that kind.Breakfast: Pros - Really, really delicious. Fantastic coffee and delivered right to your room. Worth paying for, but comes free!Cons - It's like pulling teeth to get that breakfast slip and you may get a subpar, put together last minute breakfast. Parking: Pro - Cheaper than other valet services at hotels in NOLA. Takes the stress out of finding parking. Con - No self-park option available. They crashed my car causing a lot of damage. Hotel Value : Pro - Fantastic. Clean beds, reasonable sized rooms, really good location, complementary small breakfast.Con: If you're unlucky you may not get all of these things they promise/advertise, which lowers the value some. Experience:We booked this hotel same day as we were road tripping around the US and decided to stop in NOLA for the weekend. Expedia had a good rate on it, and it had fantastic reviews.Upon checking in the woman at the front desk was busy, a little tired, but friendly. However, her tone noticeably changed when she tried to double check that we wanted a single king bed. As a same sex young married couple, but we're discreet and get that question often. People are just double checking that we prefer that, but we've never had a really negative reaction in any country, city or state we've ever travelled to (even Turkey). This woman became pretty frosty and really...short with us immediately after. I couldn't figure out what I said to cause it, as, like I said, even if people don't like it, they're usually professional and just give us a room. I can't guarantee that THAT was what made this woman take a disliking to us, but we said or did something to get on her bad side quickly and boy did it stick! We got a single queen room on the second floor near to the emergency exit. The room was very spacious, for the price and very clean. Other people have said the beds felt really saggy and worn, but ours was really, really comfortable. The microwave was a really useful addition to the room and a coffee maker is always appreciated. The only weird part was that there was a welcome card sitting on the desk addressed to Mr. And Mrs. Thomas, or something, welcoming them to the hotel and the coffee maker had been used. I guess it was their room originally. Of additional note was our view - of which there was none. More specifically - it was of a brick wall a couple of feet away. We thought nothing of it when first arriving, but later found it to be strange as it has to be the worst view in the hotel. We noticed, same day when housekeeping was still cleaning rooms, or just generally had the doors open (I have no clue why) that not only were a majority of the rooms empty, but they had much better views and were almost double the size of ours. I have no idea why that room was picked for us, but it was.In regards to breakfast, they have a really fantastic set-up when it is fully put into place. You get complimentary fresh croissants and coffee or orange juice delivered to your room at the time of your choosing in the morning (between 6-10, or something similar). When we got up to our room the first time we called asking about the breakfast slip the front desk lady said would be waiting. She answered saying that it was in the drawer. We checked all of them and said it wasn't there. She said again that it was and hung up. Riiiight. We went downstairs when leaving to go to the French Quarter and asked the male desk guy about the breakfast slip and he said it was in the drawer. We said it wasn't, and he said housekeeping would give us one and that they put a new one in every day. Mind you, the stipulation of the complimentary breakfast was that you had to put the slip out by 10pm. Upon returning at midnight there was still no slip. Now, it's not the end of the World if I don't get the croissant, I don't really care, but it's kind of annoying if they offer it. We went back down and asked a different desk lady if we could get a breakfast slip. She replied, oh, of course! and grabbed one from a pile sitting under the desk. I don't fully understand why nobody else would give us one when they were sitting right there. Maybe it really was a housekeeping job. I don't know. So, we got breakfast in the morning, checking that others in our hallway has them still hanging and that they hadn't been collected. About four did, including the room two doors down. In the morning, we got our croissants and coffee only for them to be kinda hard and average coffee pre-made in coffee cups. Honestly, I didn't expect anything different so it was really nice. However, when we put our tray outside I noticed that everyone else (the other 4) had carafe looking coffee pots and slightly different plate/tray set up. Weird. Whatever. We get back after sightseeing to find we don't have a breakfast slip. Again. And our used coffee (which was used before we got there) still hasn't been replaced. We call down and speak to the initial lady who checked us in. She got a little angry and said housekeeping leaves the breakfast slips, that it's in the drawer and said we would have to order coffee on our breakfast slip they don't do room service. I told her I was misunderstood, we just wanted housekeeping to replace our coffee for the coffee maker, but then she asked why we needed coffee in the room if we just ordered it on the slip for breakfast. I said I would really appreciate having the option to make it at other times. Either way she told me shed send housekeeping and didn't. Later, before dinner, I realised I didn't grab my bag with my stomach medication when checking in the previous night. We went downstairs and asked the woman, who was the one that checked us in and already hung up on us twice, if we could have valet grab our car. She said no, they would only be able to go into our car and grab it. I said okay, but that it might be tough to find. I offered to walk to the lot and she said this was not permitted. She then pulled out a list with a bunch of crossed out customer requests on top, and added us to the other two new requests on the bottom. I knew it was busy and gave it about 40 minutes. Still nothing. My wife called down and asked if they could also grab her shoes while they were there, and if we could get that coffee for our coffee maker. Spathe same desk lady said yes. We waited another hour, and another hour after that. We waited a total of three hours for valet to bring my stomach medication so I could have dinner. At this point it was 9:30pm. We went back downstairs and the same desk lady declared, with slightly feigned surprise, 'oh, you haven't received your items.' I said no, that we were probably still on her list because she hadn't called about them arriving. She looked at the list, of which there were others listed below us, and everything was crossed out but ours. She said shed take care of it. Suddenly, 10 minutes later, they pulled the vehicle up, something she said was impossible before. I got my pills, gave the keys back and (stupidly) didn't tip because I was grumpy waiting for my car for 3 hours. On the way back up to the room my wife spotted a random housekeeping cart near the elevator and nabbed a breakfast slip, as we still didn't get one. She just got tired of asking and calling 4 times a day.Our breakfast, the next morning, was completely different from the day before. Delicious, fresh croissants. A metal carafe of fantastic coffee. Fresh pressed orange juice. It was a night and day difference from the day before. It was so good I would have actually paid extra for it! We checked out Monday morning after a really great weekend spent in the French quarter, and sightseeing. We waited, again, an unusually long time for the valet (over an hour) before a young 17/18yr old kid delivered it to us. The car had been crashed into a pole and had a busted up fender and broken trunk.The rest is overly boring detail involving the police, having to stay an extra night in New Orleans, and being left with 3k worth of damage.We remained shockingly polite throughout it, though I have no idea why. I guess I couldn't blame the young kid, he didn't do it and it was terrible his boss sent him instead of coming himself. I couldn't be angry at the desk girl, someone I hadn't even seen before she didn't do it either. I asked if my valet fee could be refunded, as nobody had offered yet. She said said and was trying to be very help, only to double charge us, instead of refunding it (we would find out the next day). We ended up having to drive cross-country with a broken trunk and body damage to my vehicle in order to get back home quickly. The rest of our vacation plans had to be cancelled and the weekend stay racked up a tab of nearly 3500, between the hotel, double charged valet and vehicle repairs. I will give credit to the manager, whom was very cooperative and, as I pretty much cried to her in frustration, made sure our stay and valet were refunded, and vehicle repairs covered. I've got a really biased review, and there were a lot of things that were problematic with the hotel, even before the crash. I understand that sometimes you have bad luck and a bad experience, which I normally totally understand. And, despite all this, I MIGHT still consider staying here or recommending others if they got their act together (but not valet, obviously). The valet isn't the hotel (but it is their only parking option). They were really exceptional at times, but really difficult at others. The location is great, the price really competitive, but there was a serious undertone of homophobia (the first time in my life I've ever experienced that) from one particular desk lady, combined with general incompetence from either housekeeping or the desk people.Dear Iselin,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a thorough review. I appreciate you detailing the good experiences as well as the bad. Here at the St. James, we have zero tolerance for homophobia. The city of New Orleans and the St. James prides itself on welcoming all walks of life with open arms so I am very disappointed that his was this experience that you had. I sincerely apologize for the lack of consistency with the service during your stay and can't thank you enough for reporting all of your issues. As you mentioned in your review, we did have a brief encounter regarding the damages to your car by our valet. I would like to apologize again for this inconvenience. Since your stay, I have had a meeting with our valet company about how these issues should be handled in the future should they arise. Once again, I appreciate your feedback and I hope if you are ever find yourself back in New Orleans you will give us another chance to provide you with the supreme customer service I know that we are capable of. Please contact me directly. Warm Regards",Neutral

"I was little worried about Hotel Abri at first. Its prices were much less than surrounding hotels which made me skeptical. However, immediately upon arrival, it was obvious that the hotel was just fine. The gift bag at check-in was a nice touch (especially the full-size bottle of whine). I had read the reviews and read about the gift bag, but I just assumed it included it one of those little whine bottles and a few other things. The room was small, but not any smaller than I would have expected for what was most likely an old apartment building turned hotel room. And definitely no smaller than 90 of the apartments you'd see in Manhattan. Despite the size of the room, it was well-appointed and had a decent size bathroom and shower. The rooms had window AC/heat units, but they were thermostatically controlled, which was nice (instead of just being a thru-wall unit with a speed knob. The morning breakfast bag left a lot to be desired (as compared to a standard continental breakfast), but it was better than nothing. They also give you coupons to the restaurant that connects to the lobby. We didn't get the chance to eat there, but it looked nice. Anyhow, there wasn't anything overwhelmingly fantastic about the hotel, not was there really anything bad. It was a nice launching bad for our activities for a long weekend. We walked to ATT Park for the Giants game (not far), and the cable car stop was only a few blocks away (as well as all of the shopping). Likewise, Enterprise retail car was just one block away (this came in handy because we rented a car to drive to Sonoma). All in all, a good experience, decent hotel, helpful and kind staff we would stay here again Fo Sho!Hello Matt B, thank you for your feedback.

"I stayed here for 2 nights in July 2013.I originally made my booking through the Adelaide Hostel online and requested a private room.When I arrived at the Adelaide Hostel, I was greeted by one of the staff who was outside having a smoke. (The hostel is at the end of a short dirty alleyway with mostly rubbish bins on the street. It smells, looks and feels seedy) Having arrived at 10AM I was super early for the standard 3PM check in for a private room. She guided me across the road to store my bags. I asked her for directions to the closest train station. She fired off street names and intersections at me like I was a local and then went off. Completely useless. I quite literally just flew into San Fran and had told her it was my first time! Not impressed.Having come back at 3PM for check in I was told that the private rooms are a 5 minute walk away at another hotel. The gentleman at reception was really not friendly or helpful. I grabbed my bags and walked uphill with 2 x 23Kg bags to Post street. Crossed over and walked about 1 minute to the Fitzgerald Hotel.The check in staff couldn't didn't my booking but somehow found me a room! 5 minutes of humming and being a bit flustered by the check in girl. I was surprised that I had to pay for my whole stay up-front! Very strange. I was given room 204. Its the room above reception. The elevator is super old and small and smelly and dirty. Moving bags up in this was not easy.The room was clean but super small. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. The decor was circa 1980's B-grade movie style. The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and there were stray hairs all over the place. The bathroom was practical though. Oh, apart from the bathroom door being like a patio door. It was completely see through glass! So when my friend joined me on day 2 for 1 night, one of us had to leave the room so we didn't have to see the other doing the dirty deed! The room was not cheap either. Its USD 140 incl tax per night. This is cheap-ish in San Fran but not in general.The worst part The staff. ALL the staff I spoke with were really unhelpful and it felt like I was being a right royal nuisance every time I asked them something. I wasn't asking stupid questions either - practical questions like the best airport shuttle or the closest good quality diner. The real winner - was when I went down to reception at midnight to ask if someone could replace my in-room phone as it wasn't working and had to call overseas urgently. The guy there was so rude and so abrupt. He actually sighed and threw his laptop when I asked him to check my room phone or permit me to use the lobby phone. When he realized the phone was broken he apologized and let me use the lobby phone.The only good things about this hotel: (1) wifi is quick and reliable. (2) the location is handy to cafes, restaurants and public transport.",Neutral
"We had 4 adults and 1 child (age 7). This was our grandchild's first trip away from home. Room 120 is marketed as a suite. It's not. It's a regular hotel room with 2 queen size beds and then a closet with a full size bed inside of it. I kid you not!The grandparents (us) wanted a seperate bedroom so we were stuck in the closet. There was not enough room for 2 adults to walk around in the room. You open the door and there's the bed. There was 6 from the edge of the opened door to the edge of the bed. The bed was up against the wall. There was one tv in the entire suite. That tv was outside of the closet bedroom. There was one side table lamp in the suite and that was not in the closet bedroom. The closet bedroom had a floor lamp on the opposite side of the closet from the bed and a blaring overhead light. There was just enough room in the closet bedroom to open one piece of luggage. There was a very small side table in the closet bedroom where one could put their clothes in...a bit tough if there's 2 adults in the closet bedroom staying 4 nights. What little carpet you were exposed to in the closet bedroom was sticky as though someone had spilled a soft drink by the side table.Had we known this we never would've booked here. Thus the reason for me writing to help other guests.The staff was extremely nice. We had rented a scooter and that was left in the hotel lobby overnight as none of the hotel rooms on the property would be able to accomodate a scooter. We were provided with plenty of clean towels in the one small bathroom in our suite.The pool was very clean.The breakfast consisted of frozen donuts (no microwave is available in the lobby eating area...if you wanted them heated up you had to take it to your room and use your microwave there), powdered scrambled eggs, bagels, small yogurts, a few pieces of fruit, milk, juice and coffee. Cereals were available from the bulk cereal dispenser and there was a waffle maker. The breakfast area was tiny. Since we stayed here from Oct 23 - Oct 27 there weren't a bunch of families to battle with in this breakfast area. I can not even fathom eating in the breakfast area during summer vacation, spring break, or during the holiday season when multiple families are in abundance. The seating consisted of 4 tables...2 tables accomodated 4 people and 2 tables accomodated 2 people (12 people total in the seating area). Of note, since this was something we had never experienced in any other hotels we've stayed in over a 40+ year span, there were two police vehicles parked outside the lobby with officers in the lobby that started one of our mornings off before heading to the Happiest Place on Earth. We didn't want to know what may have happened for their being there but the officers weren't there to partake in the breakfast, if you catch my drift.Parking was adequate and free. The maids like to trash talk about the guests in Spanish. This might be ok for persons who aren't Spanish-fluent, but we are. There's a sand pit playground area in the courtyard. It seemed to be in good repair. Our grandson didn't play in the area. I can't speak for any noise level this may cause in the rooms that surround the courtyard.Don't say you weren't warned. You get what you pay for. And no, we would never stay here again.",Neutral

"We stayed in the Annex, and the room and bathroom were both small. The room we had, one of the beds appeared to be broken. At the very least, the headboard was broken. However, it was has a nice location on the boardwalk, although slightly far from what appears to be the heart of it. Staff was friendly, food was decent, which was nice as the package we had included a food voucher and parking.One thing I still don't understand is why there was a pole (to support the ceiling perhaps) on the side of one of the beds. This massive pole, maybe 2.5 ft. by 2.5 ft., right where my head could hit if I weren't careful waking up in the morning. They should find a way to do something about this.Staff was very friendly and helpful. If you're just looking for a place to sleep while in AC, it's not a bad choice.",Neutral

"Like everyone else says, this is a hotel for those on a budget. The pictures of the hotel are a bit misleading, including those showing the insides and pool etc. However, once you navigate your way around what is essentially a block of flats, the rooms are a pleasant surprise and are actually the best part of the hotel. Making your own breakfast loses its appeal after 1 day, especially when the cereal machines werent working and the staff on duty dont really understand english too well. however, you are close to many of the 3/4.99 breakfast buffets so its not really a problem. we were dismayed to find how easily the staff coud get assess to the safes in your room after our battery ran out and they took nearly 45mins to come up to our room (after repeated warning that we were in a hurry). as i said, the room is great though and we weren't really affected by loud crowds. if you want great service and english speaking (as a first language), don't stay here but if you don't mind it for the amount of time you'll be in room, it'l do just fine. free wifi as well. just remembered....the day we checked out and left our luggage in the 'secure' area, we got the feeling that it wasn't so as the hotel employed no way of identifying your bag so anyone could have lifted ours but thankfully we had locks.",Neutral

"First of all we actually picked wrong location thinking where we had stayed previously. The other was at another exit. However, we checked in and went to our room and started to settle in. At some point in the evening my wife went to her side of the bed. There was a substance like a gel on the glass table by the bed. She pulled a Kleenex and wiped it all of. She plugged in phone/Ipad for charging and in moving away from bed noticed a condom wrapper on the floor. We decided to just deal with it. My wife told the girl at the front desk when we were going out to dinner. She offered to move us, but at our age it was more trouble than it was worth. We just explained that perhaps they should let cleaning staff responsible for that room that day of the findings. Was really surprised and disappointed.

it was my last hotel in serious of three during 11 day trip from san francisco so i can compare to few others. the room itself was OK. 2 twin beds that were a little bit small but no surprise there. the bath was fine but the weird thing is that the sink and counter space is outside the bathroom. another weird thing is a full mirror wall on the side of the bed...the walls are very very thin. i felt like the people in the room next door were talking to me. luckily we weren't in the room most of the time but still... the hotel is an open motel kind of space which is nice and has a warm pool at night with steaming water so that's fun. the location at hotel circle is great. close to a lot of things in san diego and i don't think we drove over 1-2 exits in the highway to any of the other attractions. just across the road is the fashion valley mall with a lot of stores and good restaurants if you need to rest.,Neutral
"I had a very pleasant 2 night stay at the diva- if given the choice I would give it 3.5 as I think it was better than average. I chose the hotel for its close location to union square and it's value price compared to a lot of other hotels in the area. Whether this hotel is for you really depends on what you want..I stayed one night in the Hilton parc 55 which had a lot more amenities and the 'posh ' vibe and then moved to the cheaper hotel diva as I couldn't afford 3 nights in the Hilton. I actually prefered the diva because of its great location and found the service in the diva a lot better than the Hilton. The diva bed was also more comfy than the Hilton and overall I felt the diva was much better value. If you are looking for value and a good location then this hotel is for you, if you want a grand hotel with a lot of amenities with a view to spending a lot of time in the hotel itself, then the Hilton would be more up your street.

The heavy concrete look is predominant at the lobby area, which I didn't like. The room was fine and had everything I need in a room. I asked about dinner at the front desk when I checked in and they told me that I can either eat at their lobby bar or order from one (only one!) restaurant they would allow in so I should look at the menu in my room. There was no menu in the room. I called the front desk and when they finally were persuaded that I don't have that book with a white cover in my room they said they will send someone with the menu.

"Second year I have stayed at this hotel. I have business in the area and it is convenient for me. Morning free breakfast is very good, hot, fresh and a large selection. Typical motel setting with free parking. Bed was very comfortable. I wasn't happy with the cleanliness this visit. My white socks were pretty dirty after walking around in the room. On check out I told them of 2 issues I felt needed to be resolved. They made a note of that. 2nd day, I returned to my room at 10 p.m. and housekeeping didn't freshen my room. Upon checkout I told the Front Desk, and they said, If you have a Do Not Disturb sign on your door at 9 a.m., they by-pass your room and don't come back. When I told them I removed the sign at 10:15 a.m. when I went to work for the day, Front Desk basically said, that's their policy. I find that policy totally inconsiderate. Next time in the area, I will seek another hotel.Thank you for providing us with your feedback and choosing to return to our property. I do apologize for the inconvenience you experience during your time with us. I do recall you mentioning at checkout that you had a DND sign on the door and removing it sometime after 10:15 am and I explained that housekeeping will not service room with DND sign but housekeeping do return later in the day and service rooms that have removed DND sign. I wish you would have brought to my attention about the carpet being dirty so I could have given you an upgraded room or offered some type of compensation.

"My husband and I enjoyed staying at your hotel except for one thing: bed sheets and linen. I noticed that the linen were not replaced with new sheets. At first I tried to ignore it but then when I was getting ready to sleep that was when I felt something itchy on my left leg and when I checked it, I noticed some red small dots on my skin. It started to itch the moment I sat on the bed.

I would like to start by apologizing for the inconveniences you faced during your time with us. As far as the sheets being changed in the room, the sheets are only changed every 3 days unless there is a different guest being checked in or if it is requested. After a guest is to check out housekeeping does inspect every room for bbs, so I do apologize if there was any concern for them.

"I recently stay at this hotel the weekend before Thanksgiving, and I had a few problems. I believe the best way for a hotel to do better is to let them know whats wrong. Overall I thought the hotel was nice and the staff was very helpful and this is good. There were a few hiccups, but I would probably stay again. (only if they fix the problems below)When I arrived Saturday afternoon, after my 4 hour drive, I really wanted to sit in the hot tub. I was told that it was not open due to some maintenance that needed to be done on both the pool and hot tub. I then tried to go into the hot tub the next morning and again was told it was not open and that it might be open later in the afternoon. I came back Sunday evening and it was raining, but the hot tub was finally open. So I sat in there while the rain came down and hit my face (not good and not long). Next I noticed the hotel had very nice flat screen T.V.'s in all the rooms that my family occupied. There was also HBO booklets next to the T.V.'s....only one problem. They did not have HBO or premium channels until the following weekend.. So I had to sit in a room with basic cable and no HBO or even the FX or History Channel. The breakfast was ok, but after the 2nd day I ate off site. The eggs were really watery and the sausage was as dry as beef jerky. The Orange Juice machine seemed to get worse each day, and on my third day it was like orange water. The elevator was extremely slow, and I think I could have walked up to my third floor faster. The elevators needed to be faster.",Neutral

"First the positives. I was in the new building which was just across the side street from the main building. The view was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was a little kitchenette for heating food at night. However the down sides were that the porch by the water was like a fire escape landing and people could go up and down the stairs. No privacy and can't keep door open at night to listen to the water. The room is pretty small for the price. The breakfast buffer wax excellent as wax the beautiful courtyard right near it. No room service any other time so plan accordingly. The bathroom was so small that two people could not fit in it. The staff were extremely friendly and the location is what you pay for. Dear Shaun B,Thank you very much for this review of your recent stay at our hotel. Please accept our apologies for the challenges you faced while you were our guests.We truly wish you would have alerted us immediately about your concerns with your room, we would have tried to accommodate you in another room. We are glad you found our breakfast options and location to be worthwhile.We hope you will stay with us again when you are in La Jolla, in order to have another chance to exceed your expectations, and for you to see we have used your feedback to improve. If youre so inclined, please feel free to reach out to me directly via email at danpaintai.com or by phone 858-224-7600.Thank you,Dan",Neutral
We spent four nights in the hotel during our last stay in SF. The location was perfect - close to the train and walking distance (we walk a lot) to many places that were of interest. But our room was tiny - the dresser drawers did not open all the way because the bed was in the way. The walls are paper thin. We heard conversations of our next room neighbors as if they were in our room - they were not being loud.,Neutral
"The hotel is beautiful and the room, inspite its small dimension, is very well designed, as well as the bar downstairs. But! The windows are very old and therefore all the sounds from outside are unfiltered and the room is very cold.The complimentary breakfast is quite poor and the breakfast room too small to accomodate the average number of simoultaneous guestsHello FP, Thank you for staying with us and for reiveiwng your stay. I am glad to hear you enjoyed the design of the property and the Broken Shaker. I am sorry to hear that you found the room to be uncomfortable, both due to noise from outside as well as the temperature. Your experience is not up to our standards please let us know on any future visits if we can help to address either of these issues as they are not typical of our property. I am also sorry you found our breakfast room to be tight. I hope you will consider Freehadn for a future visit.",Neutral
"Free parking but expensive REQUIRED valet. Additional fees and taxes than you will be told over the phone. In room whirlpools are surrounded by carpet which will absorb water like a sponge and you will need to walk on wet carpet all night.

We would like to apologize if you were not made aware that the hotel offers valet parking for a fee. While this information is posted on our website, we do strive to ensure all guests are made aware prior to booking their reservation. We have reviewed this policy with out reservation agents to ensure this does not happen again in the future. Once again, we apologize that this caught you by surprise as that was not our intention.

"After seeing the reviews, I was hopeful this hotel was cheap but good. We stayed for one night. So, I'm going to mention the things to work on and then what I liked, because you never end on a bad note. :-)Things that didn't quite meet my expectations:-I had booked for 4 people, there were only 3 towels. Since we arrived late, I really didn't want to bother with chasing down another towel.-the breakfast had bread to toast and bagels and dry cereal. The waffle maker looked like it had been used one too many times, as a customer was trying to chip off his waffle off the griddle. There were empty slots, like pastries or something was there, but they must have been out. There were apples, but one of ours was rotten (not their fault), but added to my annoyance.-the breakfast area had only 2 tables. Guess you are suppose to eat in your room-the a/c unit was about 3 feet from the end of the bed, so kept blowing on us - I had to turn it off and just endure the heat.-The room we had had two queen beds and a walk way from the door to the bathroom. not that roomy.-wifi was horrible on the side of the hotel facing the freeway. I couldn't connect even though they gave me a code.The good:-clean-good front desk service-cheap-microwave-refrigerator-bed was comfy w/ square pillows, so not very big (my preference is for rectangle).-parking in front of your room.FYI - You get lots of freeway noise.Personally, I won't stay here again - but if you just need a place to park your head for the night, I would say it is fine, but please lower your expectations.",Neutral
"Not too bad for price. Liked the free drinks, popcorn, and breakfast. It fit our needs and was pretty convenient to a lot of points of interest. The front desk was very nice, let us check in early and was able to recommend a couple of restaurants for big families. Needed room key to access elevator, so we felt more secure. Rooms and bed were comfortable, no complaints.",Neutral
"The hotel is under major renovation. I stayed here for one night for an early morning flight. It was very noisy when I checked in for about an hour and then it was very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpful and did a good job of keeping everything flowing during the renovation. There was plenty of hot water and the water pressure was decent. The towels are new, but the bath towels are small and I'm not a big person. The bed was comfortable and the room was warm even though the outside temp was 5 degrees. I feel the price was high during the renovation.Hello,We sincerely appreciate your feedback! Our public space is scheduled to be finalized very soon! It looks amazing!! We would love for you to come back and stay with us again. Yours in hospitality,Paulette M.",Neutral
There was definitely an issue with the bathroom exhaust fan system as we had a bad stench of sewer gas in our bathroom for the three days we were there. We asked at the desk and all they did was spray which worked for about 20 minutes then the stench returned. Should have offered us another room.,Neutral

I arrived late at night and the night watchman managed to mangle my reservation.

You pay for the location but the hotel was fairly average as compared to Hyatt properties in other cities. The service was good but not particularly friendly. Staff were pretty aloof. The rooms were small but clean. Just didn't like the vibe. We will stay elsewhere on our next visit.,Neutral
"We called months ahead and told them we had 2 mobility scooters and requested a 1st floor room. They noted our request but said that if needed we could charge and keep our mobility scooters in the lobby and that they'd be safe there. When we got there we couldn't get a 1st floor room (which we understood may happen), but we were told that we could park our scooters just outside the lobby, near the vending machine but we'd have to unplug the vending machine to charge them a the same time. We ended up having to break down the scooters and haul them up and down the stairs each morning and night. Thankfully there were helpful hotel guest and one hotel valet. Parking was awful. The valet people earned their pay. Location was great but that's about it.",Neutral

"I've had to go to San Francisco a lot for business recently and I've been trying many hotels around Union Square.Kensington Park Hotel was the best value for the time I was staying this time.Upon arrival, I realised that this was an old hotel. It wasn't poorly but it was just dated. The lady behind the counter was nice and I checked in relatively quickly.I was on the 6th floor and the room was surprisingly nice. The bed was big and comfortable and a big TV with three big windows. The bathroom was your typical white tile bathroom but it was tasteful also. Even though I was right by the elevators, it was very quiet.I didn't try the food or the theatre so I cannot comment.One problem was that you really had to slam the door shut. The latch was quite stiff so trying to let it shut on its own was not going to happen. For the first night, I returned to find my door ajar as I didn't close it hard enough.For another couple of days, the elevator was out of action so I walked up to my room. An unusual eclectic mix of carpets!Overall, it was comfortable. Given the location, it's good value and well maintained if nothing to shout about.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I will bring the issue to our engineer department in regards the door. We hope you will choose Kensington Park Hotel for your next stay in San Francisco. Warm regards,",Neutral
"First impression was not good,a temporary entrance what looked like a bedroom being used as a reception and as you looked up the hallway you could see electrical cables crossing the hallway and thick card taped to one side going down to the elevators.We could see as we walked to the elevators workmen in what would be the reception area.The elevator that arrived(there were two) was cloaked inside with blue quilted fabric over what looked like thick card,which also covered the floor,we later realised the workmen used this lift so there must be renovations going on on the 2nd floor.The bedroom and shower room looked as if they had been renovated no scuff marks anywhere and the tiling in the shower room looked brand new.The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size.Breakfast was collect your food in the one temporary room and take to another temporary room across the hall,with all of four tables.If both toasters were in use and someone used the microwave then the electric would trip.It was a standard,perfectly ok selection including bananas and patties in buns to microwave.There are no safes in the rooms so as advised by the notice posted on the door we asked at reception for a safety deposit box,sorry but the key is broken but if you wish you can put your valuables in with the hotels money,unbelievable!The swimming pool was off limits as the workmen were using that space.Having said all this the room was nice the bed was very comfortable and the staff were very pleasant,and Rickiea was extremely helpful in finding a resolution.I imagine once all the work is completed it will look good,but I would check beforehand.Why did we stay you may wonder,weel we had been travelling in all 16 hrs and we didn't want to go looking for another hotel and we only were staying for three nights.",Neutral

"The location is an easy walk (for San Francisco hills) to Fisherman's Wharf, Russian Hill, and Union Street. Got off to a bad start when we checked in. Had paid for a room with 2 queen beds, and got a room with one queen and a hide-a-bed. Went back down to he office to get it corrected - one clerk said there were no other rooms, and the second got us what we paid for. Rooms are dated but clean, hallway noise can get excessive. Did an early checkout, and when my daughter needed to use the restroom, one clerk said no facilities, the second let her right in. They really need to work on consistency. Plus side: this hotel appears to be used by many international guests and we had some god breakfast conversations as a result.",Neutral
"Was attending a concert at Amway Center, and chose to stay here. The staff was very nice and the call after we were settled in our room, to check if everything was okay, was a nice touch. The room was clean, but the comforter was heavy and the top sheet not wide enough. The ac unit under the window had to be turned down to 64, it kept going on and off at a higher level and it got stuffy. Would have been nicer if the fan kept running all the time instead of turning on and off with conditioning. Guess I got late to breakfast, because I didn't see a lot of the items mentioned by other travelers.

"I went there with my BFFL and she fell in love with it after 3 seconds... I'm still trying to warm up to it. It had the cozy, heartwarming and pittoresque appeal, But when the first love ended you stood there short of Oxytocin and felt the cramped space that minutes before seemed enough. The Window in the room that seemed so corky at first, facing the corridor outside the room to small to let enough oxygen into the room at night. And the wash basin in the corridor that was sooo 19th century be actually a way of the past. The bed was adequate but a tad to small for more than newlyweds. I will not do this ho(s)tel again. But my roomy she would wanna be buried there!Thank you for your honest review. In an era of selfishness and cynicism, close quarter and having to share your space, let alone your thoughts with someone else, could be daunting.

"Checked in here last week for two nights. Booked in advance a two queen bed room for myself, husband, and five year old daughter. Our normal hotel we stay at in Anaheim was sold out already (close to Thanksgiving) so we went with the Del Sol Inn since it's also equally close to the park.And that's the best part. You can walk to the parks in about five minutes even if you just miss the light to cross Harbor Blvd.!When checking in I was greeted the following way: Hi, can I help youYes, I have a reservation, insert name hereOh, I've been dreading you all night.Um, ok...Yeah, we don't have any more two bed rooms, so I have to give you a king with a roll-away, but don't worry, we won't charge you for the roll-away.Really It's only 8pm and I made this reservation months agoSorry.So then we go to park and of course there's no parking. We're assured that Valet is free, but you have to tip.The room is okay. Clean, up to date, AC/Heat worked fine.The roll-away arrives and it's horrible. My five year old refused to sleep on it and I didn't blame her one bit, it was really lumpy in some areas and hard in others, so then we shared a bed for two nights.Free Wifi wasn't consistent, but worked okay about 75 of the time.We didn't try the breakfast.All the hotels in this area have noise issues so I'm not knocking them at all for that.It was nice to have a fridge in the room.That's about it.

"The hotel staff was friendly and engaging. The property appeared recently renovated and well kept up. You need to be prepared for the surrounding neighborhood. it's 100 feet from some of the sketchiest places you ever want to see. Not one but two strip clubs, a couple of adult bookstores and of course, the obligatory massage parlor beneath the bails bondsman. None of this is the hotels fault and I would certainly rate them higher if the neighborhood was a little nicer.Good day Carver123,Thank you for sharing your experience with our team.

"Without a doubt the Comfort Suites location, room size and housekeeping are all A1, however we were somewhat disappointed with the staff's knowledge, actual room facilities and the breakfast.Staff were not that familiar with basic questions about the area and indeed gave incorrect information. Such basic information as to shuttle buses to the airport was met with - you can look it up online as was our enquiry about the hop on- hop off tour. Our room also did not have the advertised washer dryer and when we approached the front desk - we were asked 3 times whether we were sure that there was none in the room (sadly we do know what a washer/dryer looks like) and then told that they are upgrading washer dryers on floor 11 - mixed messages!Finally the breakfast was disappointing - at 8.30am - all out of hot food and at 6.30am a fairly limited choice. All in all - a very average stay.Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

I booked a room for two we was accused of having a third person staying in the room.Which was a freind who came to our room to visit who lives in atlanta so we had to pay a extra fee which was crazy.Also the men at the check in desk was rude middle easterns with bad attitudes but later became nice when they found i live in the city same they use to live in when they lived in the los angeles area.The location is great our orginal price was a good deal until they charged us extra for a third person with that price we could have went to a better hotel.,Neutral
"Our stay would have been great without the strong smell of air freshener. We stayed for 2 nights and asked not to have our room cleaned and the smell was still strong when we would return to our room. Other than that the hotel is nice, the bed is great and parking is included. The breakfast was very good with hot items. and a variety of fruit to add to our oatmeal (though it would have been nice to have hot oatmeal and not the packets). I would have rated it higher if not for the air freshener.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay! I'm sorry you did not enjoy the air freshener we use at the property.

"Its not easy to get a GOOD hotel ON Bourbon street. This is one of them, but you'll pay a price, of course.The rooms are not large, but comfortable enough. The bathroom was so tiny that they had to split the door so it could open. One lamp wouldn't light, but we managed without it. Otherwise it was maintained well enough.We booked a standard King room, but they ran out and HAD to give us a balcony room. I'm very glad that happened, since the balcony made a BIG difference. Even being on the street (albeit on the third floor) the room was quiet enough to sleep without bein bothered by the noise outside - which was considerable. The balconies are semi-private, so you need to lock your doors at night and when you leave. We were there during Spring Break and the streets were full of partying college-age students. I'm sure this street is full most of the time They have a pool, which we didn't use. The big draw of this hotel is its location, right in the heart of the French Quarter on Bourbon Street. That's what you're paying for. (And so will your car - 35 extra per night)Dear Jim,Thank you for your valuable feedback. We were glad to read you were thoroughly pleased with our location in the heart and soul of New Orleans at the crossroads of Bourbon and Toulouse Streets and that the balcony room made your stay that much more special.

"I've stayed here at the Astoria Hotel every time I've visited The City except once and I've been visiting on a regular basis since 1986-1987. I stayed once at the Olympic Hotel on Mason Street near the Hilton and the Marriott off of O'Farrell St. The Olympic was on par with the Astoria but was bought out by the Art Institute for dorm space or whatever so it's been the Astoria ever since. I guess if I was a Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt kind of guy I wouldn't mind throwing away 200-250/night just for a place to sleep. Not to compare the two properties obviously but there are many more ways to spending your hard earned vacation money there in San Francisco as any other expensive locale. But maybe I have it all wrong which is a distinct possibility. What is it they say about real estate: location, location, location... At the corner of Grant and Bush next to the Chinatown gate, you couldn't ask for a more convenient location. And for you Starbucks junkies, there's one across the street. And it's cheap and that's one word you'll never hear associated with San Francisco. I guess when I can book r/t airfare and 7 nights at the luxurious Astoria for much less than 1,000, I shouldn't complain. I never pay full fare and if I think rates are high I just won't go, simple as that. But a few simple amenities wouldn't hurt. Like, for instance maybe a couple of microwaves in the community room on the second floor so the guests can warm up some leftover restaurant food or even warm up a cup of coffee for heaven's sake. Don't know how much it would cost to Wi-Fi each floor but the community room has it but I'm sure most guests would prefer the privacy of their own rooms. The breakfast items served on the second floor daily works for something on the run. And how about some vending machines and ice machines. We're not asking the owners to break the bank here but I've talked to a front desk person there who has mentioned these type of amenities to the owners for years and has had no response.But then again who do you think is going to absorb the costs of these added amenities and renovations. Their loyal customers like myself. Maybe if some of us took our business elsewhere they'd get the message. Probably not. Food for thought Astoria Hotel. Is anybody listening there.. I must give a shout out to the hard working housekeeping staff. They do a heck of a job and at least my room has always been clean, or let's say clean enough. And maybe add a few more channels and upgrade the TV's and make sure all the remotes work. Just saying...",Neutral

"We were traveling to visit family with two school-age children. We booked the Radisson for two reasons: first, to try a Sleep Number bed because I'd like to convince my better half to buy one, and second, because it had a heated outdoor pool. Now that it's the Hotel Zephyr, both the pool and the sleep number beds are gone. Now it's modern, hip, and trendy - great if you're twentysomething looking for fun, but somewhat less appealing to us old and stodgy thirtysomethings.Had the hotel contacted us in advance, I would've rebooked somewhere else. But since they didn't contact me despite having my phone number, address, and email, we were stuck. The desk clerk was witchy (ma'am, I can't build a Radisson for you) but the front office manager was much kinder, recognizing it does stink to not be aware of the huge change in the hotel's target demographic and style prior to arrival and upgrading us in response.The beds are hard and the rooms are small, but everything was clean, fresh, and new with the recent renovation. The pool area is now a courtyard, the theme of which is actually junk: old shipping containers line the area, the sculptures are flaming old cathode ray tube tv sets, and crumpled aluminum cans are used as decor. Very post-apocalyptic chic. Again, cute if you're 20, but eye-roll inducing closer to 40. Unless you love to decorate out of the neighbors' recycling bins.The rooms do have cushioned window seats which are perfect for watching the fog roll in - we could see Alcatraz from our room. And the location is great, close to restaurants, shops, and the piers. As long as you're planning to spend a lot of time out seeing the city, this will serve as a reasonable home base due to the fantastic location.Dear KC,Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay with us!Yes, we are definitely not the Radisson anymore. Our property underwent a 32 million dollars renovation where the hotel got transformed from top to bottom in order to create our brand new property, Hotel Zephyr. In this transformation we didn't leave anything undone, thus our rooms were completely remodeled and upgraded all the way, including a higher quality of brand new mattresses. Our public spaces were also completely redesigned, our interior lobby got expanded over 5,000 sq feet opening directly to our brand new outdoor lounge area, the yard! all and all creating 11,600 sq of indoor/outdoor interactive space where we encourage our guests to let loose and have fun. That thought of going back to your childhood, embracing a sense of adventure and discovery was an essential part of the designer's inspiration while creating the fresh and fun environment in our hotel and specially in the yard. She used unexpected materials, from recycled corrugated metals and cargo containers to upcycled nautical materials and shipping crates, scrap transformed into treasure at every corner to evoke that childlike sense of excitement that comes with a great adventure regardless of your age! KC, I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our prime location and phenomenal views very much and that our front office manager was able to upgrade your accommodations as he continued to service you all the way during your stay to make it as enjoyable as possible for you in true Zephyr service spirit!Warm regards, Carmen CruzGeneral Manager",Neutral
"Visted San Diego and Hotel Solamar on the First Leg of our Honeymoon and were looking forward to visiting as we base our Hotel choices solely on reviews of Trip Advisor.Arrived on Labor Day (national holiday apparently) the day after our wedding and after two flight totally 13hrs and needless to say shattered at around 5pm only to find our room wasn't ready and we would have to wait 10-15mins for it to be ready, that then turned into 30mins and got told we could relax by the pool and they would let us know when it was ready, headed to the pool which was pumping music like a beach party, no problem as we were just happy to find a seat, 45mins later we headed back down and then got told that he by the same receptionist that it would be would only another 15mins as he had been dealing with something else, finally at just after 6 we got our room throughout the saga, we were almost made to feel like we were to blame. The Hotel and the room itself were fantastic and the quality and cleanness of the room were top quality and couldn't be faulted, we had a bottle of champagne and a happy birthday card Which magically later in the day to a Comgratulations card! Which was a nice touch.One of the first things we did find however was that the safe didn't work, which with our passports and cash etc we sure needed. Reported on the phone and were told we could go out and Maintence would repair, that evening when got back it still wasn't fixed, so called again in the morning to ask again and when still not repaired that evening asked reception for 3rd time. Still wasn't repaired so gave up asking!!wine hour was a nice touch, was served most evenings by a lady from the phillipenes who was lovely whenever we saw her, unfortunately on the Tuesday after a long day at the Zoo, there was a older blonde lady serving who was simply Rude and was possible the rudest person we came across, at first we thought she disliked us for bring a younger crowd, however when speaking to other guests in the lift we weren't the only people to notice this.The pool area itself was lovely and offered lovely views over the Gaslamp, unfortunately service wasn't much better when we did visit with the barman being more interested in the baseball game on, than any customers.finally when we did get home to the uk, we checked our credit card statement to find we'd been double billed for our stay, so after long call trying to get someone to help from within the hotel a voicemail was left and the problem that should never happen was resolved quickly.Overall we lovely San Diego, the Hotel we loved and the rooms were lovely, the Valet staff were friendly and the cleaning staff very nice but unfortunately too much poor customer service soured our visit. Especially constant failings over the safe problem and the rude blonde wine lady.We don't ask much where we stay, just a clean room and friendly, smiling and helpful staff, Hotel - Great, Staff.....Customer Service courses needed for many,I suppose what you pay is what you get.",Neutral

"This is a nice hotel, but for the price one pays for a room I expected a little more. The Hampton Inn we stayed at in Freeport had bigger nicer rooms. The girl who checked us in was new, so it took a little longer than usual. WiFi is not free-12/day. The shuttle to the airport was on time with a friendly driver. It's an airport hotel, so expect to hear the noise of arriving/departing planes all night.Dear Travelinpretzel, thank you for taking thetime to write about your stay with us. I am sorry that your room was not big enough for your needs and as you noted we do bill separately for WiFi (it is available for free in the lobby though). Should you return to the area I can recommend the Marriott Suites just 1 mile west from our hotel or the Springhill Suites just 1 mile east from us, both have larger rooms and the Springhill Suites includes even internet in their rate.

"I am not quite sure why this is a Best Western Plus. A Best Western Oke is a better description. But it was better than the one we had in LA. The hotel is located outside San Diego, near a Naval airbase (with sometimes some noise, but not too bad).It had a decent size pool, large rooms, and if you are lucky, even working WIFI.The lady at reception had a bit of a problem helping her guests, as she was on the phone to her sister or taking other phone calls instead of finishing checking us in. And although we booked months in advance, it was too much trouble to reserve to adjoining rooms but she 'managed' to get us rooms on the same floor.Not great, not Plus, but a good night sleepDear Harm-Jan W, Thank you for investing your time in reviewing our hotel. Please accept our sincerest apologies regarding the challenges you faced during your stay. We always aim to wow our guests and are so disappointed to have missed such an opportunity with you.

"Normally JW Marriott properties are very well-appointed, service is great, rooms are spacious and clean, and all the elements of the property are well-designed. However, I found this hotel to be very poorly run, poorly maintained, and awkwardly designed. My department held a weeklong meeting there in mid-January, 2013. The staff was absolutely top-notch in terms of friendliness and accommodation. Shortly after checking in, I used the lobby bathroom and it wasn't clean. At all. The room was nice, clean, and large. The bed was comfortable. Above the bed, though is a smoke alarm with a bright green LED. Bright and annoying. Multiple people taped things over the light from the second night on.On several of the days i finished with meetings around 430-500 pm only to find that housekeeping had not been to my room. One day, they didn't come at all. The restroom by the conference areas is just a mess. Fixtures pulling out of the wall, screws missing, stalls unclean.I will say that the food was good (though i never tried the actual restaurant) and they had a lot of healthy options. There are several shuttles that will drive you within a certain radius for free. Getting one is a little bit of a CF as there didn't appear to be much of a system.This isn't a bad hotel. It is, however, a terrible JW Marriott.",Neutral
"We were here for a couple of days before leaving for our cruise. We were in a queen room in the main building and facing out onto the street. The hotel was very quaint and the hotel staff were very efficient and super friendly. The room itself was a little tired but the bed was comfortable. The weather while we were in NOLA was pretty awful and the room was cold and drafty. The area has lots to see but can be a little sketchy at night. All in all it was a good deal and we would probably stay again. Hi Melody, thank you for choosing the historic French Market Inn. We appreciate your kind words about our staff and accomodations. Please know all of your comments have been shared with our managment team to help us improve our guest experience. We hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans.",Neutral
"This hotel is decent, but not perfect if you are on the picky side. Pretty design sinks that are a hassle to use, not enough hanging spaces for towels, broken elevators, etc.... The staff is great, helpful and super friendly. Overall, a satisfying hotel.Hi nelliebenoit - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. We are happy to learn that you enjoyed your stay, and that our helpful staff was able to assist you. The depth of the sink is designed to conserve water in keeping with our eco-friendly policies. We appreciate your candid feedback about some items not being to standards, such as the elevators. Thank you again for visiting us and we hope to see you soon.",Neutral
The staff at the front desk was not friendly nor were the people at breakfast. The only person who was friendly was the house keeping lady who I pointed out the water leaking into our bathroom from the room above us. The ceiling was being damaged and was damp. I wanted to make sure somebody knew about it because the folks at the front desk didn't seem to care.Thank you for your honest feedback regarding your stay. I am certainly disappointed in our team for leaving you with an impression of the hotel that is anything less than outstanding.

"Our room was extremely cramped and the hotel is in need of TLC. I can tell that the hotel is making serious strides towards improvement and the staff is seriously the highlight of the entire stay. They are wonderful and made us feel welcome during our entire stay. Besides the cleanliness factor in both the room and common areas, my biggest complaint is the bathroom has no countertop space. I love my toiletries and styling products and there was no place to put either. I ended up almost catching the room on fire because there is no counter space or even an edge of the sink in which to put my curling iron. I dropped my curling iron several times on the floor and it fell into the toilet at one point (hence the sparks and almost fire).Hi Ms. Adena B, I am sorry to hear that the room you stayed at was a little small for you. Please know for future stay that if you book direct with us, we can give you a complimentary upgrade to one of our urban suites (based on availability). We value your feedback and hoped that we can make it up to you in the near future. Stay vibrant!",Neutral
"Ok people, before the bashing begins just remember you are paying roughly 129/night and you get free WiFi and a hot breakfast to boot. All in an area where it usually runs 200+/night. You get what you want to pay for it. You will not get Hilton like amenities at this kind of deal.First the good:1) Great location, right off the freeway, 2 min from a huge shopping mall and plaza with everything under the sun to eat at. 10 min from Seaworld or Gaslamp or Qualcomm.2) Good breakfast, decent choices, some healthy items, coffee is good.3) Fridge and microwave in the rooms. AC works nicely. The bed was good, with a lot of pillows, which I believe they just switched out to new ones.4) Friendly staff at front desk. Now the not so good, or you get what you pay for:1) The pool is loud when active until 10pm. The rooms face the pool in an L shape, it echoes through the halls. If no one is there, then it is fine. During summer, it's brutal.2) The rooms do need updating. You can see it is a work in progress, but the walls in my rooms were all marked up, the decor was outdated. Hallways and elevator showed heavy signs of use. Pocket door for bathroom was very heavy and loud. One telephone didn't work, etc. Our blackout drapes were torn and pulling away from the window, so it did not stop much light during the day for my son's naps.3) Thin walls. We heard every footstep above us, every creak. We also heard everything in the halls, and with the outdoor floors you can hear everything rolling on it, or people walking through. Once asleep, not a bother.4) 8 parking fee. Whatever, it is stated on the website. Just add it to the room rate and call it free, makes the customer feel better and not nickel and dimed.5) Ant attack in our room, but they did remedy quickly when we notified. 6) The sofa bed was a joke. 7) Elevator would take us to level 3 when we pressed level 2. All day, until I told them about it.Look, this place is ok. You get good value for the rate you pay, which is cheap. It is obvious the manager is doing a lot of damage control here on TripAdvisor by trying to respond to all complaints, which reflects why the ranking for this hotel is so low, as there are a lot of complaints.Would I stay here again with family Probably not. But for a cheap room, and if I was by myself maybe. But not for my family, there were too many annoyances, but we walked out of there for under 300 total for two nights. Good luck people. But don't nail the resort for not being like Hilton when you are only paying 129/night ok!It was my pleasure to read your objective review that pointed out the things you liked about our hotel, as well as some of the things you had a concern with. We read and act upon all our reviews in order to improve the service and comfort of all of our guests. It is clear you understand we are a very conveniently located hotel that offers reasonable rates, unique room layouts and features, a free breakfast buffet and most of all, dedicated professional staff. I agree there are some aspects of our hotel that are a bit overdue for attention, however we do have an on-going and aggressive improvement and upgrade schedule. This year the focus has been on new linen, early next year will be the furniture upgrades and dcor, among other items. As much as we would like to, we cant get everything new all at once, however we do have excellent engineers who keep things running smoothly, or if a guest discovers something we missed. Some things like a busy swimming pool in summer vacation season or parking fees for most all hotels in this area are things we cannot change. Even so as you pointed out, we think we offer the best in rates, location and value to our guests. We sincerely appreciate your business and taking the time to provide your comments to us and hope you will stay with us again to see all the great things we are doing at Comfort Suites, Mission Valley!

I stayed here for 2 days and it was a nice place to stay. The room offered a mini fridge and coffee pot. The room was small but it was only me and I was there just for sleeping. The room was neat and clean when I arrived and while I stayed. I had a ways to walk to get to my room and it was dark so the map that they gave me didn't help much. The air conditioner was a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper it will bother you if you run it at night. The window does open but it is on the walkway side of the room. There are two hot tubs on the property and a pool. I ate at the cafe on the property and it was very good. They DO NOT offer airport transportation but I got and Uber for about 4.,Neutral

"I got a Travelzoo Offer and was eager to check out this boutique and non-gaming (no casino) hotel on the south end of the Boardwalk in between what was The Hilton (now Atlantic Club Casino) and what is still somehow The Tropicana.The Chelsea is a renovated smallish seaside hotel/motel that has been glammed up and given a hipster vibe featuring a couple of retro restaurants, a nightclub (C5) and two petite pools, the larger of the two offering cabanas five floors above street level.What you must know is that there are two towers. One, the Luxe is closer to the beach and features a bit more polish than the...Annex. The Annex is the luxe tower's ugly step sister and be clear where you are staying when making a reservation at The Chelsea as the Annex is still haunted by the ghosts of its fleabag motel past. Oh wait, those are not ghosts, those are for real and true prostitutes outside your window on Atlantic Avenue pacing back and forth and wishing they could somehow magically get out of the late 1980s, off of crack, and away from their pimps. As the Annex is only four floors high you cannot look down your nose at them from your still needing to be cleaned balcony.By the way, my balcony came security free, complete with no lock and no door handle (see pics). The room itself was clean in two dimensions only with no clock, stains on the carpets and pillows, paintings and mirrors missing, spills on the walls, and rust stains on the trash cans.A bit more grime than glam.But on the upside...The staff is lovely. Friendly and folksy. Even the black suited bouncers at the night club were attitude free. The drinks were strong enough although the DJ had the skill level of a pizzaria jukebox. Note that club admission is free to hotel guests before midnight although the joint tends to close early...2:30ish. Special mention goes out to the concierge (Michael, I think), my always eager and smiling housekeeper and Maxine behind the front desk.The crowd is out of The Real Word/Jersey Shore complete with the requisite twenty-something white girls whose shoes come off after only two hours. If you want to be treated like a big-girl walk like one...in your heels, all the way to your room honey.Decor in the public areas is just fine, and although I did not eat in any of the restaurants people seemed pleased enough.I love the concept but give the execution only a C. In the hospitality business it's always about the details and this is where The Chelsea comes up short. It's a shame that management and ownership cannot match their employee's enthusiasm and efforts to make this property something special and unique.It's also a shame that a walk down Atlantic Ave, towards the Tropicana feels dangerous. Being surrounded by real sad sack old school motels is not something that the Tourist Bureau can fix or the police can scare away.It's easy to get bored with the fake friendliness and always getting 10 less than you pay for mentality of the chain hotels of AC (Showboat, Bally's, Caesars, Harrah's, Taj...I'm looking at you.) so if you're looking for some edge and a dirt under the fingernails vibe, The Chelsea is for you.It should be a value stay so please never overpay.",Neutral
"Very fun looking property. Pool table in the lobby and board games in the bar. The room was large and sunny--modern furnishings and fixtures. The bed was comfortable. But....it felt a bit rundown. The carpet was threadbare and not that clean. The cleaner they use for the shower to prevent mold was so smelly I had to close the door to the shower room so I could sleep. I pity the housekeeping staffforhaving to breathe that every day. There was no tv remote in the room. And the valet parking system was problematic. You can call down to the desk 5 to minutes before you need your car. Both times I. Did that and the desk didn't let the valets know. I had to still wait, and they have to drive all the way around two blocks to get you your car. Not the best system. Needs better management and thought into all there procedures. We truly appreciate the honest observations and can certainly bring those to the team for improvement.

If you need hot water, you have to use the coffee machine to boil water.- The room we stay has water drainage problem.

"After reading a number of reviews about this place we decided to give it a try. The hotel itself is a motel. The staff that we experienced were all good and helpful. The Inn does sit at a busy intersection but with the A/C unit on in the room we heard very little through the night. We did face Lomard Street. The room was big with a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. These would come in handy as I would not consider the continental breakfast provided to be substantial by any means. However, it was something in the morning before leaving and finding some real food. The bathroom was big and clean though it could have used a couple of more towels. There was no problem having hot water for our showers in the morning. The linens were clean. The bed could have been more comfortable for our liking but we are all different and expect different things from our beds.Not being familiar with the lay of the land we took the info provided of others indicating it was only a 15 minute walk to the pier 39 and also used this in our decision to stay here. The location for being central is great. YOu are no more than 20 minutes to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. If you walk the other way you are about the same to Crissy Field and the Presidio. The World's Crookedest Street is about 4 uphill blocks away. Getting to here from the airport was uneventful and quite easy. The neighbourhood it is in is safe by our standards and we did not feel uncomfortable walking back from the pier alter in the evening. There are some wonderful restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood as well no more than a 10 minute walk in the direction of the Presidio on Chestnut.The free parking and internet were also added benefits considering the cost of parking in some areas and other hotels in San Francisco.With all this said it is not the greatest nor is it the worst. For the money we paid in San Francisco it did provide value for our dollar. As others have stated if you want upscale you will pay for it but this is not that place.",Neutral
"OPI's actually encouraging people via email to write TripAdvisor evaluations even though they're undergoing renovation of their bathrooms. I'm a little surprised since I can't really rate this stay as high as I have in the past, due to ongoing construction. Anyway, I stayed here 4 nights at their 99 construction rate. Can't beat the rate, though you will have to tolerate workmen pounding away on things all day long, including Saturday and Sunday. However, they didn't start too early in the morning. And there's a fair amount of dust and sharing of the (slow) elevator with construction dudes rolling away carts of material to dump. I had a side room for the first time - not as nice as the ones that look out over the pool to the beach, but it put me farther away from the construction noise so I didn't really mind on this trip. As always, P.B. can be a wild place on the weekends -- good or bad, depending on what you're looking for -- but be prepared.Thank you again for another review! We're happy you've become such a loyal guest of ours - and although this year you had to deal with some extra noise and dust, the goal of our renovation and updates is to give you even more value for your next stay with us.

"I feel very torn about the French Market Inn. On the plus side, the hotel occupies a perfect location in the French Quarter near the river. The cluster of old buildings it occupies surround an irregular courtyard that is lovely and full of charm. The complex makes you feel part of the citys history, and the rooms are very competitively priced. And the staff are very friendly and helpful. But our deluxe double room was very cramped and dark. Hardly any lights in the room and it wasnt possible to keep the curtains open very much as the big window faced directly into a public staircase. As a result, I literally had to use the flashlight function on my phone to see inside the small closet. The walls between rooms were thin, so we could hear the buzz of a low conversation next door and also woke up one morning to the cleaning staff parked and chatting In the corridor outside our door. Finally, we ran into delays with the valet parking, both dropping the car off (the space in front of the hotel was completely full up with other cars, leaving us no place to put the car) and picking it up at the end of our stay (we waited an extra half hour despite giving them a one-hour warning before we wanted the car). Thank you for choosing our hotel. We do our best to place guests in rooms that exceed their expectations and typically receive high marks for our accommodations.

OR do a better job of encouraging hotel guests to participate in activities. I really enjoyed my first night here so much--bed was very comforatable, loved the mod renovations amd the beta fish. I booked again for another night the latter part of my trip. I didnt' want same room again (17) because a/c squeaked badly and the curtain covered the unit. However, 17 was a cooler room than the room I stayed in, but prefered the a/c unit in the second room. Liked that there was lots of white noise to help drown out the street/bar noise. Stayed on a Thurs and there was a crazy bingo game--it is LOUD. You can hear the banging around of the other guests. Knowing now about bingo night, I wouldn't stay here again on a Thurs. It is a really good concept and people were having lots of fun, but noise carries here.Thank you for your review and feedback. Point well taken on our 1 night a month Bingo game. Very sorry for the noise challenge. We will be doing 2 things as we move forward. 1 is do a better job notifying our guests of our events and 2 to minimize the noise via stopping the bingo game earlier. I do appreciate your nice comments about our staff they do care and truly enjoy serving our guests. Hope you will come stay with us again soon.",Neutral

"Sometimes location wins out in picking a place to overnight, and this BW at the edge of the French Quarter has it. The most popular things to see were a 15-minute walk or a combination of streetcar rides. The staff was helpful, knowledgable, and friendly. No mis-steps there. Breakfast had eggs, meats, breads, potatoes, waffles and more. What are the negatives The rooms are dated and dark. The soft water combined with soap makes the shower floor a little slippery. Parking is not complimentary.Dear Fred, thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate the kind words of breakfast, staff and location.

"I stayed at this hotel for a business trip due to the proximity of the hotel to my customer.The Good:Great location. Close to Times Square (walking distance), the price (my company was happy with the choice) and the service people (always ready to assist in dinner reservations).The not so Good:The lifts ( average wait for a lift to the lobby was ten minutes), the bathroom ( let's just say I had a pretty significant problem that went unresolved for two days and it wasn't the sink or shower) and the noise on 39th street ( 2:00am I heard bottles smashing on the sidewalk and trash being picked up soon thereafter). I expect noise while in Manhattan but other hotels I frequent are much more insulated from the outside.For business, an okay choice, however, when wife and I head down for a long weekend of shows on my dime, it's The Marquis in Times Square for sure.Valued guest,Thanks so much for your honest and candid feedback about your stay with us! We really appreciate you choosing our hotel for your recent accommodation needs and we thank you for taking the time to share your comments with the Trip Advisor community. We sincerely apologize about the unresolved bathroom issue you experienced and for any delays with our elevators during our peak ours but we appreciate your understanding and patience.

"Visiting Seattle with my partner for an overnight stop on our trip down the west coast en route to California. The hotel check in staff were immediately unhelpful. I don't like the complexity of the car park and how badly sign posted it is. They should make provision for some limited parking whilst you check in but instead they leave you parked in front of the gate in limbo whilst someone in the party runs in to sort it. The room itself - a king on the 4th floor with views of the Space Needle - was large and comfortable with a good bed. The bathroom was, perhaps, a little basic - the toilet looked very down market and the shower had very poor pressure. Some nicer quality toiletries would also be a nice touch at 400/night. That said, we both slept well - though both found the air con to be unnecessarily noisy. The microwave display is also so bright that I got up to unplug it so we could sleep. We aren't the types to need pitch black and silence to sleep but it's almost obnoxiously bright and a discernible blue hue is visible even with closed eyes. Not good enough. The automatic blinds are a nice touch, however. Breakfast was awful but checkout smooth. All in all.. Meh.bhunjan,Thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to complete this review regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

"My husband and I have stayed at this Hampton Inn several times over the years on our way to and from Florida. We are finding that this Hampton has small rooms which are fairly dark. The bathroom configuration has always been a frustration for me - there is a lot of empty space that could be used. In the last room we stayed in, the toilet was so close to the shower door that it was like sitting in an airplane seat (no arm room). The knob for the flusher had just enough room to go down without hitting the shower stall. Very bad installation. The breakfast is the normal Hampton fare. I tried the croissants and they were old and heavy. The staff are always friendly and the hotel is located close to a large mall. I was going to book a room again for October, 2017 but saw that the price had doubled. As a result, we will be staying elsewhere.",Neutral

"I stayed here while in town for Dreamforce 2013. The location as great and couldn't be beat, it was close to Union Square and the street cars going to the Wharf. Sometimes there were a pan handlers outside the front door, but I noticed that was going on at most of the hotels so I am not sure that could be avoided by going elsewhere. The rooms were decent. Small, but everything you needed in a room. Unfortunately, I did not discover the fridge was in the desk until the day I was checking out. The fitness rooms is crowded if there are more than two people in it. I would stay here again.Dear AZHarris,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. I hope you enjoyed your stay with us.

"I joined a friend to attend a wonderful dollhouse miniature show this past weekend here in the Chicago Marriott O'Hare. Being very much a budget traveller when I travel alone, I figured sharing the cost of the room wouldn't be too much more than my budget hotels in Europe. Our room had a special rate because of the show but the 142 became became 191.52 with 2 nights parking and the normal taxes on both room and parking. My friends share would be slightly less - 164.80 because of the no parking fee.So, first of all, I thought paying for parking was sort of unfriendly. It wasn't like it was an enclosed lot or anything - just parking out in front of the hotel like most any other hotels I've stayed in in the states. And aside from its humungous and very nicely decorated lobby with seating galore for visiting, I didn't find anything really special abut the hotel. We had two beds with very noisy sheets (sort of like sleeping under paper coverings), no fridge(!), had to pay for Wi-fi for each day. Fortunately I had a personal hotspot that we used and when I called this morning to make sure that guests really had to pay for wi-fi in their rooms (another guest had told us no, they put it on your bill but take it off when you check out) and I mentioned being glad I had a personal hotspot and she said oh, you have to pay for that too. I said I wasn't billed for it and she looked up our bills and said that neither was my friend. I asked if I should advise TA readers that they can use their personal hotspots and she said no, because they'll be billed. So take your pick on that one. I, for one, couldn't believe there was no wi-fi and fridge in the rooms. Most of the hotels I stay in in the states are lower down the ladder - Best Western, Days Inn, etc., and I always have Wi-fi and very often have a fridge. And then there were just little things, we had a one-cup-at a time coffee maker in the room for which they provided 4 packets of coffee and 2 tea bags, one black tea, the other chamomile. And...the little cup that would hold the coffee grounds was missing. We both drank tea so just poured the water in to heat and let it drip out into our cups but I had to get extra tea bags because we both drink black. Our first night there, I couldn't get the bedside phone to work - have no idea why because the desk phone worked and they both worked after that first night.So, I guess I'm saying our stay was basically okay but if you want to keep anything cold, forget that and if you don't have a personal hotspot (or don't want to take a chance on getting billed for using it), you'll have to go down to the lobby for wi-fi where it's free but sometimes just has two bars although I noticed in the evenings it seems to be higher. Thank you for your feedback, and we're sorry to hear you weren't completely satisfied with your stay. The phone issue you experienced will certainly be addressed. As to the parking fee, all hotels in the area charge for parking, due to our proximity to O'Hare. We also offer complimentary internet to all Rewards members who book directly through Marriott, and we have complimentary fridges available upon request. We apologize if the internet policy was not properly communicated, and please don't hesitate to contact us directly if you'd like to discuss your experience. We're glad to hear you enjoyed the miniatures show, and we hope to see you again next time.",Neutral
"I booked this hotel because it had decent reviews and the price was cheap. The things I liked was mainly the location. It was very close to nearby attractions such as Sea World and Mission Beach. There were also markets and stores nearby if you need any essentials. I also enjoyed nearby places to eat that were local eats at reasonable prices. Another plus was that I was able to get 2 queen beds at the same price as 1 King. Also, no charge for parking.I didn't like how the towels were stained and dirty. The room was musty and the AC unit was under the window so whenever the fan was blowing, the curtains would fly up. The breakfast was minimal with different breads and pastries and bananas.Thank you for choosing to stay with us during your recent visit to San Diego. We consider all guest feedback to be an opportunity to improve and we really appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts. We agree that we are ideally located near SeaWorld and other attractions and entertainments. We strive to provide our guests with clean, comfortable accommodations at an affordable price.

I went to this hotel due to a business meeting and had some issues checking in. I was given the wrong room then had a couple of other issues but was quickly addressed. Still a bit of a disappointment having to go through all of that and not being greeted as an honors member after I mentioned I was. Room did seem like it had been updated some but shower still seemed outdated. Thank you for taking time to review Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center.

I do want you to know I have addressed this with my team as we value our Hilton Honors members and understand how important it is to offer exceptional service.

"I booked this hotel way in advance for the Billy Joel concert because I wanted to be able to walk back to hotel instead of getting on train. At first I did not look at my reservation, my fault, and went to the Hotel Lincoln instead.I was very excited when I got here. great customer service, friendly and helpful.The desk clerk said I was not in the system so i checked my paper and he said I was at wrong hotel. The baggage guy was so nice and loaded my stuff back into my car and waited for my husband to go get car. We arrived at The Inn at Lincoln Park and it did offer parking for 30 per night and we were so tired of riding in the car we said sure. They have window air conditioners and no electric door and no elevator. I was less than thrilled but we were not going to let it ruin our night. Get to the room and it is extremely small and you have to keep you curtains open if you want air to get into the room. Everything was pretty old and out lamp shade had a big stain on it. The pillows were like postage stamps and it was def no frills. We were woken at 6 am by a loud drilling from below. Not sure what it was but I guess that is the city. The price, even being in the city was ridiculous and I should have used a Groupon for a nicer hotel and took the train to concert. This place was not that close, even to walk.

"I stayed here about a week recently for business for some lengthy meetings. My hotel room was nice and well kept. Very clean. The staff was attentive. The conference room was good. Adequate A/V and the food the hotel prepared for the meetings were breakfast, lunch and snacks during the days I was there. All were quite good and well prepared. Give the chef a raise. If youre having or hosting a meeting or traveling on business this is a good hotel to stay. Its a quick ride to the airport and they offer a free shuttle. This location was fine for me. I like to walk but the hotel really isnt that close to anything. Surrounding restaurants were kind of scant. Mostly lunch joints. Youre close to the courthouse and government buildings here. The scenery around you isnt good. I felt the walk outside the hotel seemed a bit sketchy - especially after dark. Exiting the hotel right on Broadway takes you to the waterfront attraction. Lots of homeless, druggies and weirdos down along the waterfront that can be off putting. Its not too far from the hotel but not that close to the hotel, either. Exit the hotel to the left and you can walk to the gas lamp area. Its definitely a hike. Id suggest not walking to the gas lamp all the way on Broadway as the neighborhood down that way gets kind of gritty with a lot of homeless and panhandlers. If you walk to the gas lamp area from the hotel head down Broadway and go down 4th and then cut over to the gas lamp area. This 4th Street seemed to be a safer to me. Overall, this hotel was good. Some things fell a little short such as the pool area. It was a super small skinny lap pool. The deck area near it was a nice place to get some late day sun but they dont do the deck area any justice. Its uneventful. No bar area and nothing to speak of happening there. Just some couches and lounge chairs. The hotel should play this area up more. The hotel bar area was okay but most people are in and out at this place. No real reason to hang around. A lot of the local restaurants have good and affordable happy hour food and drink specials so be sure to get out, walk and explore. If youre a baseball fan do stop and see a Padres game. The stadium is a great experience. Finally, this is a good place to stay when traveling for business.Thank you for staying at the Westin San Diego.

"Stayed here for 6 days. Location is very good, right in the marina and cow hollow area which has many good restaurants and bars. MUNI stops right around the corner. The hotel and room are pretty run down. Old and and show signs of wear and tear. Tv made a weird noise. No AC, just heater(which also makes noise). Beds are ok. Bathroom is nice. The cleaning staff does daily cleaning of the room. For the kind of price paid, I didn't have high expectations, plus it was just a place to crash at night so overall it worked out. Area can sometimes be noisy due to the fire station being around the corner and bar/restaurant patrons walking the surrounding streets. If you are a light sleeper maybe some earbuds would be good. Overall: it's a budget hotel that shows its age and wear and tear. The location is very good and feels safe. If you are looking for a place to just sleep in, are not too picky about a room and don't have much money to spend in a nicer hotel then this would work for you.",Neutral
This hotel was a very good rate. We stayed here mid-september on a stop over trip to San Fran. The hotelroom had plenty of space for our family of 3 BUT it did smell really really musty.

"My husband and I just stayed at this hotel for our anniversary weekend and found that the hotel accommodations were clean and comfortable. The area surrounding the hotel was nice and offered a lot of options for dining. I would have offered a 5-star rating, but there were some noise issues that caused me to rate the hotel a little lower.The check-in process was smooth and incredibly easy. The Marriott app now offers the option for mobile check-in. When checking in on the app, the hotel allows you to let them know what time you plan on arriving in the event that early check-in is an option. The check-in time was 4:00 but we asked to arrive at 2:00. By 9:00 that morning, we had received a text letting us know that our room was ready and waiting for us when we arrived. The hotel lobby was really nice and the lobby staff was very friendly and accommodating when we arrived. Because we checked in using the app, we only had to walk up to the counter, show our ID, and our room key was waiting for us. It was very convenient and made for an expedient check in process. We liked that there was a complimentary self-park option because many of the hotels in Atlanta charge a ridiculous amount to park. That was actually the deciding factor for us on this hotel. The price was reasonable and allowed for free parking. The room was very clean and comfortable. One of our favorite aspects about this hotel was that there was a sky bridge that allowed for a short walk over the highway and to the mall. The mall parking lot offered a lot of dining options. We were able to walk to dinner and have a few drinks without having to worry about driving back. The hotel also offered a shuttle service that would drive us anywhere within a 3 mile radius. We didn't use the option, but liked knowing that it was there. We enjoyed drinks in the bar the night we arrived. The bar staff wasn't at all rude, but also not overly friendly, but the atmosphere was nice and cozy. We ate breakfast at the hotel in the mornings. It was pricey for the buffet, 19, which included juice/coffee/sodas, but it was delicious. We ate there twice for breakfast and the staff was very friendly both visits.The only major downside to the hotel was one that I noticed had been mentioned in some other reviews. The hotel was noisy, and the noise carried. Our room was 1250, which was right across from the elevators. People would exit the elevators all night long, and the noise carried right into the room, and kept both my husband and I up all night long. This really affected our trip in that we found ourselves going back to the room the second afternoon to take a nap before dinner. I assume that staying further away from the elevators and possibly being located in a corner room would fix the issue, but I cannot say for sure. This was the main reason for my lower rating. It's hard to consider the weekend a successful mini-vacation away from the kids when we came home more tired than when we left. I would recommend this hotel to others, and would probably give it another shot, as long as I was able to request a room that was in a corner and as far away from the elevators as possible.Thank you for a detailed review of your stay with us, I appreciate the feedback. Hope to see you back with us soon!",Neutral

"This is a brand new hotel in what seems to be a newly developing area near sea world. That being said, there's a lot of construction on additional hotels right next door. Every day during our week stay, there were people working, tractors moving and beeping at the crack of dawn and late into the afternoon. Also, I shared a room with the a coworker, although I appreciate the nice design of a hanging barn door for the bathroom, I think adding a lock would've been a good call. No lock on the bathroom door is a little awkward. The track was also not level on the door so it would slowly open when you tried to close it all the way. We had to resort to wedging a towel between the door and the threshold to keep it from rolling open.

"If you are taking an early morning flight from Philadelphia International Airport and you don't want to get up very early to drive to the airport, it's not a bad idea to stay overnight at the Hampton Inn adjacent to the airport and use their park and fly service. On a recent trip to North Carolina, my wife and I were scheduled on an early flight, and we live about two hours away by car. Rather than awaken in the wee hours to make our flight, we drove to the Hampton the previous afternoon, parked our car in their designated parking lot, enjoyed a good sleep and a good breakfast, and were driven to the airport by van on the following morning. All things considered, the cost was reasonable and we didn't miss any sleep.Like all Hamptons, the facility was clean and comfortable, the staff was pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast was more than ample. This hotel seems to be showing its age a bit, but that didn't negatively impact our stay in any way. The location is very good as an airport hotel...the van will get you to the departures area in about ten minutes, but there are only two convenient restaurants nearby, a Ruby Tuesday and the restaurant in the nearby Embassy Suites, and there are no nearby shops (excluding the airport, of course).",Neutral
"Hotel is ok , but need upgrades in the rooms, the carpet, t.v. Is small the bathroom can use up grade tike in floor.

"Having flown in from Australia en route to Quebec I had a stop over in Philadelphia. Looking forward to a nice quiet room and a break from the 20+ hours of travel it took to get to Philadelphia I checked in at the Fairfield. The free shuttle arrived as promised and the driver was friendly. Reception was pleasant but distant , the room was clean. I had forgotten to pack a power adapter and upon checking with reception and eventually translating the word adapter into a version of the word the receptionist could understand I was told they didn't have them only power point to USB adapters . Which was great for my phone. It was annoying to not be able to get an adapter from reception but even more annoying was the nonchalant attitude of the staff. Not in any way rude just uncaring . The free breakfast was welcome and filling . All in all the place was nothing more and nothing less than a 3 star hotel . Would I go there again If I had to , yes but I'd look elsewhere first Thank you for your feedback. I would like to apologize on behalf of our staff and assure you that your feedback will help us create a better tomorrow for our guest. I will your share your comments with the staff.",Neutral
"Although this hotel could use a new coat of paint (which it appears they plan on doing in the new year), our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive. I think the age of the hotel added to its charm and set it apart from most of the hotels I generally stay in - giving it character. It was definitely unique and the staff was very nice. They even upgraded our room upon our arrival. I definitely recommend this place if you want a location that is relatively close to downtown/union square without paying for the price of a downtown/union square hotel.",Neutral

"As Stash members we received a quiet room as requested on an upper floor away from the elevators. There was a musty odor to our tiny room that was otherwise clean and bright white when we entered. Toiletries are by L'Octane. Electrical outlets are adequate. Coffee and tea are served in the lobby in the morning. I was a little put off when a transient person walked in, used the lobby restroom, came out and made inquiries about jobs then proceeded to hang out talking loudly on a personal phone call.

"My friend found this hotel and we were looking for a good price and good location in NYC for 4 nights in October. This hotel is as expensive and so much smaller than where we stayed in Paris in Trocadero a year ago. This room is so small. We have two double beds,each up against the wall. There is 2 feet at the foot of the bed to the table, closet and desk. The bathroom barely fits a sink, toilet and shower/bath. I have never been in such a small room at a Holiday Inn Express. I can not imagine trying to fit 4 people into this room.Dear Julie H,Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us! We really appreciate you choosing our hotel for your accommodation needs. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations during your stay and are disappointed in ourselves for allowing you to leave unsatisfied. We realize, being in NYC, our property differs from those in less metropolitan areas. This must have come as a surprise to you and we apologize if this negatively impacted your stay.

"You never know what you're going to get. Pro: Nice, clean room. Con: Little ol' stain on pillowcase. Pro: TV. Con: TV reception reminded me of growing up in rural Kansas. Pro: Free Wireless internet Con: Kind of slow, but not bad. Pro: fitness center. Con: Two of the four machines didn't work. Pro: quiet room. Con: Curtains don't block all outside light. Pro: Nice continental breakfast. Con: None, Food was fresh and ample. Complimentary USA Today.It's overall a good value for the money. Ordered through Priceline, except that I rec'd a smoking room although I didn't ask for one. Maybe I clicked on something by mistake when ordering. I liked the pillows. They give you two different pillows with different thickness on the same bed. Evening staff was nice and professional. There is a very big pool and the area was nicely landscaped around it. All the outside doors are supposed to be only opened by a room key but I did not see any one them actually working when I was there. Perhaps they lock them late at night and release them early in the morning. I didn't see any unsavory characters hanging around.There's a refrigerator and microwave, as I recall. It's close to shopping and airport.",Neutral
1. Front desk crew courteous but very young.2. Continental breakfast is OK. At times you had difficulty getting a table mid morning. 3. Exterior of hotel needs painting and maintenance. 4. Air conditioner in room is weak. 5. This is not a Marriott or Starwoods hotel. 6. Location to beach is very nice. 7. Parking in garage is very tight. I damaged my right side driver mirror trying to park our Yukon XL last night. The parking garage is setup for compact cars. Not everyone drives a compact car. 8. Hotel maintenance staff is very courteouse and responsive. It is my guess that hotel ownership is tight with capital dollars for improvements if they can fill the hotel without too much trouble at the rates they charge. 9. The empty building across from the hotel should be torn down. It detracts from the area. 10. The fire department is one (1) building over. This is good if you have a fire and from a security perspective but bad if they are out on calls and sound the sirens. 11. Only saw a few street people. The SD PD made two (2) arrests of street people when we were there. They were very proactive in this area. 12. The location of the SD Life Guard station is very positive. The beach are by the hotel is monitored heavily. The life guard staff on the beach were very proactive on currents in the ocean. 13. The beach needs to cleaned daily from the seaweed. 14. We walked 3 miles up and down the beach and most of the folks seemed to be tourists that were on the beach. 15. You have many restaurant options within walking distance. 16. Hotel has onsite security in the evenings and after hours.,Neutral

"This hotel has quite a few things going for it. First off, it is in an amazing location for tourists. Right by Fisherman's wharf and close to all the sights there are to see. The hotels seems to have gone through a renovation recently and the lobby is actually a pretty cool place to hang out. Add to that the game room with ping pong, pool, shuffle board, and a couple other games plus the nice outdoor area. In the courtyard, there are fire pits, ample seating, more games, and a food truck. If you are traveling with teens, this is ideal. There is a bar attached to the court yard where you can get drinks and food. It isn't part of the hotel, but guests get a 10 discount with a room key. The staff at the hotel was nice and responsive if we ever needed anything.As far as the rooms, they are average. They are updated, but are still a little dark and dreary. Our room had a magnetic dart board, but only 3 darts. The sink in the bathroom was cool looking, but not very functional with very little counter space. We had a room above the courtyard and were able to see the ocean which was nice. The noise from the court yard wasn't a problem. The major issue I had and the reason for only 3 stars was the price. I know San Francisco is expensive, but I expected more for 450 a night. We have stayed in this area of San Fran numerous times and have paid the same price for a hotel, but it was much nicer. This hotel feels more like a 200-250 a night hotel. So, if you're looking at a time of year when the price is 250 or less, you'll be very happy at the Hotel Zephyr.Hello Annette, Thank you so much for staying with us.

If you're looking for any sort of view at the end of the day - take a 3 block walk to the waterfront and enjoy - because there's not a view to be had from your room.(we had 6 people there in all different rooms) It is a great location - close to most of the best spots in Seattle. The rooms are comfortable, but not worth the non-corporate rates. I would have been embarrassed to charge breakfast on my corporate card because it was so overpriced. So avail yourself to one of the many coffee shops.Hello Michael C, thank you so much for your feedback.

"My husband and I thought we'd stay here for our anniversary. Not a good choice at All!!! They not only did not have a room for us to stay in (as previously reserved), but they ended up putting us in a triangle shaped room that was as tiny as a corner closet...with a view of the building next door in close proximity. When asked to move we were told that they didn't have anywhere else in the ENTIRE hotel to put us. UNREAL! Not to mention that the staff seemed very uninterested in the fact that they were unable to accommodate us. I did however enjoy the location of the hotel, as it is adjoined to Lenox Mall and has great some great restaurants in the immediate area. This hotel was not at all worth the money!Thank you for planning your Anniversary celebration at the JW Marriott Atlanta. I am so very sorry to learn of your disappointment in receiving your requested room type. While we strive to ensure we honor as many of the specific room requests as we can (especially for a special occasion) we can't always determine if that room type will be available on the day of check in if that room type is still occupied from the night prior. It is not acceptable that the staff seemed uninterested and you can be certain that I have spoken with our team regarding the lackadaisical attitude you experienced. I am glad you enjoyed the convenience of the hotel and hope you will consider visiting again. We would love the opportunity to regain your trust and loyalty.",Neutral

Someone else was staying in that room. Lucky for us they was out.. Went Down again and got an another room. Thisone was ok. Good beds and clean room. But after we had checked in we was told that we could not use the water for showering etc.. we could only use bottle water. This due to pollution of water the day before.

"Well, I really wanted to like this place. I come to New Orleans 3-4 times a year. Typically I stay around the corner at another hotel. They were booked so I thought I would try this place.Checking in was fine but I noticed most of the other guests were tourists. That's okay if everything flows like it should.Continental breakfast is brought to your room per the order sheet you hang on your door.Monday night I made my selection and indicated it to be brought up between 7 and 7:30. Tuesday morning at promptly 7:30 as I'm walking out the door, the order arrives. I tell the worker I have to leave and to give it to someone else. I have meetings all week at 8:00.Tuesday night, I fill out the card and write on it, if it can't be delivered at 7:00 then don't deliver. Wednesday morning I get a call at 6:45 indicating my breakfast is ready in the courtyard downstairs.Wednesday night I ask the clerk how do I do this for Thursday and she says to just write it on the card for Thursday morning.So I make my selection and write that I will be in the courtyard at 7:00. This morning (Thursday), I go down to the courtyard and nothing. I sit there for 15 minutes with no one in sight. I leave and ask the desk clerk to get my car brought down and ask about breakfast. She knows nothing about it and offers to get some, but I tell her that have to leave.I get back to the room tonight, and there is no selection card...So I go to the desk and ask for one and then mention some of the difficulty with breakfast as I'm 1 out of 3. The male clerk basically stats arguing with me that I should have let them know. Luckily the clerk I spoke with this morning was there and she indicated the I did. The hotel itself is okay. It's old and smells a bit musty, but I don't mind that. The walls are paper thin as I had a virtually in room experience of the amorous exploits of the couple in the next room. I was a bit envious of his stamina....The floor in the room has twice vibrated as though an unbalanced motor is directly below me. Luckily it didn't last long and was only twice.There is dried paint all over the place in the bathroom so maintenance is obviously is sloppy.As indicated there seem to be a lot of foreign travelers here which they seem to cater to.So if you don't have time constraints it's probably an okay hotel, otherwise you might be better off somewhere else.",Neutral

"Room temperature could not be controlled. Adjusting the thermostat was evidently a placebo. Upon check out I was told I would be emailed a copy of my bill. Stayed in the room Tuesday, on Friday still no email. Made reservation through travel agent. While on the road called travel agent mid-afternoon on my scheduled arrival date to cancel and re-book a different city. To the surprise of travel agent hotel imposes a required three day notice of cancellation policy rather than the industry standard same day before 6:00PM. Travel agent called hotel direct and was told I could cancel, but they would still charge my card. Of course this gave them the opportunity to charge me and then possibly still rent the room to another party, while I would be stuck paying them as well as another hotel for a room. I travel about 40 weeks a year thus I have a least 40 opportunities to never again stay in an Aloft hotel, plus I might remember to warn all my fellow travelers.Well it certainly sounds like we didn't get it right for you and for that I sincerely apologize. We do in fact have a 72 hour cancellation policy that would have been clearly stated on the reservation when your travel agent booked so it certainly seems they would have informed you of that especially if you have a volatile schedule.

"Booked for SDSU move in weekend. Two of our three nights were pricey considering this is a musty, ordinary, ugly hotel. Only one clerk at the front desk. He was very nice, but the lobby was worn and not too clean. The rooms appeared clean and pretty standard but the toilet was difficult to flush with the handle reversed. Second night the youth football team checked in contributing to noise and parking chaos. The free breakfast was not too great( I think the scrambled eggs were not real). Should have stayed anywhere else.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.",Neutral
"Overall, I enjoyed my two night stay at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Downtown Chicago, but have a few concerns. I was in town with a bus load of University of Louisville fans to support our basketball team during the game with DePaul University. There were not enough suites available with two double beds at the hotel to accommodate our group. So, I had to share a king-sized bed with my roommate. We were really disappointed that we couldn't have our own bed. So, we each rotated sleepng in the bed one night and then sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room. However, the sofa bed was absoultely horrible!!! The mattress was very thin and the inner springs poked through the surface of the mattress. This made sleeping very uncomfortable. Also, the top portion of the mattress where your head goes was higher than the rest of the mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a slant. The mattress was so uncomfortable until I closed the sofa bed and replaced the cushions. Then I tried putting the cover on top and sleepng on top of the sofa, However, I am 5'11 tall and the sofa was more like a loveseat size. So, I could not stretch out completely. I got very little sleep and awoke stiff and sore. My back and neck hurt. It was also awkward having to go through the bedroom to use the toilet and shower in the bathroom or to get clothes from the closet without disturbing my roommate while she slept in the bed. The layout of the suite was not well-thoughout as far as utilization of the bathroom and closet.On the plus side of the suite, the kitchen was wonderful! We liked having a fully equipped kitchen with appliances and dishes. We also enjoyed the breakfast! Shirley Fuqua-Jackson, Room 1203Shirley, I am sorry that you did not enjoy your stay at the hotel. I wanted to address your concern about not receiving a room with two double beds. When looking back at the original rooming list that we have from your group leader we do not have you and your roommate in a room with two double beds. The room type that your group leader had assigned to your room was a King Suite with the sleeper sofa. The hotel des have a very limited number of double/double rooms on property so we were unable to change room types if we do not have the availability. I do want to express regret over this misunderstanding. I do apologize for the uncomfortable evening that you spent on our sleeper sofa. We are in the process of replacing all of our bed inserts and we do hope that nobody will be as inconvenienced as you in the future. We do have a limited number of complimentary roll-away beds available if you find the sleeper sofa too uncomfortable in the future. We are pleased that you enjoyed the breakfast and the full stocked kitchen. We do hope to see you again. Sincerely, Vanessa KosloskiSales and Marketing Manager",Neutral
"When checking into a 300+ a night room I expect my bags to be brought to my room. I do not expect to be told to go through the restaurant and meander about until you see elevators. On my meander I did notice a pool which seemed indoor/outdoor and would have possibly been enticing were I not carrying my own luggage and trying to follow the directions given by desk clerk. The room itself was small, but quite clean. There was nothing wrong with it, nor was there anything special. My son enjoyed his room service meal of ribs. Two glasses of Pinot Grigio arrived as Chardonnay with no explanation. Check out was simple, airport shuttle thankfully was beyond efficient, I believe the driver Hector (I believe. It definitely started with a H) was completely aces. Obviously there are better places to stay in Chicago, but I needed something near airport bc of a missed connection. This did the job of clean bed and shower, decent late evening dinner, got us to airport on time. It accomplished these with no charm or warmth which I don't need, but would have relished at the late hour and exhausting day I'd had.Dear Betsy B. Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay with us. We appreciate the positive and not so positive feedback you have for us. We hope that you will find time to return with your son to enjoy the pool and that we have to opportunity to serve you again - with Marriott's well know service!

"Stayed at the JW Marriott only one night since I had to travel on a Sunday, I figured I would treat myself on a work trip before heading farther out in the city for the week. I have stayed at the Marriott across the street and honestly the room is just as nice as the JW and parking is half the price. As far as the staff, everyone was friendly and I didn't have any issues. I got a nice King room on the 20th floor. The room smelled perfumey but wasn't overpowering. It was a decent size room and a big bathroom. Room was obviously done in the 90's with the green marble. Overall was a bit dated. There were some hairs on the toilet and in the shower. I find this happens because housekeepers use the same rag to wipe the whole bathroom down so instead of cleaning they just kinda move the germs and hair around. When I went to put my water in the fridge, there was a bottle of half drank juice in there from a previous guest. Also the flat screen tv is probably 8 years old and the screen is so faint you can barely watch it unless all the lights are off. The worst part was there was no hot water in the morning. Since I was about to check out there wasn't much to complain about just a bad start to the morning. The good side is since I am Platinum Elite I have lounge access. The evening dinner was delicious with lobster chowder, chicken and lasagna with assorted fruits and cheeses. Also, cookies and cupcakes for dessert. The breakfast had a good assortment of food as well. Best part of the hotel.Overall, probably wouldn't stay here again for the price unless they went through a remodel of the rooms.Thank you for your post. While I am happy you enjoyed the Executive Lounge, I am very sorry to learn about your housekeeping issues. Please be certain that I have personally followed up with our team regarding your housekeeping comments. We take all feedback very seriously so thank you for letting us know.

"The staff is great - very friendly and helpful. I paid 370 per night for my room (reservations directly with the hotel), so based on the price and other reviews, I expected a pretty nice room. I thought it was pretty dumpy. There was obvious prior water damage on the walls and ceiling, which was poorly repaired. The carpet was old and felt dirty. I made sure to wear flip flops or socks in the room. The bed was extremely hard, so I did not sleep well and woke with a sore back. The whole room, including the bathroom, was painted a dark blue-green. I did enjoy the balcony. Not sure whether to give the hotel a 2 or 3.I did not partake in much of the breakfast which consisted of a waffle station, hard boiled eggs, pastries and cereal. They did have amazing apples, oranges, peaches and plums.The location of the hotel is excellent. I really enjoy P.B. Just wish my hotel room had been better.Thank you for taking the time to write a review, Josh! We are unaware of any rooms with water damage, so we would be grateful if you would contact us and let us know which room you stayed in. Further, we're surprised with your comments regarding our carpet, as it barely a year old and constantly washed! We will look into these matters further.

"Stayed here in July booked with Travelocity. A large part of my disappoint I will blame on Travelocity, I'm pretty sure I was booking a Best Western that was 'right across' from Disneyland and with the inflated price, I was sure of it. When I arrived I of course expressed my concern to the Front Desk and they happily called the other Best Western to see if there was avail, but there was not. They very kind and down to earth front desk clerk checked us in early (9:30AM on a Monday) and we got a 1st floor room very close to the lobby, which I would actually recommend. The room: beds were pretty comfy, bed linens were soft, pillows were plentiful, towels could have been better but did the job. There was a fridge and coffee pot in the room along with a hair dryer. AC unit was a bit loud but when we came back to the room for naps, it didn't bother us one bit. I can't complain much about the room itself --nothing went wrong or was out of place. The location: Here is where I'll get picky. I would not recommend walking to the park with little ones from here. You have to cross a majorly busy intersection, then walk through the Cast Member parking lot (finally found a safe walking area inside). This will bring you to the end of Downtown Disney, from here you can either take the Monorail to Tomorrowland or walk what would be another 'block' to the Main Entrance. I would not do this at night time! Good thing is there is an ART shuttle right in front of the property. I swear by these ART shuttles, 5/day for a shuttle to the front of the parks and runs every 20 mins. Again a positive thing about our room location is that we were able to just open our room door and keep an eye out for the shuttle and then run to it. Long story short, I overpaid on Travelocity, even after considering the location mix up. But the staff is remarkable so it made up for it.",Neutral
"Parking is a serious issue there, we came back and had no parking due to stupid people taking up two parking areas, areas are extremely small as it was, night manager got busy to fix the problem, my suggestion is that each spot be numbered to the room, night manager moved his motorcycle so I could park a brand new car (week old) but my son in law had to crowd into a small area due to stupid stupid people, the next morning I learned that if there is an event across the street people park in your lot, no one should be parking there except paying customers!!!!!!! No customer should be inconvenienced at all either!!!!!! We left Bay Inn Suites up the street since it looked like a Motel 6 thrown up, that was totally misleading internet information. Again, no one should have to deal with parking their car when they are paying customer ever. Let's clean it up especially around the area by some type of vending machine or something, pretty trashy there so that next time I come it looks 100 better.We are very grateful of your feedback. Thank you for staying with us during your recent trip to San Diego.We apologize for the parking issues you experienced and we will take your suggestions into consideration. Unfortunately as we are located in a central location of such a busy city, parking is often hard to find. Many other properties in the area have begun charging a fee for parking as a solution to this dilemma. With that being said, we agree that our guests should not have trouble finding parking while staying at our accommodations. We are glad our night manager was able to help out but we will continue searching for a solution to this. We hope you consider staying with us again.",Neutral
"We stayed here whilst my husband was working and I accompanied him for a holiday. The hotel staff are lovely and extremely helpful. The room maid was a joy. The room itself as the title of the hotel suggests is a suite. Comprising lounge/study area with a fridge, coffee maker (coffee provided) and microwave. There is a desk with WiFi (fairly unreliable) and a hard wire connection (more efficient). A comfortable sofa, easy chair and flat screen TV. The bedroom follows off the lounge and we choose to have a king size bed (other options exist). Bed very comfortable, barely adequate hanging space but sufficient drawers. The bathroom was huge, lighting could be better but is ok. Other facilities include an indoor/outdoor pool with nice patio areas to relax. Pool towels freely available. Bar/Restaurant and Coffee bar is ok with a limited menu. The food we had there was fine. The area is generally hotels and a car is a must since there is very little available within walking distance. Very close to the airport and main road network. Good place to stay if you don't want to be in the thick of all the tourist attractions in Orlando, but can still reach them with ease.Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed review and especially for your charming words about our staff.

"The Nikko is different its a calm smallish hotel 1 blk from UNION Sq ... this is out 4th stay and as usual we liked the location and the rates for rooms included parking and breakfast for 2 .... We did stay the weekend before Christmas so the rates were 350 for a deluxe two queen room. I like the service here, for when we checked in I asked to see if there was an upgrade ( 2 adults 2 small children) upon getting a yes for a bigger room for 60 additional a night I was fine, however upon entering the room it seemed it was the same size as the original booking , I did call and inquire , since I din not like the room upgrade the removed the charge and let me stay in the room .... My question was I really upgraded Either way the pool is great for the kids , the breakfast for free is a asian American buffet so you will be full and the parking ( with in and out ) is 50.00 which came with the room. We like the hotel for its not crowded even though its full. The indoor pool is a nice break from the cold. The bell staff was awesome .... thanks for the help! ....The only draw back for some would be the rooms are a bit older in style .... did not bother us ....Dear DJBSFOThank you for your comments We love that you are a repeat guest.

"Suite styled hotel. Used to be another brand every few years. Stayed in same hotel under a different name 5 years ago, but different name. Hotel has not changed.Breakfast was good, and staff has been very nice and pleasant. Free ber and wine for 1 hour from 530pm - 630pm. Nice light evening meal, but nothing spectacular.Hotel corridors in summer time were over 80, and room did not drop in temperature below 76. Called front desk to complain, and was sent to offsite hotel operator who told me she couldn't do anything.Pool looks dirty, but it just is in a bad need of a resurfacing. Pool is locked at 10pm. Shuttle will drop you off for dinner, but shuts down at 7pm, so you have to pay for a cab to return to the hotel. They have free parking, so if you're driving, this is a cheaper than the hotels downtown.For the amount of money that we spent, I would have much rather stayed at a nicer hotel.Thank you for taking time to let us know about your stay here at the Hyatt house. Yes about 4 years ago the hotel went from the Bradford Suites to a Hyatt. I do appoligize about the phone system, it was originally designed to have every room with its own number so when you dial 0 you get an outside operator, because the hotel was designed more as an extended stay property. We are in the process of upgrading the phone system so our guest will no longer have that issue. As far as the AC we have since gotten the hallway units replaced and I can say it feela so much better. Our rooms have a senor controled T Stat, trying to be more energy aware. I hope that the next time you are in Dallas you will come by and see the changes.Thank you again for the welcomed comments,Jeff JonesGeneral Manager",Neutral
"We wanted a place near Mission Bay and often go to Best Westerns. This was far more expensive than the price range indicated on Google Maps, but maybe we looked in the wrong place to get a good price. This is a basic motel with a NICE breakfast. I brought a tray back to our room with a nice variety of edibles, and two good coffees. Our room was clean and cool. The AC had a new setting for us: Dry. It kept the room nice and not humid, and it was quiet, too. We had a King bed with a mini-fridge and microwave. The Desk area had plenty of outlets for charging gadgets. The bed area could use more outlets for things like CPAP machines. (We went and bought an extension cord.) The sink area had a large counter surface, and the bath area was nice sized with a shower over the tub. Staff was courteous and efficient. The pool is small and was well used.

"I do a good share of traveling and stayed here as a last minute situation. With the 405 night gouge, they really like taking advantage of weary travelers. The don't accept AAA or any other type of discount. The best part of the room was the view of the boardwalk, but everything else was very average or below average for hotel accommodations.Thank you for your feedback. Our prices are not meant to take advantage of weary travelers by any means. In fact, our rates are priced very strategically so we are neither the most expensive, nor the most affordable, property here in Pacific Beach. We set our rates so that we can confidently say that we offer the most value in town - no other property offers as many complimentary amenities and/or as affordable amenities as we do.That being said, room prices on the beach are generally higher than elsewhere because our location is simply unbeatable. Not only is our location unbeatable in San Diego, but there are very few properties situated like ours in all of Southern California.Lastly, prices during peak seasons, like spring break, will always be higher with the higher demand. We're disappointed you didn't find value in your stay with us, but you may find what you're looking for if you try again during the off-season when our rates go as low as 109!Thanks again.",Neutral

"For the price, around 70 a night, it was average. The room had been somewhat remodeled with new bedding, wallpaper, furniture and drapes. The rooms are very small and tight with two beds.

"This is a great hotel, if all you're going to do is sleep there and then be out and about in the French Quarter the rest of the day. The bed was comfy, the rooms were fairly quiet (in June--I have no idea how crazy it gets during Mardi Gras), everything was clean, and the water-pressure in the shower was good. Oh, and the service was great--very, very friendly. And as everyone else notes, it is indeed walking distance to just about anything in the French Quarter or downtown.I would definitely have rated it five stars/excellent, if it weren't for two things, each of which lose it a star:First, to get to our room, we had to walk through the outdoor courtyard. That by itself would be fine, except the courtyard was where everyone went to smoke, and smoke they did. I really don't appreciate having to sacrifice my lungs just to get to my room. They should make the entire property non-smoking.Second, having read the other reviews here about making sure to get a room with a window, we paid extra for a room with a Courtyard or City View. The room we got had nothing of the sort. It did have a window, but that window was elevated at least five feet off the ground and only had a view of the roof of the building next-door. It was fine for us (we just wanted some natural light), but it was definitely not what we reserved.So to sum up: great hotel, just be prepared to inhale some second-hand smoke and don't expect to actually look out your window. (But you're in NOLA! Go outside and see the city instead of looking out your window!)Thank you for sharing your feedback about the French Market Inn, we appreciate your kind words about our staff service and central French Quarter location. We do our best to place our guests in accommodations that meet or exceed their expectations, and apologize that you were disappointed - due to the nature of our historic property, we have a level of variance in our room types. If our employees are alerted to an accommodation issue, we are happy to switch rooms when availability exists. Please know that all of your comments have been passed on to management, we look forward to welcoming you back for your next NOLA getaway.",Neutral
"My husband was staying in this hotel for a bushiness trip. His work had selected it because its a long term stay setup. I found it clean and well located. There is a grocery store and restaurants within walking distance. The room had a small kitchenette and small eating area. The hotel is not overly fancy and does not have a lot of perks like a gym or pool. But its clean and located near the Perimeter mall. The area was also great for walking around and seemed pretty safe.I would like to personally thank you for taking time out to write such wonderful things about your experience at Homestead Atlanta - Perimeter. Our hotel is totally committed to the satisfaction of every guest who walks through our doors, which is why it is so rewarding to get feedback like yours it tells us that we are delivering on that commitment. We strive to provide a home away from home experience for all of our guests, no matter if they are staying for a night, a week, or a month. It sounds like we were able to do just that for you, and we are truly honored for your recognition. Once again, I and the entire staff at our hotel thank you for your very kind words, and we'd love to see you here again. Please don't hesitate to call on me for your future stays here or at any other Extended Stay Hotels(sm) location.",Neutral

"We stayed here for two nights. Staff was friendly. Close to Fairgrounds for Jeep Show. Room was clean but sparse. No clock or shampoo but for the price we had a nice stay. No U tums on route 30, therefore not the easiest to get to.",Neutral
"The good: The guys at the front desk were great. Attentive, full of information, courteous and smiling. The room (407) was quiet during the night. A free breakfast is always a plus. The coffee in the room was ok. Complimentary water. Bigger frig and TV. A free outlet next to the bed! The price. Good location. Village Inn next door.The bad: uh oh. What's that on the floor Housekeeping left a little souvenir behind. Don't bother paying more for executive room. Small room with only toilet and small shower in bathroom. Sink outside bathroom. Bright parking lot light at night. Told by one employee when I called the hotel that Sea World had fireworks at night so made special requests for Sea World facing room. They didn't. Breakfast eggs were of the powdered kind. No yogurt. (But then again, I can't complain - it was satisfactory and free.) Pool was basically bordered by parking lot. (Nobody used it during my stay.) No shopping within walking distance. I've stayed in new BW Plus hotels and this is not a Plus. Probably wont stay here again. If you found my review helpful, please click on yes. Thanks.",Neutral
"We travelled from Pal Springs to San Diego as part of our road trip.The hotel is nice midrange and comfortable. It has a pool.but it is small as is the patio area. However.most guests are probably not coming for the pool. It's location is good.overall in terms of seeing San Diego but is surrounded by building work so is noisy day and night. The staff were friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast is included and you can.park on site for a daily fee which is v handy.We went to old San Diego whichnis lovely and well worth a visit.

"Despite booking the room type that you think you are getting online, you may find out that the room looks nothing like what you see in the pictures and what is described. The hotel is newer, in a great location and parking is more affordable than most hotels. If the room type is something that you look for in booking a hotel, then my suggestion is go in with low expectations. Hello!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. While we have a number of different room configurations, all of the photographs on our website are taken here at the hotel and are of the specific room types they advertise.

"We travelled fron San Francisco to San Diego at similarly priced hotels and this is my first average review. The beach is beautiful and the location of the hotel is just one short block from the beach. You are charged for Wifi, the breakfast is pastry and coffee tea with creamora, the rooms are dated, and the air- conditioning is noisy. We just used the fan since the nights were cool to drown out the noise. I have stayed at other dated hotels with no air-conditioning, maybe I expected more. They did have complimentary parking and the bathrooms were clean. There was also a pool but when you have an ocean steps away, why botherYes, I guess a few of our rooms are dated, but they will all be new by this time next year, and we have already renovated about half. Each room is different when it comes to a/c noises, and we try to keep up with repairs for the big compressors we have located in our back alley. I hope you will try us again the next time you are here in San Diego. Also, our rates are very competitive in the off-season. Thank you!",Neutral
"I booked our accommodation in December 2011 for April 2012. You would have thought I would have gotten what I asked for (2 rooms side by side). When we arrived we were told we would not be on the same floor as someone who had just fronted at reception was given one of our rooms. I protested and they relented but our rooms were not side by side but quite a distance from each other. This was not good enough. The rooms themselves were nice and the hotel very good. Did have a problem with other guests walking past our door in the early morning and talking rather loudly - enough to wake us up. Also the car park directly underneath the rooms was not good. Motorbikes revving early morning is bad. Good to have computers available to guests. Breakfast was a definite bonus, with alot of variation. Would we stay again - maybe, but would look at other options.",Neutral

"We booked a 2 queen bed room and were given one with 1 queen bed which seemed like a dungeon. The room looked out onto a brick wall on the ground floor at the back of the hotel - it was awful, very depressing. Asked to be moved and got a lovely room at the front of the hotel on the 6th floor. Apart from that the hotel was good. A bit of a walk to the centre but not too bad. The staff very very helpful and friendly.",Neutral

"This is a nice hotel. It is located in the back of the French Quarter so it's not too loud. Overall experience was nice. My only issue is the parking rate. There was no information regarding a parking fee during booking. Parking is 20-30 per day. I had to pay almost 100 just for parking, and was also billed 100 for incidental fees which is refunded after check out. Kind of a bummer on a trip where these were additional fees.Dear Shuwanda, I am glad you enjoyed our hotel during your stay. I apologize for the confusion on the hotel parking fee's.

"I stayed at the Orchard Garden last month, as business took me to San Francisco and there were literally no other hotel rooms available downtown between 75 and 450 per night some huge conference was going on and there was NO hotel availability. So I chose this hotel out of necessity (as I really had no choice), but was pleasantly surprised during my stay. The hotel is green, which I appreciate. Biodegradable bath product packaging (although the products themselves are still full of chemicals, boo), room key controlled lighting (very European), etc. The bathroom floor was heated (huge bonus in the morning) and the room was spacious enough. My view was of another close building, so that left a bit to be desired, and my room smelled of old lady perfume a little. I wasn't able to check out the rooftop garden but heard from a colleague that it's a great spot when the weather is nice. This hotel probably isn't my first choice for future trips to SF, as it was farther from my office than I'd like and I have other favorite hotels in the city, but it's definitely doable and I would stay here again if need be.Thank you for sharing your experience during your recent visit to San Francisco and our Hotel. Im thrilled you were pleasantly surprised during your stay and truly appreciate your feedback. Although it seems you enjoyed a majority of your stay, I am sincerely sorry about the lingering smell of the perfume. All of us here at the Orchard Garden Hotel would love if you decided to stay with us again. Thanks again Quinn McEntee Front Office Manager",Neutral
"I stayed overnight at the Fairfield Inn Philadelphia Airport hotel recently to attend an event nearby which started early in the morning. The room was quiet as requested and included a safe, coffee maker, refrigerator (which was a surprise), flat screen TV, hair dryer, alarm clock, and complimentary WiFi which connected right away. The room and bathroom were immaculate except for a gum wrapper in the nightstand drawer. The clerk at check in was a bit abrupt when I asked about getting airline miles with the room (he didn't answer my question) but the clerk at check out was very friendly. A Ruby Tuesday restaurant is right across the parking lot. The complimentary breakfast buffet included cereal, sausage, muffins, bagels, yogurt, scrambled eggs, and sliced fruit. I would definitely consider this hotel the next time I travel to the Philly area.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us. We are glad we were able to meet your request, and you were happy with the accommodations. We look forward to seeing you again next time you travel to Philadelphia.",Neutral
"I traveled to Ritz Central Park for my 50th Birthday celebrations with my Mother and my Daughter.... we had this planned for approximately 9 months....Upon arrival we were very impressed with the hotel lobby. Whilst checking in I didnt feel the usual Ritz welcome service I had experienced in other Ritz Hotels. We made our way up to a very pleasant room with a Cava chilling and selection of chocolates and a birthday card welcome which was a lovely touch to the start of our vacation. Our room was not quite ready as the put up bed had not been set up, our arrival was approximately 8pm so I would have thought this would have been done. We hit the shops ( Black Friday). On returning to the hotel all was done. We continued to enjoy our stay at the Ritz which an amazing setting in an ideal location. The doormen where very attentive as we were in and out and nothing was to much trouble for them.Getting ready to go out on Sunday evening I realised an item of jewellery was missing. Security initially could not do enough and we were given access to Club Lounge as we needed to hang around the hotel more than we wanted to to help with investing the incident. Not ideal when we only had a 5 day stay. However, after 24 hours and the item was never found I felt like we were under suspicion. We never heard anything from Security again. Police took statements. On arrival back to the UK we have had to contact Ritz to find out any outcome of their investigation and are still no further on. Overall staying at Ritz Hotels is amazing experience but this particular stay did not make me feel like a valued customer....",Neutral
"Although the hotel was reasonably priced, our shower had mildew in it, and the place was run-down. The staff was friendly, and the outdoor pool was in pretty good shape, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel for more than a brief stay -- there are better options in this price range.",Neutral
"I've stayed at this hotel three times since 2008.Value. Especially during Mardi Gras, when this area is near parade routes, but even at other times, this hotel is more expensive than the Best Western St. Christopher (on the edge of the French Quarter). I think the biggest difference between the two is the location that you prefer. I don't want to pay more to stay in the Garden District, but I could think of people who would.Rooms. These are a little smaller than normal and don't have work desks or in-room safes. My room faced the parking lot behind the hotel and was fairly quiet. On previous visits I didn't have a problem with noise either. I love the room decor which is bright and contemporary. It looks better than most BWs I've visited. Also, there is an extra sink next to the closet space near the door, which works well when there are multiple people in a room.Location. It is on St. Charles with a streetcar stop almost in front of the hotel. St. Charles and its nearby areas have more good restaurants than the French Quarter IMO and the streetcar is an incredibly efficient way of getting to them. Also, the French Quarter is not walking distance from the hotel, but the streetcar takes you to Canal Street, which is the border of the Quarter. The hotel is also quite close to Loyola and Tulane Universities as well as Audubon Park/Zoo. This particular area of St. Charles is residential. It should be noted that part of the hotel is built on top of a restaurant, Superior Grill. This is convenient, but it enhances the possibility for noise. It hasn't bothered me, but I've never been in a room directly over it.Cleanliness. The room was reasonably clean. I was there for a half-marathon and spent more time than normal in the bathroom to ice my legs. I noticed that the bathroom wasn't exactly spotless, but it wasn't anything you'd notice unless you spent 30-45 minutes in there looking around. Service. The front desk staff struck me as nice, but in a couple of cases simply weren't able to accommodate me. I arrived around 3:15PM and my room was not ready. Since the hotel was fully booked, they couldn't give me another room. I waited in the lobby for a little more than an hour and two calls by the clerk to the housekeeper and my room still wasn't ready. The clerk agreed to hold my bag while I went next door to Superior Grill to eat dinner. I returned about 6:30PM and my room was ready. I was not the only person waiting for a room. (Throughout my stay, I noticed that housekeeping seemed to occur late in the day, about 1-4 PM. It wasn't difficult to notice because the housekeeper on our floor blasted music in the rooms she was cleaning.) Second, I asked the front desk for some information about street closures occurring that weekend and they weren't aware of them. It's a relatively minor issue, but there were multiple people asking and they never got answers.Sleep Quality. My room was quiet and the bed relatively decent.Notes. The surface on the second floor slopes a bit which can feel weird initially. They have a bookshelf with books for guests to read while there.",Neutral

"First the positive - check in was a breeze, the room was in great condition, it was quiet, the air conditioning was great, the breakfast was good, there's food nearby although many places don't stay open very late, they even provide mouthwash with the free toiletries which was a nice touch, they welcome their HHonors members very well, had nice 12 shuttle to the port, and the free airport shuttle was prompt when called.Now the problem - they tried to kick us out of our a room a day early. They didn't even tell us, they just gave someone else a keycard that gave them access to our room. Thankfully we were there when they tried to gain entry so we were able to stop them. The other guest went back to the lobby and the front desk called us and told us we weren't supposed to be there and to get out. I explained that I had booked for 2 days. They accused me of lying so I offered to present proof of my reservation, they put me on hold and when they eventually came back they accused me of checking out a day early. I told them that was clearly untrue since I was still in the room. They muttered an apology and hung up on me. If it hadn't been for this one interaction I would have rated them excellent but given that they put our safety and property at risk and made accusations that were untrue I simply can't rate them better than average. It was one thing but the severity was too serious. They didn't do anything to make up for it. I mentioned it in the survey they sent me but there was no follow-up.",Neutral

Our room was clean, quiet, good size, with a microwave and refrigerator. We were in the third building on the parking lot side and did not have street noise. There is a guest laundry, nice pool area, plenty of free parking, a good complimentary breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful.

Then I was offered a room which I had not requested, and they repeated that I should've called to make sure my request was duly noted. I was surprised that I was at fault, by not calling them to ask for a room.But this was not enough to mark my stay. I left the make the room light on cause I wanted to come back and catchup on my sleep deprivation and left to go to my breakfast and then to meetings and returned at 4PM to find the room unmade! I called and asked the room to be made. They came up, and actually noticed the light to make the room and I asked if they acted on the light or not. They indicated to me it was best to call.

"The hotel is clean and the rooms are modern. Price is reasonable. Location is close to Universal but a very busy intersection. Lost a couple of stars due to the following:1) Shuttle is overbooked and was never available for us to use since it was always sold out. The booking system does not require you to identify yourself, I believe many people overbook. The shuttle serves at least 4 hotels so a 5 minute trip ends up being 30 minutes to the park and is part of the reason the shuttle was sold out.2) Breakfast was mediocre and very crowded. Same items every day with little or no variety. By the 4th day we went to IHOP. Very crowded at times.3) While hotel staff were helpful, the service staff for the shuttle tickets were not. Service was poor and they were mostly interested in selling or up-selling park tickets. Frustrating to wait in line every morning behind many people buying tickets only to find out that the shuttle was sold out for the day.4) This seems picky but wi-fi was slow and spotty. Non-secured wi-fi usually is.We've stayed in far worse but we'll try another hotel next time as there are a lot of good choices in the area.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your stay with us. We are glad that you liked our rooms and location but we apologize that you had difficulty with the shuttle service. Unfortunately during peak seasons the shuttles fill up quickly. It is possible to book your shuttle the day before your departure for the parks which would help to guarantee a seat. The ticket desk you are referring to is operated by Universal as are the shuttles to Universal. There are several departures each morning, but we realize during this busy month the early departures sold out quickly. Another option is to ask the front desk to call a cab which is only 8.00 and will get you to the park quickly. Parking at Universal can be difficult during high season as well and will cost 17.00 so a cab is sometimes the best option. We hope that you will visit us again.",Neutral

"I recently stayed at the Best Western Hacienda for the week, and I cannot rave enough about the great location of the hotel. Located right in the heart of Old Town San Diego, there are great Mexican restaurants and shopping right outside your door. Unfortunately, the location is the only thing I would rate as Excellent.The rooms were a bit out of date, they could definitely use some updates, especially in the decor-area. The rooms were very, very dark. Not what I would expect in sunny San Diego.I believe my room was especially noisy. I stayed in the 700 building which backs up to the restaurants on the main street. Every morning at 5:30, the garbage truck would back up outside my window and unload the dumpster. Even on Sundays. I also had an adjoining room to a family of four. I could hear every single thing through the door between our rooms, including bathroom noises (not to be too graphic...)We also booked our rooms with the El Presidente package. It entitled us to a free breakfast and free dinner (with two free drinks). The breakfast was decent, especially the days when they had French Toast which was really good. The dinners were okay, with a very limited menu. We chose to eat in town quite a few nights and pass up the free dinners. Strangely, being a part of the El Presidente package also seemed to limit where you were allowed to sit in the restaurant. It would have been nice to eat outside.Overall, I think the hotel is a good value. The location is great and within walking distance of a lot of great sites. I probably would not recommend the hotel if you planned on staying indoors all day!",Neutral

Nice hotel. Strange sewer like smell upon arrival in the hall and elevator but did dissipate. In need of new carpet in major walkways outside of the room. Room was standard.

Outrageous Price Gouging. First of all this hotel is an 89 a night at best. My rate went from 149 on the first night to 199 on for night 2 to 269 on night 3. You be the judge. I am a platinum member that obviously means nothing. Room are not bad but need updates.,Neutral
"Stayed at Rancho Bernardo Hilton Garden Inn for recent business trip. Hotel was adequate - staff was pleasant, rooms were clean and in good shape, lobby was fine for sitting and having a drink.

"The hotel itself is pretty nice, with a cool bar downstairs and a lovely staff. The building is quite old and the elevator was extremely small, so for people with claustrophobia it will be very difficult. When we approached the room we smelled a very odd and a bit gross smell, almost like urine. We where told that we where going to get a more spacious and bigger room, but when we saw the room i did wonder what a normal room would look like, because it was not big. There was a lot of dust on the floor and it almost looked like it had not been cleaned properly! We found black hair in the shower and it did not look appealing to take a shower. The next day when we came back to the room later, the dust and the hair was gone... the air condition was very load and where put right next to the bed near the window, so the person lying there would have trouble sleeping at night. The hotel is very close to union square and it took only a couple of minutes to walk. The staff was helpful and nice, which we appreciated a lot! The library bar near the lobby was very cool and the music there was amazing!Hotel Rex was very expensive! But I guess that is the price in san franscico, especially for a hotel near the union square..Hello651, thank you so much for staying with us and kind words about our staff. I do invite you to come back in January as we are going through a full renovation. Cheers and safe travels.",Neutral
"We were in San Francisco for 6 days, and we stayed at the Monarch.They were nice enough to check us in early,but the room had a slight smell and a view of the apartment that was 10 feet away. The bed was clean,but the pillows really really flat,and I am not a pillow person.It was cold in the room so bring warm socks(this was in Aug), warm pajamas and a pillow.The washrooms were clean and the bathtub deep.The safe did not work and if the temp.outside was hot,we would be in trouble,because it the AC was missing knobs.The tv had 15 channels and HBO( a few great movies).The Wi-Fi worked and the morning coffee was good. The biggest problem was that the area was loud at night with the homeless and druggies talking/yelling until 1am.In the morning the homeless were very visable and at night,I would not want to be coming in late if you are on your own.

"Christmas with Family. Best Western Yacht Hotel was in a convenient location to visit family. We keep making the mistake of booking hotels that offer free breakfast, which we immediately regret when we sample breakfast. Brown-crusted scrambled eggs cold and greasy tater tots.

"This was our first stay at this resort. We stayed at Westin KOR last year and loved it, so decided to give it a try.We booked a 1 week stay through an owner on redweek. He was wonderful - very helpful in linking our 2 extra nights though the resort so we wouldnt have to move. He did tell me he had requested one of the bldg 8 high floor one bedrooms 1 year in advance, as these have the best view. When I checked in the front desk told me since I wasnt an owner and elite member I did not get preference and I was l placed in a 5th floor room in bldg 7 facing the courtyard and other rooms. They moved us mid stay to bldg 8, but through this I came to find out there are very few 1 bedrooms and they all have poor views or face the pool where loud noise can be heard until late evening. So, if you are looking to book a 1 bedroom beware. Youre better off at KOR where there are ocean front and ocean view 1 bedrooms. Many at Nanea face the parking structure. That being said the rooms are new and well appointed. The shower in the the 1 bedroom was not great... tub with curtain. At KOR they have the nice walk in rain shower, double sinks and a large tub.We did come here the week of Spring break, so expected it to be busy, but it was a bit on the insane side. The pool was packed everyday and seemed over crowded. They seemed under staffed as it was difficult to find a server on the pool deck and it was much faster to go to the bar and order. The other thing we noticed was the lack of cleanliness of the place. Trash everywhere, no one emptying the overflowing trash cans. The lounge chairs were pretty filthy, clearly not wiped down. The beach here is nice, but as others have noted, smaller and rockier than at KOR. We did enjoy snorkeling off the beach everyday with little kids. The waves are gentle and great for learning. We also had spectacular whale action everyday.End game, even though its older we preferred KOR and will book there in the future. Aloha baflier,E kala mai. We apologize for not meeting your expectations. On a personal note, we agree the loyal Elite 5 owner who hosted your stay is wonderful and it was a pleasure assisting him in linking your reservations and providing a room move option for you and your family during your stay.

"Firstly, the staff were great, no issues there. Extremely friendly and attentive.My primary concerns had to do with the room appointments. I felt like the hotel had undergone a fairly recent conversion but more work towards soundproofing and modernization is in order. I stayed in a Junior Suite and I'm 6'1 and I felt like a giant in this room.The bathroom was very, very small. There were no vents or fans in the bathroom so moisture buildup was a definite issue. The room furniture while stylish was very low to the floor and not so functional or comfortable if you are taller.I slept in the murphy bed and I felt like it would have really benefitted from a good pillow-top pad addition, it was quite uncomfortable. The floors were very creaky and we could hear our adjoining neighbor's conversations quite clearly in the room.Also, there is a small inside courtyard but it's not accessible to any of the guests and rooms on this side are probably quieter but they are darker.Many of the guests (my party included) noticed that the elevators didn't indicate whether they were going up or down until you were in the elevator having selected the floors and it resulted in some unexpected travels. Valet parking is pricey at 40/night and they recommend calling about 30 mins before you need to leave and I'd heed that advice.At this hotel's price point, my expectations start to rise and while this hotel is an ok value for San Francisco, I think a little tweak here and there would go a long way in making this a solid mid-range hotel in Downtown SF.Dear Lightning79,Thank you for sharing your comments on Trip Advisor.

"I've stayed at other Fairfield Inns and my overall experience has been good. If you're looking for a very basic, nice hotel, this is a good one. But, there are a few caveats. The room was cold, and the bedding is extremely minimal - just a sheet and a very light cover. Upon requesting a couple of extra blankets, I was told that they weren't sure they had any. Luckily, a nice gentleman showed up at the door with blankets a few minutes later. Although the sign in the bathroom says that if you hang up your towels you can help the hotel to be green by not washing and replacing them every day, this wasn't the case. Each and every day, there were new towels. Also, the toiletries were never replenished, so I had to request more. On the last night of my stay, I discovered a silverfish and an ant on the bathroom floor. This might suggest that the hotel do a little more cleaning to prevent this type of incident in the future.I used the hotel's shuttle to go to the airport Marriott location for dinner one night. This was a very convenient option, and the driver was very nice and accommodating.The breakfast was great (breakfast sandwiches, waffles, fruit, oatmeal, etc,) and service was extremely friendly!Hello,Thank you very much for taking the time to provide your feedback.

"This is one of the hotels our company uses for our Dallas airport stays, so we stay here about four times a month. I have mixed feelings. In general, I like the rooms a lot. They are clean and have fairly modern finishes. They have a good sized kitchenette with a large refrigerators, however, many of them are broken. Instead of fixing them, they have placed a lot of small fridges in the room as well, but not all, so if you need a fridge check to see if it works after checking into your room. Also, a lot of the rooms have Air conditioners that don't work properly, this is a big problem in Dallas in the summertime. On my last stay, two nights ago, I had one of theses rooms with a faulty A/C unit and broken fridge. The A/C seemed to work in the first hour, so I unpacked all my things and it was late in the evening, about 11pm. By the time I noticed it started to get very hot in the room it was too late to pack up all my things ( I had an extremely long work day and was exhausted ). I called the front desk and no one answered the first call even though I let it ring for awhile. I tried back and a very surly man answered like he was very bothered and annoyed. I told him the A/C wasn't working and also the fridge was broken. Silence. I could almost here the 'So, what do you want me to do about it' in his thoughts! After an awkward silence, he said to hold on. He then sent someone up to change my room which I declined because of the time and effort. That same night checking in, there was a different clerk who seemed um, medicated let's say, she was very harried and distracted and had trouble checking a two of us in, she couldn't seem to get her thoughts straight, it was pretty strange. I would hope they could get their staff to act in a more professional manner. I have to say their shuttle drivers are awesome, very prompt and friendly. Maybe they should put the shuttle drivers behind the front desk and make the front desk clerks the shuttle drivers Just an idea.",Neutral
"This property is a very typical Marriott with capable staff (aside from housekeeping) and nicely finished interiors. I have stayed here twice within a month and both experiences were pleasant, especially their marketing director (Peggy, I believe her name was) whom I met in the lobby. She went out of her way to find information for my colleagues and I to make our visit exceptional. However, housekeeping staff requires some further training on how and when to enter a room. Apparently my Do Not Disturb sign had fallen out of the card reader. At 8 am sharp while I was still soundly asleep I awoke to a scratching sound at the door, followed by her abrupt attempt at entry. She was unable to get in because of the metal flap safety device, and yelled. I asked her to come back later (preferably, after I checked out an hour later) and received a snotty sigh of disgust in return. Slleping in one's paid hotel room is not too much to ask.",Neutral
"On a recent trip to San Diego we booked online at this hotel. On arrival we found that what we had booked was not available. We had booked a king suite for 2 nights and they had us down for 2queen beds for only one night, after some discussion with the front desk a second night was arranged in the same room. Each evening on our return to the hotel we found that our key cards did not work, normally this is not a big deal but this hotel is not like others we have stayed at we're all of the rooms are in the same building. The rooms in this hotel are all in different buildings so a lot of walking is required. Our room was in building 400 facing the rear of a restaurant and each morning we were woke by garbage trucks around 5am. On our last evening there we tried several vending machines to get a bottle of Pepsi but all were out of service , so we went to the fron desk to ask if there was any way to get a bottle and we were told to drive to a store somewhere ourselves to pick it up. The person on the desk was very rude about it. All in all the location was great but the service and the noise outside are room was terribl. On our last morning at breakfast all of the dishes were dirty.We are disheartened to read your review.

"I stayed two nights at Hotel Felix - the room was a bit small but the bed was large and comfortable. The lighting in my room was at the end of the bed, so the far end of the room was a little dim, I had to turn the desk lamp on to see my suitcase. Also, some of the spotlights in the ceiling above the bed were not aligned with their hole (they had come loose and left a gap) which didn't help the lighting situation. The rest of the room was ok for a short stay but any longer and it could be a little uncomfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful and it's ideally located. You're only a few minutes walk from the L train stations. The bar and restaurant options in the hotel are quite limited - you have to go next door to the local bar for a drink and the lobby doubles as a sushi bar. I'd recommend if you're in town for a short stay or business but not for a longer visit.Hi Knoggers - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our urban location, and that our friendly staff was able to assist you. We appreciate your feedback and we hope to see you again soon. Safe travels.",Neutral
"Made reservations at the last minute for New Year's eve and it was clearly 20 cheaper for similar hotels in the area. Clean, digital tv. Older style heater/air-conditioner combination controlled by a high/low thermostat rather than temp. It worked fine. Even though next to the freeway, didn't hear a thing in the room.",Neutral
"New, clean and mostly friendly staff. The pool is not big enough for the resort and want that inviting. Kaanapali and the Resort Spa are better pools. It is says you can share facilities between the Westin properties and Sheraton. That is incorrect. You can not use the pools at Sheraton or Resort Spa which was awkward arriving thinking you could. Pool staff confirmed they get this situation happening all the time. Room service shuts down at 8pm. Crazy for an international brand! When we arrived we struggled to find something to eat.Aloha andrewgemmell,And mahalo for your comment. We are sad to hear your stay was not to your complete satisfaction. We have addressed your concerns regarding pool usage information at the other Starwood properties to our director of guest experience and also spoke with our food and beverage management team in relation to in-room dining hours. Please accept our apologies on the shortcomings you have experienced. We do appreciate your feedback and your experience is important to us.

"We had room for seven but at what price, the breakfast was not good, the placement of the air conditioner had the air blowing on the beds most of the night or you shut it off and it was so hot you died of heat. The one air conditioner was making the floor wet and when I told the lady at the front desk she looked at me like she knew and did not care.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel. We sincerely appreciate your feedback and we're very sorry you were unhappy. I know how frustrating the air conditioning issue must have been for you. I will speak to the staff personally to ensure that all notes are recognized when being left by our guest. We will take your comments under consideration as we continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us in the future.",Neutral
"This was a very inexpensive hotel my coworker and I booked, not knowing the status of the area.The staff was friendly, which helps when realizing what sort of neighborhood it's located in.The pros: it's a cheap hotel, the Bart transit subway is not too far of a walk. Busses are on all surrounding streets. You're surrounded by many different restaurants of all varieties of ethnic and American foods.The rooms are large and the beds are comfy. The room thermostats don't work well so good luck with controlling your room temperature.Ice machine is in the garage but easy to get to.The ConsElevators are slow.The rooms are extremely thin so, if you don't mind noise and traffics orchestras, then you're good. Don't book here if you want silence or scenic views.It's an area of vagrants, homeless, and transients that may make you wary of wanting to wander around in the evenings. It didn't bother me but I could see it for those who can't handle it.I can sleep through anything so, I was at home.The WIFI works and I've not had problems doing work. Hot water is great when taking a shower.If I had a choice to stay here again, I'm might, but make it the last resort.Walgreens is only a block up to get last minutes sundries. Several coffee shops are available, and there are close nearby markets to get beer or cigs.None of the vagrants ever bothered me and I did not feel unsafe like a few of the other reviews I've read prior to booking.I did feel that this hotel can be better if the owners took some money and time to repaint, upgrade the plug in outlets, and added some affordable bathroom upgrades. More importantly, you're in SF, let this place be where you sleep, and enjoy the wonderful city.:)",Neutral
"Allegro was not really what I expected. Rooms hallways were dull, drab and darkish. Bathrooms were extremely small, had to remove the garbage can to move around without tripping over it. Bar/Lounge area was just average. Not a lot of sitting area, if there's a large group. Bar tenders were nice. For the price I did expect more. Location was however good, as it was towards central downtown, and many thing were within walking distance, minuets from the rail-train. If you are into Old Historical Hotel, this may be the hotel for you, but I'm not.Because this was a business trip, and I did spend very little time in the hotel and room, it was average. If on vacation would definitely choose a more modern Hotel.Thanks for taking time to review your stay with us. I'm disappointed to see you did not enjoy your stay with us. As we are in a historic 1920's building, we aimed to put a modern twist on the classic art deco decor of that era, however we understand not everyone can appreciate that style, however I'm glad to see you were able to take advantage of our excellent location. Thanks again for providing feedback from your stay and safe travels in the future.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager",Neutral
"As part of our honeymoon we stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 6 days. New York was amazing as always and the location of the hotel is just great, just of Central Park South. Initially we were given the wrong room and, despite having been in contact with the customer service manager up front (both regarding the honeymoon and the fact we are platinum members) our special requests were not followed up.But, upon contacting the front desk on these points, the Ritz Carlton staff made every effort in giving us a great stay and provided us with complimentary drinks and dinner.The fact the overall score comes to average is noy only due to the disappointment while checking in, but also due to the fact that the Ritz prices are high. And the overall customer experience you get in return is just not up to par. The rooms are nice, but small and in need for remodelling. As are the hallways and some of the public spaces. Furthermore we would have expected more qualified staff as well. At slightly lower rates we would have given the Ritz a score of 4. But, again, good hotel in a great location. Oh and by the way, the beds are simply devine.Dear Sjors257,Thank you for your feedback and please accept my deepest apology as the image of our hotel was not up to your expectation. I regret that you left with a completely negative impression of our hotel and please know that regaining your trust and faith in our hotel is very important to us.

"We found the Baymont Inn Suites through the list of Wyndham family of hotels, since we are Wyndham Rewards members and were looking to increase our points. Since we only needed a room for one night (less than 12 hours total) and for us and our 2 kids, we didn't need much, but they had a King suite with two rooms and a hideaway. This suited our needs. Unfortunately, the end result wasn't worth the money we paid for the room.To begin, the hotel is situated immediately next door to a local Mexican restaurant, and we got the feeling the hotel staff and the restaurant staff hang out often together in the hotel lobby or near the front desk when business is slow. There seemed to be a definite camaraderie with friendly conversation taking place when I checked in. To be fair, it was after 11pm when we arrived, and I know this changes the look and feel of a property.Checkin was smooth and easy and our room was in the main building on the 2nd floor. No elevators, though, so we had to lug 3 large suitcases and our 4 carry-on bags upstairs and down the hall without a cart. Also, just past the front desk and before the stairs there was a small room with a glass window and open door full of miscellaneous boxes, materials, and other paraphernalia, giving it a haphazard appearance.Once we arrived at our room, the key showed green but the door wouldn't open. We learned we needed to turn the handle up instead of down due to a low-battery keyed entrance.From the pictures on the web site, the rooms appeared much larger than they really are. Main room had mini-fridge, microwave on a counter, 2 chairs and a hideaway couch right next to each other, and a single dresser on which the TV sat, all in close proximity with not much room to move once the bed was unfolded. The entrance into the king bedroom was an opening which looked like they took duplicate rooms and cut a hole in the wall, because it was a mirror-reflection of the main room. The only difference is there was a closet area with no door and a king bed. No extra pillows or blankets, and the pillows on the king bed immediately flattened, thereby lacking support. The bed itself was quite hard and unforgiving.The rooms were clean, and the windows had nice treatments, but the lacks in other areas overshadowed that. If you're looking for an affordable stay with sufficient continental breakfast and basic amenities, this place would work. Plus, there are Wyndham Rewards points for your stay!",Neutral
"This is my second stay at this location and due to it's price of under 100.00 it fits my budget. On my first stay the room was spotless, unfortunately this time around I can see that they just ripped out the old TV's because there is particle board shaving from the entertainment center all over the furniture and part of the carpet...the good news is brand new flat screen..the bad news is that the front desk told me that there were no remote controls for the new HDTV's and you could not change the channels...it was programmed on the welcome screen. So the rooms are worn with sagging couches nicked and torn wall paper, old furniture and brand new HDTV's that are useless...I think I'll look elsewhere on my next business trip to San Diego. I am a Platinum Choice Hotels member and stayed over 25 nights with Comfort Suites across the Western US last year and this is not the standard of every other CS I have stayed at..this should be a Comfort Inn.",Neutral
"Hotel Diva is a nice hotel, decorated nice, friendly staff, however our only complaint is that the bathrooms our to small.

"I checked into this hotel this past week for a one night stay in Philadelphia. The hotel has a GREAT central location, and is located in the heart of everything.As a Hyatt 'Diamond' member, i found this hotel very confusing. It is clearly a grand, historic property. The lobby and common areas reflect this. The hallways on the room floors are a flashback to years gone by. The bold patterned wall papers and bright green colors brought memories of the 70's and my grandmothers taste at the time. I kept thinking Jackie O. might walk around the corner at any moment.Conversely, the rooms were remodeled in a contemporary, stark style reminiscent of hotels like W. They style in one area says one thing, and then a sudden CONTRAST that was not good. The room designs were a bit cheap, cold. It was VERY odd. I had a corner 'suite', which was HUGE. I was upgraded, so i feel bad complaining....but it was a VERY odd hotel stay.It felt like they didn't have the money to tie things together by remodeling the dated corridors at the same time as the roomsIt also reminded me of one other Hyatt hotel....the Grand Hyatt Buckhead in Atlanta. This classic hotel had their lobby remodeled in a very contemporary manner that didn't match anything else in the hotel. Crazy.The service was 'OK'. My check in was fine, but trays stayed on the corridors....and several room service tables were in place for the entire 24 hours i was in the hotel. Check in was fine. I tried to eat upstairs, but got frustrated at the crowd from a wedding....and left.Elevators were slow.The hotel is clean. Its OK.... The design team should be fired guys. Really awful.Sorry....Thank you for taking the time to review our historic hotel and we hope you had a wonderful holiday season. Even more so, thank you for your loyalty to Hyatt. We completely understand what it takes to attain Diamond status and truly do appreciate your patronage to our brand. That said, it is truly disappointing to hear we did not exceed your expectations on your visit to the Bellevue. You had mentioned our current design in your review and we can certainly understand your point of view. In 2010 only our suites went under renovation thus leading to the style difference between the corridors and the room you stayed in. We are very much looking forward to a full room renovation in 4th quarter of 2015. All standard guest rooms will be renovated with a style an elegance to match this amazing historic building. Furthermore the soft goods in our suites will be replaced or refinished at this time as well. We believe this renovation will take our hotel to another level. In regards to trays left in the hallway, we have already addressed with our In Room Dining team and we will obviously look to improve in this area. Once again, thank you for you feedback, as it is crucial to our success. If you would like to talk further about your stay, please feel free to message me privately so we could arrange time.

"Nice location, nice looking hotel, but needs some sound proofing! I was in a King room just off the elevator lobby, which is marble, could hear people talking outside and in the room next to us as if they were in our room. Doors slam shut so hard we woke up every time our neighbor came in or out. Room was nice size, bed was a little hard for my taste. Great view from our 24th floor room. Don't think I would stay here again unless there is an update to the building in terms of sound proofing. Valet was overwhelmed the day we arrived (large convention in the hotel) It took a trip around the block since we drove past the line of cars waiting, and a 20 minute wait to get parked. Elevators were over taxed at busy times due to a full hotel and busy convention. Staff was great and friendly.Thank you for your recent stay at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel.

"I booked this hotel based on the great reviews it got, and that people seemed to feel like it was in a 'great location'. After staying one night, I have to disagree. I suppose if you are staying and you have a car, it probably is a good location because it's really close to the highway- but we only stayed one night, so we didn't have a car, and the location was terrible. There was nothing to do near the hotel, I am not from the area, so it was hard for me to tell if this is a 'good area' or not, but I was not about to walk around alone. Our hotel room was clean and comfortable, but we only had one working outlet in the room. All of the other outlets were a major fire hazard as they only allowed the plugs to go in half-way. Breakfast was fine, but crowded and I couldn't get the wifi to work. As we were checking out, we watched a mouse swimming around in the pool.

"I read a bunch of other reviews before I came here, so I knew the parking would be bad. Therefore, we never moved our car and it wasn't really an issue. Plus, why would anyone need to drive This hotel is literally across the street from the Disneyland gates and between the parking lot (which has a Denny's) and a three block walk (to a mall) there are at least 100 shops and restaurants. No car required! We're not Denny's people, so we had some excellent meals at the restaurants in GardenWalk. The location is amazing for the price we paid, but don't expect anything more than that. We got a major attitude from the front desk when we checked in. In response to have a nice day the front desk agent responded with I'll try. Not exactly the response you expect from people in hospitality. The next morning we tried to get into the safe (which they charge you for regardless of whether or not you intend to use it) and, upon trying to open it, it got stuck. We spent our morning calling the front desk several times to send someone up to help us with it, who just assumed we had forgotten the key, though we explained many times the key was in there, it just wasn't working. Turns out, the door hinges were weak and the door wasn't sitting right. The maintance people said (who were very nice) said they would come back and open it again anytime we needed it, but, seeing how long it took the first time, we decided to just risk leaving our stuff out instead. Finally, breakfast. This is what brings my review down to a 3. I wasn't expecting much, but I would like more than corn flakes and stale danish if you are advertising breakfast. Also, the part that really really really bothered me: Everything is styrofoam! Every drink cup, every bowl, every plate they use is just killing the environment. Futhermore, their tiny maze of tables gets packed, but there are signs saying not to take things out of the room. Do they expect guests to sit on each others laps!!! Oh, and by 8:30, there is nothing left to eat (except corn flakes, which I had every day). This is is more frustrating by the fact that both days there was service person just sitting in there. Not sure what her job was...So, bottom line, if you're just looking for a place that is close to the park and this is the cheapest, go for it, just keep your expectations very low, plan on walking, and bring your own cups bowls. :)",Neutral

"Let me start out by saying that my buddies and I always stay at this hotel because of its location and how spacious. the room offer a lot of space and we like the fact that they have 2 bedrooms and 2 baths. the employees at the front desk were cordial and checked us in quickly. when I got up stair to the room, I immediately checked to see if the heat and hot water was working. i had read in a previous review that a guest was placed in a room that didn't have heat or hot water. I was fortunate because mine were working fine. although the maid service came in every morning to change the linen and towels, they don't dust, sweep or clean at all. fortunately for me, I travel with a can of Lysol and bought a spray bottle of bleach from the target up the street before using the tub or sink. I use the Lysol to spray down the mattress, linen in every hotel I visit, not just this one. I used the bleach to spray down the walls and tubs before utilizing them.the new dcor in the room is nice. the toilet in one bathroom shifted when a friend of mine used it. yes! the toilet actually moved while he was sitting on it. fortunately for us, there was another bathroom we could use and we did. the window in the room was broken. we opened the window but had to do some maneuvering to get it to close.the cleaning women do a deplorable job cleaning these rooms. in the room we were in, the top of the refridgerator had trash or some type of debris that should have been noticeable to the cleaning crew. also in the kitchen cabinet, there was an unused needle with an alcohol swab next to it.it they cleaned and dusted this hotel a lot better, im sure the reviews would be a lot better. this hotel is very affordable and its right in the heart of buckhead. any and everything you could possibly want is within a short distance.I would recommend travelers to stay here, just be prepared to deal with a room that is partially clean. but, is very spacious and in the heart of everything. I will, without hesitation, stay at this property again.Allow me to start by thanking you for acknowledging our front desk staff and Im very pleased to hear they were courteous and able to get you checked in expeditiously. I am however, sorry for the housekeeping issues you encountered once arriving to your room. We understand that sometimes guests feel better when they themselves do a little extra sanitizing of a room if you will, but it is our goal to make 100 sure that is never a necessity for a guest. We have spoken with our housekeeping staff and will be making the proper changes and ensure they are better trained on what needs to be done so our guests are satisfied. Thank you again for choosing to stay with us, as we know you have many options to choose from. We hope you will return again in the very near future.",Neutral
"Stayed early June for six nights and disappointed that pool was closed when I arrived and remained closed for the whole of my stay, as this was one of the reasons I choose this hotel, location being the other reason.I was then allocated a room on top floor and immediately noticed an irritating humming noise and I wondered if it might have been air con units on roof and rang down to reception. A maintenance guy came up and said that it was same on all floors - after putting up with this for two nights I checked out lower floors and found this was not the case!! I went to reception and they agreed to move me to a lower floor, which was much quieter.I have complained about these problems but response from hotel has been less than satisfactory!On the plus side the hotel is in an excellent location, five minutes walk from Amtrak station, five minutes walk from Little Italy, and less than 10 minutes walk from the Bay with all its attractions. Rooms are of a reasonable quality, with decent amenities, if a little tired. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not great but was satisfactory and plentiful and staff were pleasant.",Neutral
"The room decor is dated and somewhat shabby, but this can be overlooked given the room cost and location. The Inn is within walking distance to shops and restaurants on Union Street and Fort Mason. You can get to Union Square, the Mission, Hayes Valley or North Beach in 15 minutes via Muni bus routes just a couple of blocks from the hotel. We used routes 47, 49, and 30. It was only a 15 minute walk from the northern end of the Powell-Mason cable car line. This is a good base for exploring Pacific Heights, the Marina, and Russian Hill. The room linens are clean, parking is free, and there are newish refrigerators and microwaves in the room. If you don't plan on spending much time in your room and prefer to spend money on dining and entertainment, this is a good option. If you're in town on a Friday, walk up to Fort Mason for great food at the Off the Grid food truck street fair.",Neutral
We have stayed in a lot hotels around the Perimeter Center in Atlanta. I thought I would try the Hampton Inn as the price was 65. The first thing my husband said the bathroom smells and that makes me think it might not be clean. I opened a sample perfume vial and that covered the odor. We were going to be out the room most of the day and evening and leave the next morning so we didn't ask to change rooms. The furniture was banged upped and looked as it needed to be replace. The carpet looked new. With all of the hotels around the area whose rates are under 100 on weekends we will stay somewhere next time.,Neutral
"The hotel and room was very clean and looked exactly like the photos. However the furniture was very stiff and uncomfortable. The hotel is at least 15 minutes away from beach not including traffic (30 minutes with traffic).

Overall the condo was awesome for the extremely low price and I will recommend to anyone who is vacationing on a budget. Dear Christina E, We are sorry for any inconveniences, we do charge parking as around brickell there is not enough parking, the hotels near by charge up to 30 per night. we are glad you enjoyed your stay and we hope to see you again.",Neutral
"stayed at the cute hotel in April 2015.It is easy access to stores ,and some restaurants .Close by is the local tram car on California street taking you to market street past china town. It has an old style elevator ,we took the stairs . There is free breakfast offered at the Italian restaurant connected to the hotel lobby and a snack consisting of wine and cheese in the lobby . Breakfast is very basic consisting of some fruits , pastries and very cheap bread .We would recommend eating out to a nice bakery on the same street called Flour and company and the coffee is of greater quality .The staff was friendly and helpful .The room itself had an odor of humidity but once inside could get used to. A small fridge and micro-wave oven was offered in the room .The room and hotel are very nicely decorated with an abundance of moldings ,carpets ,wall paper and is Air conditioned equipped .I would recommend it to the traveler on a budget .",Neutral

"As with most Mission Valley area hotels, the location is good.The rooms are very aged. Definitely time for some refurbishing (which I think is happening soon). The morning breakfast is pretty nice with a good variety of foods for everyone.Parking is pretty tight if you get there late. Parking in the back is really hard with a larger vehicle. As with other Mission Valley hotels, not sure why they charge for parking other than adding on some extra bucks to their pockets. If you are family looking for included breakfast and don't mind roughing it just a bit, this is the place for you, if you can get a good rate.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to leave us honest and detailed feedback on your last stay with us.

"Ive stayed at this hotel a few times and find it to be a solid choice for an overnight stay before an early flight departure. Check in was quick and efficient, and the rooms are comfortable. This was my first stay that included lounge access, and I found it to be very disappointing and sparse. I arrived 25 minutes before it switched to dessert, and was left with a few pieces of cheese and a couple of smashed crackers. I did try the bite desserts which were pretty good.

"We stayed one night January 4, 2018, after an overnight flight from Europe. This is not a typical Hilton and needs renovating. Our room was spacious but the tub faucet dripped all night and the mini-fridge made so much noise we had to unplug it to sleep.The front desk personnel were both excellent.The morning breakfast is not included but I reserved months in advance for a weekend deal. For 169.00 USD we had the room and breakfast for two. This arrangement for breakfast is just odd. It is not serve yourself, but not a sit down restaurant arrangement either. You get part of your own food and they serve you other items that are just sitting there anyway. For instance, coffee is right there in the lobby but a waitress asks to bring it to you. We went early for our meal and all three attendants were just standing around waiting for us to need something. It was awkward and uncomfortable.We travel a lot and expect to serve ourselves for breakfast unless it is a restaurant experience. Hilton needs to take a second look at their program.The area has many hotels to choose from after a flight from MCO. We have stayed at countless others in the area and would hesitate to stay at this property in the future.Thank you for taking the time to share your constructive feedback regarding your stay at our hotel, TammyTravelsTheWorld.

"Hotel is ok, rooms are nice and big. They have a full fridge, dishwasher, two flat screen tvs and two elements for cooking. Also, plates, pots, pans, ect. It's quiet. Free breakfast. Had an issue with the parking, below is part of my email to Marriott. I initially bid on a one night stay, after successfully winning the bid I was prompted to extend my stay. I was happy to do so after reviewing the location of the hotel, the free breakfast and most importantly the free parking. Because of the two separate reservations, I had to re-check in again for the second night, no big deal. When checking in for the second night I was asked if we had a car with us, which we did. We were informed of the 23 dollar parking fee. I mentioned to the front desk clerk, that it might be on file that I have an email from my successful bid that clearly states the parking was free. (We had the same issue the first night of check in, but I just showed my email and the free parking was granted) The front desk manager Jill took note of the situation and jumped in. Saying very loudly, No, NO, NO! You Priceline People do NOT get free parking, never! It was a little embarrassing to us, that we were being referred to, actually we were being yelled at for using Priceline for our reservation. We mentioned the free parking was one of our main reasons for extending our stay for two nights. Again we were reminded that us Priceline People do not ever get free parking . I asked if I should run up and get my phone (which had the email indicating free parking) to which Jill replied at a much louder voice than was required (since I was right in front of her) yeah, but it wont do you any good, Priceline People never ever get free parking. And then something to the effect of Id like to see this email. As I walked away to get my phone and my wife waited nearby, Jill continued to rant about the situation right in front of my wife as if she wasnt standing there. This was getting very embarrassing for the both of us as there were lots of customers around because the morning breakfast was just wrapping up. I returned with my iPhone, showed the email, free parking was granted, although not without a few extra snarky comments from Jill. No apology, no thanks for being patient, no sorry for the confusion, nothing. Also, worth noting that we were put into a room without a balcony, not sure if that was further punishment for using Priceline. It clearly indicates online that all rooms have a private balcony. If your hotel wants to treat Priceline guest different than other guests, you should probably not make your hotel available to be booked through Priceline.Dear sir,I am very sorry that your experience at the Residence Inn Seattle Lake Union was not to your expectations. I have contacted Priceline to ensure that our information is correct for future travelers. Though it doesn't appear that you were treated this way, I'd like to assure you that guests who book through Priceline can expect the same level of guest service that we pride ourselves on providing to all of our guests. I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you directly about your experience and anything I can do to make it right for you. You can contact me at (206) 624-6000.Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback so that we can continue to improve in the future.Carl AntonGeneral ManagerResidence Inn by Marriott - Seattle Lake Union",Neutral
"I was in town for training, I booked the room here because of the location and the other hotels in my price range where booked. My room was clean and roomy, but the property is a bit rundown. I had an issue with my door lock being tough to open. I told the front desk about it, but it was never resolved. Their breakfast is a bit sparse and cheap. I mean you can see through the strips of bacon, the eggs where rubbery and the sausage was chewy as well. I asked about oatmeal that I usually have and was told that no they didn't have. If you get a room on the second floor ask for the number before you go up. 216 to 224 are over the indoor pool. They can get noisy if there are any children staying there. I wasn't aware about the homeless population in the area, but I did get an uncomfortable feeling about the area. While nothing happened during my stay, i would keep it in mind. There where a lot of things that just didn't work, ice machine on my floor wasn't working, the thermostat in my room just didn't work right, the waffle machine, several lights in the hallway, and several window screens where out or hanging from the windows. Over all it is Rough Around the Edges.On behalf of our Management team thank you for taking the time for post your feedback on Trip Advisor.

"The Inn at Virginia Mason is attached to Virginia Mason hospital. Some floors of the hotel are hospital offices (anesthesiology is on floor 2, for example). You'll see people in scrubs on the stairs and elevators.The rooms are old, in a part charming, and part just old way. The closets were huge, a nice bonus. The bathtub had some chips, and some plastic on the toilet seat was peeling away. There's no AC which normally isn't a problem it was hot when I was there and the hotel gave me a fan, which was adequate. The staff was super helpful in general.There is a nice little breakfast place in the hotel, the Rhody, which was not overpriced and was quick. The location is great, 10 blocks to the Sound and about 2 blocks to the Convention Center.I was on a business trip and was paying my own way, so the price (about half of the chain hotels) was right and I'd stay again. If someone else were paying, I'd stay elsewhere, but the location and value were terrific for me. I would not recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend or a family vacation.Thank you for your review! We're glad you found us suitable for your business trip.

"This is an old Radisson Hotel that was bought out by an investment group. They have replaced all of the fixtures and flooring and refurbished the lobby. What has been completed thus far is fabulous. The first floor contains tables, a courtyard, restrooms and a sports room, all of which have been done with a contemporary, artistic flair second to none. The downside of the hotel is that the room is size of a postage stamp. We could barely move around the beds. One, slow elevator was working during the time we were there. The others were broke. For safety reasons (I presume), hotels have decided that you can no longer take the stairs...if you go into the stairwell, you are only allowed to exit out the bottom floor onto the street. No self laundry facilities offered. I would suggest staying at the Courtyard, two blocks away and visiting the lobby of the Zephyr. You will have more room for less money.Greetings Esquiresmith,Thank you for sharing your thoughts about Hotel Zephyr, yes we have renovated and rebranded and are almost one year old. It is a long process of change and our elevators are all undergoing a modernization upgarde we have six of them so this does take time. We are very close to being finished and apologize for that inconvenience during your stay. One of the phases of renovation takes place later this year and is an upgrade to a modern key system. When we complete the key system upgrade, those older doors in the stairwells will have locks on them that will be openable with your guest room key. I hope that as we continue to grow and upgrade the hotel, you might consider staying with us again. May your travel experiences always be unique,Jason WilliamsGeneral Manager",Neutral

"The hotel decor is a bit dated and the rooms slightly neglected. The bathroom wasn't great we did complain about our shower and the did quickly send a housekeeper to take a look at it. The rooms were a moderate size. There is a bit of noise from the streets below however it is a city destination. What I wish we knew beforehand is that it is opposite a night shelter for the homeless therefore there were. Few people on the street corner talking/signing and praying to themselves. Was slightly intimidating walking pass in the evenings. The valet took 20 /30 mins to collect the car when requested during the stay- though the staff were helpful. Rooms don't have a coffee machine either. The lighting in the rooms was dim - little impractical and the plug sockets a bit suspect. Dear SGee2013, We're sorry to hear you had this impression.

"My wife and I stayed here while visiting the Del Mar Fairgrounds. My wife liked it a lot, but I had some hesitations. The room did not have a mini-refrigerator which I thought all Hampton Inns had. If you are expecting a mini-frig, be sure and request it when making your reservations. The furniture and room colors were drab and boring, and could use upgrading or wall paper. The beds were very good. The flat screen t.v. was nice, but no HD channels, and in fact, only about a dozen channels. Could use Discovery and Fox Sports San Diego. The breakfast room downstairs is very big with a good breakfast, (although I would have liked some donuts or something sweet!). I thought the towels were very thin, and could use upgrading. There were no flyers/brochures of local attractions like all hotels have now days. I thought the Hampton Inn-Kearney Mesa was better. But, this hotel was VERY QUIET, considering all the people staying there during the fair! That was a major plus.",Neutral
"Could be a great hotel but it needs to be modernized. The exterior is attractive and fits the location (Old Town) however the rooms are run-down dark and noisy. The internet kept dropping us and it was very slow. Breakfast buffet was meager, and the same items daily. Our rate included a free drink, ONE free breakfast per couple, one appetizer. The parking situation is weak. The garage is so tight that many guests took two spots. That is unacceptable someone should enforce that.Thank you for complimenting the attractiveness of our grounds and superior location. The style of the hotel is designed to fit into the vintage California charm of Old Town. Before your next stay, please reach out to either Dean Feather stone (our Asst.

"The Freehand has a nice appearance and is clean is well-situated for getting around the city. The guest kitchen is great for people who want to save money by bringing their own food. That's where the positives end.First, I had a room on the second floor, and the loud music from the lounge downstairs went on well into the wee hours of the morning. I couldn't get a wink of sleep!Next, it turns out it's impossible to turn on the air conditioning if the hotel's air is set to heat. The most you can do if you're uncomfortably warm is turn off the air and open your bedroom window. Except...Third: The windows don't have screens! But they're still able to be open. Just what I want on my honeymoon, bugs climbing into the room. This isn't a hypothetical fear my wife opened a window only to slam it shut again upon seeing a spider try to climb in.There are better, cheaper hotels in Chicago. Don't pick this one unless you have to.Hello AmandaViolet, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay. I am sorry that you found your room to be too warm and were unable to cool it down to a comfortable temperature. I am also sorry to hear that the room was noisy, so much so you could not sleep. Your experience is not up to our standards and I am truly sorry that our shortcomings made your honeymoon anything but enjoyable. I would love to make up for your poor experience. If you could kindly email me at info.chicagothefreehand.com and direct the email to the General Manager, I am happy to help. I hope to hear from you soon and Congratulations on your wedding!",Neutral
"Good rate/price for Lake Union - Seattle. Right now, it is hard to reach this hotel due to the street construction. But, we finally made it. Got into our room early which was nice. The rooms are a little dated,,,but were clean. Front desk folks were very good and treated us nice. Gave us a room overlooking the lake. Funny thing,,,I wanted to comment on the bed being too soft,,so on the day we departed, I noticed a new mattress ready to be installed in our room sitting outside the door!!! Breakfast was adequate to good. I do not know, but hotels with free breakfast just don't cook good scrambled eggs!! :( Good coffee though, after all, this is Seattle!!Overall,,this Marriott hotel needs some renovation,,,but pretty good place to stay,,,I would stay again.",Neutral
"I stayed at the Drury Inn for four nights in early January. This was the weekend of the national football championship final between Iowa and LSU, and the hotel seemed to be full of people that had come to New Orleans for the game.My room was spacious, clean, and nice and I had free wireless access to the internet. The service was good. I wasn't too happy with the breakfast, although there was a selection of different foods, coffee, pops, etc. available. Considering the price range, I was quite happy with the hotel and wouldn't mind staying there again.",Neutral
"Room was nice, renovations were horrific, front desk clerks not mean, but not too friendly either. Breakfast was the ABSOLUTE WORST I have EVER had at a hotel. Probably not gonna stay here again. The location of being near Wal-Mart and fast food joints helped a lot!",Neutral
"We have found this place thanks to Tripadvisor - it didn't pop out on Booking or anywhere else. We used their own website to book the room. What I was looking for was a place near Fisherman Wharf with easily accessible parking. This place went one step ahead and offered free parking and a room with reasonable price.The location is excellent - within walking distance from the wharf, at rather quiet (for S.F. standards) street . If the location is what you care about - I can definitely recommend this hotel. What surprised me (in a good way) was the free WiFi connection which was very fast and reliable, which is not always a case in American hotels. A coffee maker was a nice addition to the room and super cold drinks from the hotel vending machine saved our lives on a very tough morning )OK, now the dark side of the hotel... First of all, it wasn't the place you want to spend a romantic weekend at - it was not perfecly clean, there was this strange smell in the hallway and in the room which gives you a message it's high time to change carpets and mattresses all over the place. But you can get used to it after a day or two )I've mentioned the parking - yes, it was free (yay!) and easy to find. And yes, you could always take your car out without waiting for the valet. But the whole area and parking places themselves were very small and it took me some time to park the car and then get out of it. If you're driving a rental and you don't know and 'feel' the car - it can get a little bit tricky. Last thing was the front desk service... I know it's not the Ritz but - come on, guys! - calling a cab for your guests shouldn't be a problem, right Well, it is at Columbus.",Neutral
"I stayed for over a week. You get what you pay for, but it was fine where I stayed (5th Floor). For 56/night (taxes incl), close to everything, and away from the seedier parts of downtown, it's a pretty good deal.They don't change the sheets every day, but do you change your bed sheets every day at home I believe they change every 3 or 4 days, but you have to ask them.I didn't see any bed bugs. But I took precautions, just in case. I kept things off the floor, and I put a big clear plastic garbage bag around my suitcase. And I brought double-sided tape to use as bug trap if I needed it (which I didn't).The breakfast, if you chose to buy the breakfast tickets for 4, consisted of toast, bagels, milk, juice, boiled eggs, and a chocolate snack (all bought from Costco).There is WiFi, but you have to go into this big room on the second floor to get it - no big deal.If you need some deals or ideas of what to do, in the lobby, you will see a rack full of brochures. Some of those brochures have coupons in it for restaurants or ideas on what to do in SF.Yes, you don't get the quality of service in a 4 or 5 star hotel, but you get what you pay for. It's either a one-star (if you take the shared bathroom) versus the two-star (private bathroom) facility.I would recommend this place to people who aren't fussy and who don't have high expectations.",Neutral
"I chose this hotel because it was close to the venue where I went to a concert, and I thought a Best Western would be nice. It was not worth the price I paid. Besides not providing breakfast or a discount coupon for breakfast at the adjoining restaurant, the room was small, the towels felt like sandpaper, and the list of television stations was incomplete.",Neutral
"Mandatory 20 a night charge for 'Services', charged to all visitors regardless of whether they're used. Poor wifi quality so unable to use which may have helped me reconcile to the mandatory charge but actually made me more resentful to it. One helpful member of staff on reception - the others tried but just weren't able - everything seems to require the manager who generally doesn't arrive to work until late and non one wants to spend their holiday waiting. Thank you for being our guest and sharing your stay. I am sorry to hear you were unaware of our daily facility fee. We do have this listed on all booking sites and our own website to help communicate this upfront before making your reservation. I apologize if you had trouble with the WiFi, I will certainly have my team look into this right away.

"Having flown in from Australia en route to Quebec I had a stop over in Philadelphia. Looking forward to a nice quiet room and a break from the 20+ hours of travel it took to get to Philadelphia I checked in at the Fairfield. The free shuttle arrived as promised and the driver was friendly. Reception was pleasant but distant , the room was clean. I had forgotten to pack a power adapter and upon checking with reception and eventually translating the word adapter into a version of the word the receptionist could understand I was told they didn't have them only power point to USB adapters . Which was great for my phone. It was annoying to not be able to get an adapter from reception but even more annoying was the nonchalant attitude of the staff. Not in any way rude just uncaring . The free breakfast was welcome and filling . All in all the place was nothing more and nothing less than a 3 star hotel . Would I go there again If I had to , yes but I'd look elsewhere first Thank you for your feedback. I would like to apologize on behalf of our staff and assure you that your feedback will help us create a better tomorrow for our guest. I will your share your comments with the staff.",Neutral

"Our stay was good though not without issues. We found first a very small room one that fits a lonely kid. Then it was changed to a larger one, which yet was too small for a couple. Then we changed the third time - this time we received a comfortable suit. Overall, the hotel is old a far from meeting standards of current architecture and design. This has to do with everything, from bed to lights, from toilet to size. Staff was very friendly and helpful and tried the best to fulfill our (rather modest) requests.",Neutral

"I stayed at this hotel for two weeks last summer. The hotel itself is nothing special, but it was fine for what I was paying. In honesty, I would pay more to have a better hotel, but I dont regret staying there.The room was clean, it was spacious, but basic. The only complaints I had were that the air con was quite noisy and leaked a bit, and after nobody turned up to fix it, I just switched it off completely. Another complaint was the safe. When I arrived, there was no door on it at all, but after one call, they came and fixed it.Another was just the position of the room. I was on the first floor, and at the main entrance to the rooms in the hotel, so EVERYONE walked past my room constantly, and they weren't quiet, and especially at night, this did bother me a little, but that was minor, and not the hotels fault.In future, I would rather pay a little bit more for a nicer hotel, but if I couldnt afford to, I'd be quiet happy staying here. It's in a GREAT location, and I felt safe enough to walk around at night on my own.",Neutral
Strong mildew/mold smell in bathroom keeps me from giving this place a better rating. The public areas and fitness room very nice and clean. And it's easy on/off the highway for a convenient overnight stop. Typical Hampton breakfast.,Neutral
We stayed in a corner suite. I liked the setup of the suite which had a separate work area from the sleeping area. The bathroom was a good size as well. I also thought the cleaning staff did a decent job.What I didn't like: 1) the bathroom has some mildew issues in the shower that needs to be addressed and the tile grout throughout the bathroom needs to be cleaned/bleached as it is showing its wear and lack of cleaning. 2) on the last night of our stay I guess we finally got a next door neighbor and when I tell you the noise from them taking a shower was soooooooo loud... it was borderline unacceptable and really pissed me off. I had to turn the tv up to hear what I was watching. If we had heard that the 1st 2 nights of our stay I would have definitely complained but given it was our last night I left it alone but decided to post this review. 3) view of city was not that great. Our view was mainly of the top of some building and you could see a small part of the water Overall the hotel was ok but what really annoyed me was how loud our neighbors shower was while we were trying to turn in for the night. I don't know that I've ever stayed at a hotel where I could hear my neighbors shower that clearly (and I've stayed at a lot of hotels). This is Completely unacceptable!!!!!,Neutral

"The Best Western Yacht Harbor Inn provided reasonable value. The rooms were large and clean. The bathrooms were also quite large. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Good views of the Point Loma Yacht Harbor if you reserved a harbor view. We rented our room through our airline website. We were required to pay in advance. Free continental breakfast and toast/waffles that you can make for yourself.There are a few restaurants within walking distance or if you wish to walk a little longer (about 20 minutes) there are many restaurants in the Pt. Loma marina area. The rooms have WiFi although in the two rooms we've rented, the signal is a bit weak. TVs recently upgraded to modern LCD screens. Microwave oven, hair dyer, iron, refrigerators are in the rooms.I'd stay there again but it is by no means a fancy place to stay.Oh yes, there is some road noise as it is located on Harbor Drive. You'll also hear the flag up/down ceremonies at the Naval Base across the street but the morning one is at 8:15 AM so not too early.",Neutral
"Although the Best Western is aesthetically pleasing upon arrival, the staff in the main lobby are less than hospitable. Even though the hotel has Wi-Fi, the staff did not go out of their way to offer the code to me at check-in. The room was impeccably clean and attractive. However, the bed was not very comfortable to sleep on.",Neutral
"I am giving this hotel three stars not because it is an exceptionally nice hotel but the price we paid was amazing. The rooms are large and clean , although not particularly pretty. The breakfast is pretty poor but for the price what can you expect It's not the type of breakfast that you can have to aim to fill up for the day: coffee, juice (not real), cereal, toast, but it'll do. The location is excellent, especially if you are not hiring a car. The staff were nice, although we didn't come in contact with them a lot as it is very much just a place to lay your head - not the type of hotel you want to spend a lot of time chilling out in. In our first room the safe was broken - I felt we needed one and they moved us staright away no problems. All in all in far exceeds expectations for the price.",Neutral

In researching for our latest Disneyland trip the recurring negative about the Del Sol was parking. I agree it is tight and not enough spaces for rooms but we had no problem finding a space. They do offer valet at no extra charge. The Room: Like advertised the kids suite/room had 12 queen beds and a bunk bed which was perfect for us. The room looked nice but felt dingy. Overall it was spacious enough for the 5 of us which was great. The bathroom is small and the floor was sagging a bit by the tub. I told them and hopefully it will get repaired. The beds really weren't comfortable and the sheets were stiff. They could use new mattresses and sheets and that'll take care of that issue. Sound travels a ton there. They had a quiet time rule in effect at 10pm which is nice but when a small child in the next room is acting up you can hear everything as if it was right there. The property is hidden behind Dennys and is a seriously short walk to Disneyland. You can't beat the location at all. It's a small hotel with a small pool which we didn't use. They offer breakfast that we didn't partake in but it looked like a lot of people did. The service was good. Everyone was helpful and friendly. Just a couple of small fixes and we would be back.,Neutral

Front desk and bistro dining staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is very cramped in limited space but this is San Francisco so that was to be expected. I arrived prior to the official check in time and was allowed to check in early but the only available room was on a lower floor. I usually prefer an upper floor but the advantage of checking in early over weighted my room preference. Since I was only 1 level above the lobby I could hear lots of street noise and there was scaffolding outside my window due to some exterior renovation. My room was actually a nice size for a major city. It certainly met my needs. Again the front desk and bistro dining staff were exceptional.,Neutral

"I've stayed at other Fairfield Inns and my overall experience has been good. If you're looking for a very basic, nice hotel, this is a good one. But, there are a few caveats. The room was cold, and the bedding is extremely minimal - just a sheet and a very light cover. Upon requesting a couple of extra blankets, I was told that they weren't sure they had any. Luckily, a nice gentleman showed up at the door with blankets a few minutes later. Although the sign in the bathroom says that if you hang up your towels you can help the hotel to be green by not washing and replacing them every day, this wasn't the case. Each and every day, there were new towels. Also, the toiletries were never replenished, so I had to request more. On the last night of my stay, I discovered a silverfish and an ant on the bathroom floor. This might suggest that the hotel do a little more cleaning to prevent this type of incident in the future.I used the hotel's shuttle to go to the airport Marriott location for dinner one night. This was a very convenient option, and the driver was very nice and accommodating.The breakfast was great (breakfast sandwiches, waffles, fruit, oatmeal, etc,) and service was extremely friendly!Hello,Thank you very much for taking the time to provide your feedback.

"Nice, old renovated hotel. Room a little small, very hard to move around the room with only the 2 of us. Pretty cheap for San Francisco though. Wifi very bad, couldn't get a decent connection, kept dropping out. Parking in San Francisco is very bad, so be prepared. Hotel does offer valet parking though, a bit on the expensive side. Old style elevator so a bit hard to operate if your hands are full of luggage. Staff very friendly. Our room key kept not working. Other than that, it was an average stay. Good for the price if you want a place to crash for the night. If you have a lot of luggage, you will need a bigger room, as the king side bed, tv cabinet, bar fridge take up all the room.",Neutral
"I thought the location of the hotel was excellent. The service was good especially the valets. However, we saw some very large cockroaches which we did not expect to see, when we brought it up to the front desk, he said, oh yes, because we are located next to restaurants. I have stayed in Many hotels next to many restaurants and have never seen this before. Rather disappointing. Hello, I hope you had an amazing 60th birthday and thank you for celebrating your special day in SF and our hotel. I appreciate the compliments about our valet team, they truly go out of their way to ensure our guests are taken care of.In regards to the cockroaches, we have already called our vendor to inspect all areas of the hotel. We have routine pest control, there may be other nearby establishments that may not. Regardless, we are going to ensure that this is a focus so no other guests experience what you did.

"We had two rooms booked for a post cruise stay at this hotel. We checked in for 2 nights on July 22. When we entered the hotel lobby there were a ton of people either waiting for rooms or trying to check in. It seemed there was no organization at all.I am an SPG member and booked one king room on points and booked a 2 bedroom suite at full rate. At the desk, I was not greeted as an SPG member. I was told our rooms would not be available until 3pm. It was about 10am. I complained a bit and was told the hotel was fully booked the night before and there is nothing available. My group and I decided to book a tour of Seattle to pass the next few hours.We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and found only one room available. Needless to say, this did not sit well with my group. We were all very tired and just wanted to get to our room to relax. About 45 minutes later, a room was found for us and we were told to head up...except and the other desk attendant said No, that room is set for another person. The woman helping us said that the room in question should not have been given to another party. Now we are mad. Finally the woman helping me found yet another room. I told my party our initial room was given away and that second desk attendant chimed in with no it wasn't. Those other people have been waiting since 7 am! Once we finally received the room key we grabbed our luggage and tried to get on the elevator. What a mess that was! There was a group of folks with a luggage cart filled to the brim trying to maneuver it onto the elevator. It was too heavy for the elevator so they were stuck half in and half out blocking up the hallway! Finally we got through and went up to our room.Our room was the 2 bedroom king suite. It was a nice room. Unfortunately there was a big iron mark in the rug but it was clean. There are no phones in the bedrooms. Only one phone on the desk in the living room. The room was spacious and comfortable. There is only one bathroom. It has 2 doors, one opens to the main living area and the other opens to a bedroom. One problem in the bedroom was the door stop for the bathroom door is right by the bed where you step when getting out of bed! That is a design flaw that really should be corrected! The bath was large and clean.As usual in the Sheraton chain, the bedding is fantastic! Overall, the room was great for what we needed. It slept the three of us comfortably. The location is good to the Space Needle. The area is a bit rundown but there are some places to eat, which we did not do. I would stay here again if they work out the delays in check in. In the meantime, if you are staying here, I suggest you request a guaranteed early check in time to avoid the hassles we endured. I did explain all of these concerns on my SPG emailed survey and was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the hotel manager via email. He apologized for the circumstances and said the hotel is working on the influx of cruise passengers and trying to figure out its policies for check in times. His prompt response was unexpected and completely appreciated! I was also issued some SPG points as compensation. Because of his attention I do not hesitate to recommend this property. It is a fair price in a good location with fantastic beds!",Neutral
"We stayed here because my husband had a meeting that was being held at this hotel. I had great expectations based on reviews I read on trip advisor and the beautiful pictures on the website. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. It is a fine hotel. As I said in the title it's serviceable. Maybe my standards are too high but I felt there were certain things lacking that you would expect at a top notch hotel. We checked in late at night and the place was deserted. We waited at the front desk for a few minutes and then ran into someone sweeping the floor who then went to find someone to check us in. It was odd. We finally got to our room and I say finally because the hotel is laid out in such a way as to be somewhat confusing until you figure out what's going on. So it took us awhile to get to the room. We were on the 3rd floor but there was no elevator so we had to make several trips to get to the room with our luggage. I would hope that there is an easier way if you are incapable of stairs and luggage but it wasn't readily accessible to us. The hallways look dated and we commented on how outside almost every room were champagne glasses. I assume people were done with them and put them outside the rooms for pickup but why they were there at midnight was beyond me and I'm talking the majority of rooms. We had to make sure not to knock into them with our luggage and shatter glasses. This was a daily occurrence. We certainly didn't get champagne so not sure what that was about. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were clean. However, the pillowcases were too short for the pillows so they hang out (quirk of mine but I hate that in a hotel). I like the pillow to be completely covered. The towels were incredibly soft but very small. Again, another quirk but I think in a nice hotel there should be large towels and more than just two per day. There was one bar of soap to wash hands with and we like to have one for the shower instead of the bath gel. So asked two days in a row to please have an extra bar of soap. By day three we actually received them. The grounds are beautiful with lots of places to sit, but none of the sitting areas were actually comfortable. Some comfortable sitting areas would be welcome. Lastly, we had easter brunch at the Mustang and burros restaurant as we were meeting family from LA. They drove down for this 70 per person brunch. The brunch was fine but in no way merited 70 per person. Had a hard time getting refills on coffee. Never got offered any other drinks, asked for bowls but never came. Just kind of disorganized and the seating outside is awkward because the tables are low and the chairs are high and you are sort of hunched over. I hate that this sounds like a complaining review because I usually don't like to do that but I just felt annoyed that I flew to San Diego which is a 4 hour flight for me, to keep my husband company at his meeting and in hopes of having a relaxing stay at a beautiful hotel and just felt it was not worth the time and money it took to get there.Dear Vicki000,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia while your husband was at our resort on business.

"I stayed here for one night, as planned, on my way back home from another trip. The staff throughout was amazing. The hotel is located in a old building but then again it is at the tip of the french quarter so that should be expected. The room I stayed in was really large with a comfortable king bed, eating table, office desk and chair, credenza and couch. It was outdated in its style but for the price and location, and short stays, this is a really great deal. The bathroom needs to be bleached down but there were more than enough clean towels and counter space with a small coffee maker for the supplied coffee and tea. They also have complimentary continental breakfast. It was too cold to use the terrace but it would be the perfect place for morning coffee and beignets. The location results in a quieter sleep but verify your surroundings before venturing.",Neutral
"I'm a platinum member and used points to stay here on new years eve with my husband.I checked in earlier in the day via the mobile app so my keys were ready when i arrived - which was nice. Problem was that the front desk attendant literally just handed me the keys and said have a nice stay. no explanation of the amenities, no mention of restaurants or any festivities for the new year. Didn't ask if i had parked onsite. Didn't offer instruction to elevator or where my room was located - it was VERY odd. not a great way to start our stay. After we walked away - both my husband and I were taken aback by how unfriendly the woman was and that we had no idea where to go to find our room.We did find our room - and it was nice. nothing amazing or crazy - but nice. We had a room with view of the braves stadium - which worked out well because they had fireworks that night for NYE.With the hotel being a Renaissance - I just expected more. maybe if you had an event or convention at the hotel - it would be nicer to be there. But for a night away with your spouse - it was completely lackluster. There are so many hotels in ATL - we will definitely be trying out somewhere else next time we visit.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience.

If you have a few minutes, could you please call me with a few more details I would like to follow through with my team.",Neutral

"We come to New Orleans multiple times a year. We normally stay at another chain of hotels but our normal arrangements were booked full. This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate.",Neutral
"It was difficult to get to. Desk clerk at check in wasn't pleasant seemed like she didn't want to be there. The room was alright plenty of room (jacuzzi suite) but the jacuzzi was misleading was told multiple times it was a 2 person tub when in fact it was not, there was tiles broken in the bathroom and what looked liked repaired water damage on the ceiling. Holes in bathmat, stains on towels, didn't service our room well, bed was not made the first morning, never stocked cups or paper products the whole time. The breakfast was edible but pretty bland, decided to eat out for breakfast after the first morning, but the Saturday breakfast guy was very friendly. Very few tv channels that was disappointing. Bed wasn't all that comfortable tossed and turned each night. 3 night stay, would stay again good rooms for the price paid.CrystalThank you for taking the time to let us know about your concerns with our Wingate BRAND.

"We stayed in room 406 on Friday night, 11/10/17. I could tell they were doing renovations on the rooms for that floor, and was initially worried about the smell of paint that I noticed on the way to our room. However, as we got closer to the room the smell dissipated and it didn't seem at the time that it was going to be an issue. The room we had was clean, and accommodations were in good shape all around. The night auditor did a great job getting us checked in and setup. Got up early Saturday morning, went to Ikea and then lunch. Returned to the hotel around 2:30PM, and they were painting about 4 of the rooms on our floor. The hallway was filled with a mist of paint from the sprayers, and the smell was awful. I've renovated houses before and I'm no stranger to paint fumes, but I can honestly say that after about 15 minutes in the room I was having a headache and my pregnant wife absolutely did not want to spend another minute in the room. So, I went downstairs to request another room. Leonard was our customer rep, and informed us that the hotel was in fact overbooked, and there were no other rooms we could move to. Ultimately, we decided to check out and go to the La Quinta down the street. Now, this could have turned into a disaster, but Leonard did a great job of turning this around. They did not charge us for the remainder of our stay, and actually gave us a 50 discount on the one night that we did spend in the hotel. He never argued once, was sincere the entire time, and was apologetic about the inconvenience. This is the only reason we will come back to the hotel - someone actually cared about what was going on and they did right and tried to fix it. There's never a great time to renovate a hotel, but a genuine customer advocate is always a welcome change!I apologize for the experience you had during your stay, this is never the impression we like to leave with our guest.

"The hotel staff were very friendly and capable. Our room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located to shops, restaurants, and the highway, but very difficult to access from the road you have to go down several blocks and turn around and come back instead of being able to turn in directly from the road. My main issue was that the room was not very clean. The towels and bathroom floor both contained hair that didn't belong to any of us there were visible stains and debris on the bathroom floor and candy wrappers on the floor under the desk, and what looked like ground-in food on the desk chair.Dear LCF22974,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback.

"This centrally located hotel really tries to be hip and trendy, but the rooms leave a bit to desired. The bathrooms are quite small and cramped and in need of some renovations, my room looked out onto a wall and fire escapes, and it was quite noisy at night (lack of soundproofing).

"The room was great. The only problem I had was that I called this hotel twice before I came to reserve a room under an employee discount once I got to the hotel the person I spoke to did not put my reservation in nor my name down so I had to pay 230 something bucks when I was suppose to pay 129 Im not sure if I would come back or not after talking to two people and neither did their job at all. Also the front desk agent ain't even try to ask me would i still like the employee discount added in which if I was a front desk agent I would still asked the guest if she still wanted to add the discount.Dear Trip Advisor Traveler, Thank you for the review.

"The good news: the front desk folks couldn't have been nicer and the lobby is lovely. The free buffet breakfast was well above average. Fresh, hot, and plentiful, with pleasant serving staff who moved quickly to keep the tables and serving area clean. It was an easy 10-minute walk to the Convention Center, which was very convenient. Now the bad news. The bedsheets were scratchy! I can't remember the last time I stayed at a Marriott property with scratchy sheets (I almost always stay at Marriotts). Worse, my room sounded like it was in the middle of the Interstate - the truck and car noises started at 3 or 3:30 a.m. and woke me reliably. Other than that, the room was arranged well, with a good, well organized work area.megrey,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about your recent stay in our hotel.

"Stayed in this hotel for one night while visiting new orleans to scope out a wedding venue. The pros: This hotel is in an awesome location!! We walked to everywhere and didn't have to drive anywhere. The hotel staff was friendly. Free breakfast of orange juice and a croissant delivered to your room. The room was clean, nice, and had everything we needed. The cons: the door had a big space between the frame and the door that you could see between. Found a roach in the bathroom the morning we were leaving. The biggest problem would be the shower! The way you switch it from where the water comes out the faucet for a bath to coming out the shower head for a shower is by pulling up on a lever, well the lever would NOT stay up. When my fiance tried to shower before we left, he had to hold the lever up while rinsing his hair out and washing his face which is highly annoying. Other than that everything else was fine. Dear Courtney W,Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are pleased that you liked our location, friendly staff, breakfast and clean room. However, let me apologize for missing the mark in regards to the shower. The lever that controls the water flow is a part of our preventative maintenance program and should have been changed prior to your stay.

"I've stayed here before and overall, they are a great hotel. The shuttle bus came right away, front desk personnel are friendly, and the place is clean and new. However, there was a glitch this time - I called for a 6:30 wake up call and it did not happen. I woke on my own at 6:45 and luckily was not under any time constraints. This could have been a dire situation. I reported this to the front desk and they said they would look into it but I guess they never did because they never got back to me and they never apologized. Also, I do not like the bedcoverings. The duvets are too warm unless you turn the a/c down to a freezing temperature. I kept waking up uncomfortable because I was either too warm (with duvet on) or too cold (with duvet off). Definitely not energy-efficient. The hotel should go back to sheets and a few light blankets.Dear guest Cindy T:I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience and disappointment on your last stay.

"Don't be fooled by the name in believing this is an extradordinary hotel with diva personality. While it is clean, comfortable for the price and in a generally central location downtown making it a good location, Hotel Diva did not deliver. The lobby is fine, hot tea or sake sitting out for guests, good reception service and an inviting blue lit elevator. Then the room reality sets in. We had a double room with two separate sleeping areas. However, there was no seating area for the 2 of us to sit and visit without sitting on each other's beds. The first room was comfortable and the soft throw a nice touch, however the second room with the murphy bed was pretty tight. You couldn't have the door open to the closet and stand at the bathroom sink, or walk around the bed easily to sit on the metal chairs placed at the side. It was pretty bare bones and not the decadent diva personality we anticipated. Where was the hot pink decor or over the top opulence The grey paint had many black marks and grey can be depressing if not in prime condition. The steel decor elements helped but did not convey the sleek and sophisticated feel of a plush hotel room. Sadly disappointing. And while the condom placed in the safe indicating safe sex was cute, we almost missed it as the safe was in the dark closet and impossible to view. Who can see in the dark! While the price point for a hotel near Union Square drew us in we unfortunately won't book again as it failed to live up to the hotel name. As an event planner I believe it's about the details and so much more could have been done to make this hotel truly stand out.

"Like everyone else says, this is a hotel for those on a budget. The pictures of the hotel are a bit misleading, including those showing the insides and pool etc. However, once you navigate your way around what is essentially a block of flats, the rooms are a pleasant surprise and are actually the best part of the hotel. Making your own breakfast loses its appeal after 1 day, especially when the cereal machines werent working and the staff on duty dont really understand english too well. however, you are close to many of the 3/4.99 breakfast buffets so its not really a problem. we were dismayed to find how easily the staff coud get assess to the safes in your room after our battery ran out and they took nearly 45mins to come up to our room (after repeated warning that we were in a hurry). as i said, the room is great though and we weren't really affected by loud crowds. if you want great service and english speaking (as a first language), don't stay here but if you don't mind it for the amount of time you'll be in room, it'l do just fine. free wifi as well. just remembered....the day we checked out and left our luggage in the 'secure' area, we got the feeling that it wasn't so as the hotel employed no way of identifying your bag so anyone could have lifted ours but thankfully we had locks.",Neutral
"This is a really beautiful property. Great location and many hardworking staff members. The issues are not with the 'rank and file' but with some higher up the food chain. As Hilton Honors members with experience of this chain throughout the Eastern Seaboard, I cannot give highest marks. This is the second Florida property which has provided plastic utensils and foam plates unworthy of guests and the vaunted Hilton green promise. Maybe it is owned by the same franchise consortium which provided the same tepid and unhealthy dinners to us last year. The second which had a surly dining 'overseer' around whom staff worked circles. She actually crowed that she never eats off stainless flatware because only plastic is clean.

"My husband and I stayed here overnight because we had a morning flight and the hotel was very close to the airport in an area with many other well known hotel brands. I had reserved online and from the pictures it looked like a nice hotel, not luxurious but certainly more than acceptable. As soon as we drove up we saw that the lobby area was sealed off and that the registration area was moved into the dining room. We walked in and the staff was very friendly but they had done nothing to make their new registration area appealing. It was set up on a long work table that was very cluttered. We got our room and when we parked around the back and walked in the main floor was very seedy looking. The carpet was worn out and everything looked used and dingy. Once we got to our room though on the second floor it looked as if the carpet on that floor had been replaced. The furnishings in the room and the linens looked very nice and there was an updated coffee maker and a big desk area. The bathroom though looked old and the fixtures definitely needed an update. There were so many other hotels in that location to choose from so I would not plan on staying there again.Dear guest neisie13:I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.We want our guests to have the best experience possible where everything is in place, of the highest quality, and in perfect working order.

"This property appears to be fairly new. The common areas and rooms are very well appointed and extremely clean. This is one of the best looking Hampton Inn properties I have experienced in a very long time. There were some issues that were severe enough to only give this property a 3/5 star rating. The rooms were not built well enough to block sounds from the corridors and adjoining rooms. I was constantly hearing people open and close doors and have conversations in the corridors late into the evening. I reported this the first evening but it never was resolved. Additionally, the housekeeping staff would congregate in the hallways and play loud music while cleaning rooms. This music was easily heard down the halls. This is extremely unprofessional. I also inquired upon arrival (3pm) about purchasing tickets to local attractions on-site. I was told I had to visit the Expedia travel desk at the hotel next door, but it was already closed. The clerk went on to tell me I should just go and buy them directly from the park. Again, very unprofessional. These issues will probably prevent me from staying at this property again.",Neutral
"Just an overnight before catching our flight home the next day. Our executive king room was really quite nice and was exactly the way it had been pictured on the web. The bathroom reminded me of the ones I experienced in Japan: extremely teeny. The sink was outside of the bathroom and in the bedroom. The oddest part of the room was that the 2 large windows looked right into other bedrooms in the hotel! Unfortunately, the hotel is a mess as it undergoes major renovations and expansion. Only 1 of its 2 elevators was working and the hallways were all covered in plastic due to the construction. We were fortunate to be staying on a weekend when no construction work was happening. The lobby is a joke. It was smaller than our bedroom and totally insufficient for the amount of people who were down there either checking in, checking out or just sitting/standing around! We could barely move down there. Checking out was a zoo with only 1 clerk behind the desk. The process was extremely slow, expecially when an international traveler was trying to check in early and had a lot of questions. In the meantime, I am counting the minutes that are passing as I needed to get in a cab to get to the airport! Finally, the clerk offered that if an email receipt was sufficient, that he could just take our keys and send the receipt. I would seriously think again about staying here for all the reasons noted.Thank you for sharing your stay with us.

Had a problem with the room card not working but it was sorted straight away. We were on the top floor looking over the rear of hotel, quiet and a view of the backs of houses etc which we actually found quite interesting coming from the UK. Best thing was location, a flat 25 min walk to fishermans walk and on the same route as The Big Bus Tour. We also walked to the crookedest street and the Mrs Doubtfire house. Breakfast was cakes, pastries and fruit, plus tea, coffee and juices but plenty of it. Best to take it to the sitting area on 3rd floor, or back to your room. Area seemed safe.",Neutral

The parking in the garage underneath was really small space with a bunch of support poles everywhere (hard to reverse) and maneuver around. But good location right downtown and cheap. My co-workers room had a balcony, and the door didn't lock, when the wind blew, it opened. She wanted to move to a different room, and the guy at the front desk asked her to put a chair in front of it to solve the problem.

"Stayed here 2 nights recently. I thought it was just okay, picked it for price compared to other hotels in the area.Pros:Spacious room (would be a studio if this were an apt)Great location, steps away from the Boston Public Garden, Newberry St, etcGood value, given location and sizeCons:Kinda shabby (not chic): I guess this might pass as quaint victorian to some but it could use a little shine. Everything creaked. By which I mean every single step up and down the stairs, and in my room, and every time I rolled over in bed (which was 2 singles pushed together to make a king).Both:Plumbing: on the plus side, great rainfall showerhead, modern toilet and sink. On the minus side, the shower seemed to have two temps, really hot and even hotter and while the sink fixtures seemed stable, the hardware parts unseen shuddered every time I turned the water on.Breakfast: plentiful, chobani yogurts. But otherwise pedestrian (grocery store breads/bagels/cereal/granola), grape jelly, under-ripe cantalope/honeydew fruit cup, hardboiled eggs.As a solo female traveler who arrived after hours, I would suggest to management putting people's initials or reservation on the envelope with keys that's left in the foyer, rather than writing out guest's names.",Neutral

All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write.

"The location was perfect, close to Sea World since that was where we were headed. Lots of restaurants on University avenue just a mile from the hotel. Parking was convenient and free.We booked the suites since we were 5 of us. The beds were comfortable ( though I found them a little soft ). Still had a good nights rest. The bedrooms and the living room had a partition. Chairs table and a work station were in the living room. Our room overlooked the jacuzzi.The faucet in the bathroom definitely need work. It was tricky to figure out warm and cold since they worked in oopposite directions. Once we got it it was easy. I found the bathroom tiles like those found in a garden. had to use my slippers as they really hurt once out from the bath tub. We asked for the sheets not be changed. Liked their way of saving the environment. Requested for the towels to be changed.I wish the management had extra soaps since there were 5 people staying in the suite. We didnt have the time to go and request this.. We always carry some incase of instances where there aren't any. Breakfast was rrealy really good.. sausages, 2 types of eggs, cold and hot breakfast. There were tables and chairs inside as well as outside. Lots of place to sit. When depparting i needed some hot water. Couldnt find any in the coffee area, so the front desk requested the breakfast room door to be opened to assist my request. Thought this was really nice. Will definitely stay here again even though we found some glitches here and there. The price for the 2 night stay was perfect.",Neutral

We were redirected to a lot across the street. 2) The coffee in the lobby it was very weak and often unavailable - left empty. 3) The rooms were in good shape however absolutely terrible noise problems. Whether there was poor insulation through the walls or just noisey all around. We were kept up past 2am due to noise through the walls and the next level above, this happened several of the 4 nights we were there 4) A couple of the days we had to call down because our room was still not clean at 4:30pm. The worst was when we were planning to settle in for the night because we had a 6 AM check in for an operation at the hospital the next day and we had to call down to our room cleaned.At over 400 a night we should not have to have dealt with these problems.

"We noticed online, this hotel had both a waterview and balcony roons, which is what we were looking to book. We arrived at the hotell and was disappointed to find our view from our 2nd floor room. Was nothinf more than the very tops of sailing mast, behind buildings, way off in the distance. And since the hotel is fronted by a busy 4 lane highway. The road noise on our small balcony, was so loud, you had to shout over the loud road noise, making it useless. Apon request, we move to 4th floor rm. The room's AC unit was so load, it should never been offer and was probably the reason it hadn't already been booked and leftout of service. Since there really isn't much of a view of the harbour, we gave up on a veiw rm and moved to a 3rd floor quite parking lot side room. But the rugs here had been shampoo and were soaken wet. So we moved again, to a different 3rd floor quite paking lot view room.

"I was initially excited it spend 4 nights at this hotel because it meant I wouldn't have to worry about dinner during the week or breakfast since it is complimentary and I was the only adult with 5 kids under the age of 14. However what a disappointment the food was! The eggs tasted like slime. The mini Mickey waffles were always undercook even with the timer. The orange juice was always too watered down. It tasted more like water with orange flavor. And there was never any bacon! No American breakfast is complete without bacon. Don't even get me started on the dinner. Yes it was so bad we had to order papa johns pizza on Wednesday night and after giving the dinner another chance on Thursday we still had to order out. The pullout bed was terrible. I felt bad that my nieces had to sleep on it. I've never been to prison but I could imagine that prison beds were better than the coil bed they were sleeping on. It was so bad one of my nieces ended up sleeping on the couch and the other on the floor with extra blankets as her cushion. The kitchen, though very small, ended up being great because I was able to go to a local grocery store and stock up on snacks and cold cuts for the kids. If you are like me and are staying here for the benefit of food, don't do it. The food is something I would never serve to my own family. And if you are planing to use the pullout bed than plan for a bad nights rest for whoever has to sleep on it. I have stood in other Homewood suites and I am a Hilton Honors member so I expected it to be better but it wasn't. However everything in the room was clean. The maid was very diligent and I liked being able to use the laundry on site. The staff was also very friendly, especially the lady that works at the check in desk at night. Simply put, if the food was better quality and better tasting like other Homewood suites than it would get more stars.",Neutral

"The hotel has promise, but this was not a pleasant stay. First, the good. The rooms are nice as well as the lobby area. The room was clean. The Elite lounge is better than average. The room was set up mostly to my request (minus a mini fridge). The things that make me not want to go back: 1) The elevator noise. I was put in an 07 all the room ending with 07 are the back wall of the elevator bank and they have some crazy loud elevators. I was waken up maybe half a dozen times before calling down to get a new room. The people on duty acted like Oh yeah, a lot of people like those rooms, it is just you I was not in the mood for the attitude at 2:40 in the am.. 2)The state of repair in the rooms. When I tried to call down about a room change, the first phone I picked up was dead.. OK, I walked to a second phone, picked it up, and it was dead (Batteries were shot). I called from the speaker phone. In the second room, I picked up the phone to make a call down to the desk, and guess what, the phone was dead. I tried to turn on the television then, guess what, it was dead. THe next day, I had tehm com up and fix the dead items, which they did. 3) Third and final for this stay, I tried to hook up my HDMI out to the tv to watch a movie, and guess what, the clever people at Marriott had disabled the ability to use your own content, If everything else had been good, this alone would have kept me from giving them a 5 rating.Thank you for your recent visit and for letting us know about your stay. While I am glad to learn you enjoyed your room and the concierge lounge, I was terribly sorry to learn that you experienced noise from the elevators, problems with the phones and TVs in your room. I will most certainly have our engineeing team investigate the rooms near the elevators and check for necessary repairs. Most concerning is the lack of concern you received when reporting your problems. You can rest assured that I will share your comments with our staff for further training and immediate attention.

I was pleasantly surprised by the grab go breakfast buffet they stocked on every floor this allowed me to grab a quick and tasty bite to eat as I was out the door for business meetings.

"We had great interaction with all staff members. The current state of construction was a little irritating. Only one elevator working, and long lines for it. Internet went our for an entire day, fire alarm went off multiple times during one day, and the outside noise was horrible! I would not recommend a street facing room. Our toilet didn't like to flush properly and the shower looked renovated but somewhat unfinished. There was a service charge per day that included internet, a bottle of water and a cosmo shot in the lobby in the evening. While this is nice, you do NOT have the option, this charge is required on top of your room rate. I did not appreciate this surprise upon arrival! Its a work in progress, hopefully this will be super cute chic soon and the additional charge will be reconsidered!Thank you for taking the time to review us. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our friendly staff members. I apologize however if you were inconvenienced by the upgrades taking place and were unhappy with the daily facility fee.

"Honestly, the size of the room was great. I had my fiance' and my two teen sons with me. My son's switched out the bedroom, because we were there two nights. While one was sleeping in the bedroom, the other slept on the couch. We had attempted to pull out the sleeper sofa, but decided against it because we found cookie crumbs and other items underneath the mattress. The couch itself didn't look that clean, so I bought new linen and he slept on it instead. There was the hassle of using the key card everywhere, but when it comes to safety, I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was also the issue of how our room was being paid, we secured the deposit with a credit card, but when we got there, we wanted to pay with cash. But everything was quickly cleared up with a phone call to the manager. Overall, our stay there was pleasant. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for taking time to share your experience with us. We consistently work to address the concerns our guests have shared. Please consider joining us again soon and allowing us the opportunity to meet and exceed your expectations. Have a great day. Lynn Martin, General Manager",Neutral
"Arriving in the middle of the afternoon on a business trip, I chose to forego grabbing fast food at the airport, and instead took my shuttle directly to the Renaissance Waverly Hotel. Big mistake. After a quick (and delightful) check-in, I rushed up to my King-sized room and changed clothes, hoping to run back downstairs and grab a very late lunch/early dinner. No such luck. No cafe or restaurant in the hotel was open during the day except for very specific lunch hours (11a - 2p). I was out of luck until 5:30pm - more than 2 hours away. I was famished! So I went back downstairs and put my credit card on file so I could order room service with its ridiculous delivery fee and separate room service charge. I know most hotels do this, but for a convention center with travelers arriving at all hours of the day, at least have a coffee/snack shop open! So far, this has left a bad taste in my mouth (because I am still waiting for room service, it's all I've had in my mouth!)I really appreciate your feedback and agree with you that you should be able to get a bite to eat in the afternoon. When the restaurant is closed we have Tosca Blu (lounge) open and do serve a pretty extensive menu. I am very sorry we did not make that clear to you and will follow up with my team. Please call me when you are coming back to town, I would like to take special care of you the next time you are with us!",Neutral

"Overall nice Hotel, nice area. Rooms are small if your tall you may want to avoid the bathroom, the water pressure is really low and the water is kind of slimy sticks with your skin after your dry. I've stayed at other Hotels in NOLA and can't blame the water source. Parking is a bit cramped if you drive a SUV or Truck be careful. Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early. Like I said Hotel was decent would not however be my first choice more of a back up plan.Thank you for choosing our hotel for your stay here in New Orleans. We need honest reviews from guest's like you in order to correct our shortcomings. The construction should be finished in late summer or early fall of this year. This streetcar line will be a great plus for this part of the French Quarter. Our water goes through a water softener which will make it feel like it is still on you after you have rinsed. We do close our gates at 11:30 each night and have a Security Officer on premises every night with only one door unlocked to access the hotel. We sure wish we could make our parking lot bigger. We would really love for you to consider us again on any future trips to New Orleans. We would love to see you again.Robert K., Manger on Duty",Neutral
"Nice old hotel in a busy location with lots of stuff to do in the area. Parking cost 15 a night which was ok and worth it. Small rooms. Hardly any guests in December when we were there. There is a no alcohol policy at the pool/hot tub which left us not using it. The 250 total cost per night seemed excessive but for the area is probably the norm. View of the ocean was great once you get over the homeless people openly using drugs on the boardwalk. All in all it was an ok place.Thank you for sharing your previous experience with us. We aimed to provide a 5 stars experience for all of our guests and we apologize for fallen short during stay. We appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention because we are always looking for ways to improve. In regards to the homeless situation...the boardwalk is city property, so there's a limit on what we can do. It frustrate us as much if not more than you because we know that can impact a negative experience for our guests. Rest assure that we are taking necessary measure to address this.

"I found this on Trip advisor to be the top rated hotel in Phoenix. Hmm, maybe need to rethink my sources It was fine. But really - another 'cool industrial hotel' with large common areas to hang with other hotel guests. Yikes. We had a large room with a balcony. Sliding walls were good but the weird blue velvet curtain that separated the bathroom from the bedroom was weird. There were 5 sinks in our room. One in the toilet room, two that overlooked the living room and two that overlooked the bedroom. Why Then there was a 'super cool' shower with clear glass that said SEXY and another shower that was frosted that said NOT SEXY. What No tub. No closet. A corner with a place to hang some clothes next to the sexy shower....and a smaller blue velvet curtain. NO! Maybe I am just too old for this place Give me a nice bathroom with a great shower, double sink and a deep tub..a coffee pot and a great bed and I am happy. Hey! Thanks for the feedback.

"This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are quite nice. The large was extremely comfortable, but there were a few issues I experienced: - The hallways smelled of dirty wet dog. - There were outlets for charging on only one side of the King bed. - I expected liquid soap in the bathroom and shower as I've had at the last two Hamptons I've stayed at. - There is a hotel being demolished on one side of the hotel, so the construction noises started fairly early. - The breakfast buffet was extremely sub-par. The paper plates and plastic utensils were just tacky and I expected more from a Hampton. The food options were lacking, the fruit was not fresh, the eggs had an odd flavor, there were no breakfast meats at all, and the self-serve coffee was empty and when I politely alerted a staff member, I was basically ignored.Dear Will L,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us.

"The good - very friendly staff, good location, reasonable priceThe bad - rooms are very small, so if you are claustrophobic watch out.Our room was interior (next to the elevator) and was a little tight with a King bed. Our friends characterized their rooms as over sized closets. This is a very old building so it is small to begin with. I didn't mind the room being small because I wasn't in it very often (just to sleep), but my friends weren't too enthused with the room size.Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your feedback.

"Me and three friends of mine stayed here for three nights, while visiting San Francisco for sightseeing. We booked the hotel thru priceline and got a rate for 160 US, which is ok for this hotel. The hotel itself is located some minutes food walk from Union Square, so the location is ok. The rooms are nice and have a good size, but are not very big. Bathroom is ok but not perfect. The lobby is nice and so is the interior. They service free wine in the late afternoon, which is nice. I had a room to the patio which is not too nice, because it is kind of dark. I looked the other rooms of my friends and they were much nicer because they were much lighter. Check in and check out was fine, room service was fine too. Before we booked the hotel, we looked up some other offers for other hotels in the internet. I dont know why, but prices were very high for that weekend in San Francisco, for that reason we thought the value for this hotel was ok. And the hotel itself was ok too. But I am not sure if I would come back to this hotel next time. Dont get me wrong, the hotel is not bad or anything, but there is just something which I didnt like even if I cant tell you what. I was not really sure if I should give 3 or 4 points to this hotel, so lets say I give 3.5 points.Overall, if you come here you dont do anything wrong, but dont expect too much.

"This is my second stay here on a family trip to Disneyland. Last time was about a year ago. Some things were the same- you can see they are very actively renovating still and I was very impressed with the customer service as before. Breakfast is minimal- coffee, juice, cereal and Costco pastry- but down the street is Varsity Burger which is great, fast, cheap eats (classic LA pastrami, mexican burgers joint) so that's okay. I think the key to a happy stay here is requesting a renovated room. They were putting new furniture in the rooms and renovating the hallway to the lobby so you can SEE major improvements in the works. However, many rooms are not yet refurbished. I stayed in a partially refurbished room last time with a kitchenette and 2Q beds. Was VERY pleased with this room for cleanliness, lay out, and price. Linens were new and crisp, bed was super comfortable, furniture needed some love but was highly functional. This time we stayed in the same building, 2Q with micro/fridge, but not the built in kitchenette area. Thought we had booked the same room, but rooms are not all the same even when in the same building, and this one was somewhat shabby- needs new carpets, burnt out light bulbs, bad plaster job on hole in wall, broken towel rack. That said, mattress was comfortable and same nice, clean linens. I would stay here again, but I would recommend specifying that you want a remodeled room.Dear JenAndAlec,Thank you for staying with us and giving us feedback on the work weve been working on.

"The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms.",Neutral

"First impression, I see vehicles parked tightly not only on the curved street immediately in front of this Four Points, but continuing as tight on the front end of this Four Points Hotel property up, with only a small passageway past their shuttle, to the hotel entrance. Never have I seen vehicles parked at this concentration at the front of any hotel before! Upon entering the Hotel, I see a very new hotel look and like what I see. I wait but a few minutes and then am assigned a room. Room 127, first floor. I checked in at about 9:30 PM Saturday night and that was what was available, but requested an upper floor room, if available, the following night. Duly noted.First room impression. Beautiful room so far. How do the lights work Not the usual toggle switch. No hint from the front desk about simple light operations, at all. Onward into the dark room until I get the lights on. No master switch. Every light has its own switch. Bathroom has three. Awesome bathroom with glass doors.First night room impression. HVAC works well. Not too loud. People walking down, and talking loudly, the hallway can be heard clearly ! People running or walking upstairs sound loudly. Slamming doors on every room are very loud inside my room. Screaming or running children are not silent! The sound of dripping water from from an upper level HVAC unit sound like tapping on my window tap most of the night long. Second night impression. Moved upstairs to Room 226. No more frequent travelers headed for upper levels. Same drip drip drip sound from an upper level HVAC unit dripping on my window frame, or HVAC frame.

I've stayed at many other downtown hotels where I had to wear earplugs to block out the honking and yelling and all the other noises of downtown.The internet is really fast. I clocked it about 10mb/s down and up. And it was very reliable, too.The rooms are newly renovated with very comfortable beds, and a lot of space overall for a downtown hotel room.The service were always very friendly.Now the bad stuff:The bathroom was a like a bad, cruel joke. The hot water came on when it felt like it and turned off again just as easily. I frequently waited over ten minutes (I timed it) for the hot water to come on. Just standing there, naked and freezing, until it was finally warm enough to shower. At other times (usually right when I was about to call the front desk to complain) it came on instantly. One time I was in the middle of a shower and the hot water mostly went away (the water wasn't freezing, but it wasn't warm enough, either) for about 5 minutes, then came back even though I hadn't touched the faucet.If that wasn't bad enough, there no shelves in the shower! So I just had to leave all my stuff (shampoo, conditioner, razor, etc.) lying on the floor of the shower. Oh, and to top it all off, there wasn't a shower door, either - only half of the shower had a wall, so the other half let water out all over the floor. I almost forgot: another dumb thing about the bathroom: the light is on a motion sensor, which is a good idea generally, except in the middle of the night when I stumbled in and was blinded when all the lights came on.One day, they decided to test the alarm system at 10:30am, right when I was in the middle of trying to get some work done. They tested it over and over, and it was painfully loud and jarring. Also, I told the front desk I was going to use the gym (which is a few blocks away, but is actually really nice - it's called Active Sports Club and they have great equipment, free weights, squat rack, smith bar, and even a pool) and he told me all I needed to bring was my hotel key. That was wrong - you also need your ID - so I had to come back to get that.Something that didn't bother me, but it might matter to other people: the TV guide shows a whole bunch of channels, but they only actually offer the over-the-air broadcast channels. There are a few other random things that are annoying but I assume they'll fix. For example, they told me I could get free water from a dispenser (the water in the room is 3 per bottle!!) but the dispenser was broken, so I had to find water at the conference I was going to. Also, they have temporary signs up with the room numbers which also have brail, but since it's printed, the brail is completely useless. It just feels very poorly managed and not well thought out.All things considered, the bad far outweigh the good, at least for now. If they fix the bathrooms and complete the renovation, it might be a pretty good option. But for now, at the prices they're charging, you can do much better.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this feedback. We greatly value your comments and will review all of them with our team to help us improve. We are pleased you found the staff friendly, rooms quiet and comfy.

"PRO: Decent location, although you'll have to drive/taxi to most things in Buckhead. Hotel is clean, quiet, and no valet parking to deal with. The continental breakfast had a decent selection, and the young man working there was helpful and pleasant.CON: Front desk personnel were not rude, but not friendly. Room did not stay cool, even with controls turned to cooler and low cool. The reason I'll never return was the midnight phone call from the front desk asking why we had called them. ( We'd retired at 10PM!) No apology, just a defensive statement. Obviously, the front desk staff missed the memo on how to talk with guests, and if they make a mistake--apologize. It's a clean, fairly basic hotel--but we'll stay elsewhere next time. I'd rather pay a little more and feel like my business is appreciated.With new management, new staff and new A/C I would ask give us another try. Please contact me direct and I will insure your stay is a pleasent one.Randall GannGeneral Manager404-846-0900",Neutral
"Me, hubby and our 13 year old daughter stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our journey around the West Coast and had a pleasant stay at this hotel. We stayed on the second floor which had a small dining area and outside patio. The room was a bit on the small side but had everything we needed and was clean.Location is great. It is at the bottom of Lombard street so you go straight up the giant mountain of a hill to the crooked street. If you're able I would recommend trying to walk up and down this at least once - it is hilarious! We went on a city tour which picked us up outside our hotel, saw a few buses that done that. Everything is in blocks and so easy to use the map from this hotel. We walked to 'Little Italy', 'Chinatown', 'Japantown' and Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Breakfast is pastries, coffee and bananas/apples. Lovely pastries but may be nice to have cereal as an option too We were able to find a parking space although the reviews are right, they are tight. We had a Jeep Liberty and was able to find and fit into a space though so not too bad. Only negative would be that the hairdryer in our hotel room didn't work. We mentioned it to the reception who allowed me to use one from another (vacant I might add) room which was great, but the hairdryer wasn't fixed during our stay.",Neutral

"First of all I want to say this was a good trip but not because of the MOTEL. We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously. It is the mission of our company to see that each of our guests receives an excellent service experience and we are sorry that your stay did not turn out that way. We thank you for staying with us, and for your valuable input to how we can run our business better. Kind Regards and Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff",Neutral

"Overall it wasn't too bad except when we asked for two extra blankets we only received one. When the housekeepers came to clean they took all 5 of our towels and only replaced them with three. This was not acceptable due to the fact that we had 3 small children with us. Once settled into our room, we received an upmost unwelcome guest: ANOTHER HOTEL GUEST. This hotel double booked and KEYED our room. My wife was breastfeeding and a stranger walked into our room. This is entirely unacceptable. Hotel management was informed, and an apology was given. In my opinion not enough considering it was a Courtyard by Marriott! It was unfortunate there was no continental breakfast even though this was known before check-in. Bed: Comfortable king size bed. Clean covers, fresh scent, pillows were clean and smelled great. There was pull out single sized pull out bed from the chair. Yes I said chair, NOT couch. There were spare pillows in the closet as extras. Bathroom: Shower only in this room. We were disappointed because this was not shared with us until we were in the room. There was a single sink. The normal were also there for use like shampoo, conditioner and soap. Hair dryer also as standard. There was also a single serve coffee pot (stainless steel.)Entertainment: There was a 32 flat screen TV with cable. Wireless internet was free, but very slow. Note: wireless was free for basic surfing. ie: Facebook, google, Myspace, ect. These small, non memory intensive sites are included. HOWEVER, if you wanted video chat, HD Skype, or other business needs, you would need to pay 3.99/stay for this upgraded internet. Comfort: There was AC in this room to help keep us cool and remove some of the humidity. There was a digital thermostat. Staff must turn off the AC before you arrive, because it was humid and warm when you enter.Overall: Hotel is worth the price. I suggest requesting a twin Queen room if you are traveling with a family or a couple that doesn't share the same bed. A King sized room with 2 adults and 3 small children didn't suit us. We would stay here again but with a different room choice.Thank you for your detailed review of our hotel.

"We stayed here for two nights. The only reason we booked here was for the parking as we were on a roadtrip. For some reason one of the car parks was shut (think they were decorating) There were only 2 disabled spaces left so we went and asked where to park. The guy at the front desk was very unhelpful, but told us to park in the shaded area in a tight corner. We did as we were told, but felt uneasy about this. The next day 2 cars had completely blocked us in, good job we weren't needing the car until the next day. Thank goodness that the other car park appeared to open that day as we were no longer blocked in. Check-in was OK- the guy seemed disinterested and had no customer service skills whatsoever. He obviously did not want to be there. Not a good start to our San Fan.Our room was OK- dated but relatively clean and comfortable. The location was good right on Lombard street and 10 minutes walk from Fishermans wharf. Was good that we could have coffee or orange juice and some pastries in the foyer for breakfast. Very basic but did the job.

"I chose to stay here on a 4 night trip due to location and price, while the location was great the room was smaller than what I expected. There was not enough room on the floor to even open my suitcase. In the scheme a things not a big deal but definitely a surprise. In terms of cleaning day three I was greeted with a penis straw on the floor when i entered my room, not sure how this fell out of house cleanings supplies - but it had not been there before! Then there was the elevator trips, being pushed aside while a man stacked his 2 bikes in the lift made me wonder what I got myself in for. I also chose this hotel as it included breakfast, I was not advised at check in and in the elevator on day one another guest advised it was in the bottom level - unfortunately there was not a lot left and no where to sit, it was definitely a backpacker hostel feel and I never went back. All these things combined - it was a quirky place that provided a bed, bathroom and great location - there is plenty within walking distance.Hello Kylie, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay.

"In the past I have stayed in Hotel Circle which is difficult to navigate if you are not familiar with the area and the freeways. That area is also very, very busy with lots of traffic. The Best Western Mission Bay was literally right over the bridge from Mission Bay which made getting to the water very easy. However, I was disappointed that there are no ocean views from any of the rooms. Being this close to the water, I thought there would be.My room was comfortable, though there were some snags. First, the red light on my phone kept flashing the entire length of my stay, even though I told the front desk about it immediately upon my check in. It was a three week old message to someone who had stayed in that room previously.Also, the ice machine did not work on my floor, and I had to go to another floor every time I needed ice. Again, I informed the front desk about the non-functioning ice machine within an hour of my arrival and they just told me to use one on another floor. (I was on the top floor, and the elevator was s---l---o---w.) The ice machine still was not fixed by the end of my stay.The third annoyance was that there was no remote for the television when I checked in. However, they did send someone to my room with a remote within 20 minutes of my calling the front desk.On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff friendly. The best thing was the complimentary breakfast every morning. It had something for everyone and was very good. This really is a welcome amenity for me, since I don't like having to search out and drive to a restaurant first thing in the morning to have breakfast.The Best Western Mission Bay is a comfortable, no frills, convenient place to stay if you are just looking for a place to sleep and change clothes. Overall it seemed clean and safe. A few steps up from a Motel 6, but not a fancy resort either.

"I stayed here with my fiance on a one night trip to Atlanta. The rooms and bathrooms were nice (though the shower pressure in my particular room was not good, luckily I wasn't washing my hair so it wasn't a huge issue). However, the AC was really loud, and while it didn't disturb my sleep, it did wake my fiance up about 5 times throughout the night (whenever it came on), so he didn't sleep very well. I wanted to turn it to where the fan was always on but that didn't seem to be an option. The breakfast was also nice with a good selection of fruits and cereals (plus yogurt, bagels and waffles and things like that). I also like the nice, random touch of funny sayings in the elevator. My biggest issue come from the fact that I left a shirt in the room. It was a nicer brand and new top that was 75. I remember taking it out of my bag and draping it over the desk chair. I realized it when I got home and called, however, housekeeping had gone home for the day so I had to wait until the next day for answers. After 2 days of back and forth they told my fiance they couldn't find it anywhere. I know I left it there because we went from the hotel to straight home and neither of us had it in our bags and I remembered taking it out of mine. I'm sure it was swiped and I'm really upset that this would happen at a Hilton-based hotel. Sadly, this left me with a bad impression on an otherwise decent hotel.Dear Stephanie M,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center.

"I'm a rewards member with another hotel, but was sold on the Hotel Diva's Little Diva's kids' suite because my kids sleep better in separate beds. I drummed up anticipation of their first visit to SF by telling them about bunk beds, a Wii, a Mac and pouf chairs in their separate room next to ours.My husband reserved May 11 for our 7-night stay at the end of July. He had a message the morning of our flight from the hotel, received after 8 PM EST the evening before our 7:30 AM flight, that the hotel didn't have a room for us.He managed to reach a live person after our flight landed, and she told him that there was another room available. Upon arrival, we were told that we could 1) stay in the kids' suite in the sister hotel 3 blocks away, but only for five days, and then have to switch out (unfortunately I was too tired to ask at the time why we would have had to switch instead of the other party), or 2) we could choose another available suite. My husband didn't want the bother of switching, rooms or to our rewards hotel after hours of traveling, so we chose what later turned out to be a more expensive suite, with a shared bed for the kids. The suite was large and quiet, but no different for the kids than anywhere else.That said, we made the best of our stay in the Diva's convenienty central location. The pleasant staff was helpful in scheduling a couple of excursions and in recommending things to do, which is why I'm rating the hotel three stars. At checkout, I told Carlos that we had enjoyed the city, but would have more if not for the last-minute room change. I wouldn't choose to stay here again on our next visit merely on the strength of this experience.Dear Kovfa,I am so sorry to hear there was a mix up with your Kid Suite reservation.

"We recently stayed for 1 night on a King Corner Spa room overnight on Christmas day. I was disappointed that we did not get a suite upgrade. I was told by the front desk that our room already was an upgraded room, which was not true. It was almost like having Inner Circle status didn't matter except that I got my usual requested amenity. The room itself was decent and in true Kimpton style, Solamar had its own quirks with its nautical theme. It's starting to look a bit dated so hopefully they will renovate soon. The jacuzzi was good but nothing to die for. It was also bad that the restaurant was closed as I always want to try Kimpton's restaurants. I might stay here again but I'll probably consider the other Kimpton hotel down the street on our next San Diego trip.Hi Carlo, thanks for staying with us and for taking the time to post a review. The King Spa Corner room is indeed an upgraded room and our standard rooms aren't quite as large as the King Spa Corner, nor do they have the Fuji Soaking Tub like the one in your room. We have 16 suites on property of our 235 rooms, and they certainly get reserved up quickly. Sorry about the restaurant being closed during your stay. Jsix is an amazing restaurant, although it was time for a quick refresh. The new look is going to better match the amazing cuisine. We certainly hoped to impress you during your stay better than we did on this trip. I hope we get another chance on your next trip to San Diego, as we want our IC members happy at all costs. Thanks again.",Neutral

"My family and I recently, December 2017, spent several days at this particular Best Western. We had three rooms with exterior access on the third floor. The second night there we realized why we were so warm was that our window was ajar by about 6 inches. So we closed and locked the window, and called the front office to inquire why it was opened. The front office said housekeeping must have opened it. I had my family close their windows also.Imagine our dismay the next day, when we stopped back to our rooms around 5pm, and all our windows were once again open. It would have been an easy matter for anyone to take a knife and slit the screen, slide the window fully open, and climb into our rooms. One of our rooms was occupied by a 23 yr old young woman. We once again relocked our windows. I can only guess that housekeeping was instructed to turn off the air conditioning, it was mid-70's, and open the window when they cleaned the rooms. I noticed other rooms on the 2nd floor were also left the same way.When I checked out I told Bill the manager that compromising the safety of guests was not acceptable. And, my guess is that housekeeping was told to open all the windows as part of the daily routine. I was not pleased he blamed housekeeping. I promised to inform Best Western at corporate headquarters and write a review, and I did both. Corporate was very supportive and shared my concern in regards to hotel safely. I have no doubt they took the appropriate action and future guests are now safe. But, check your windows when you return each night!Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are very sorry housekeeping kept your windows open during your stay. It's not a policy that we keep them closed but after mentioning it to the front desk staff.They should have been closed after they were done cleaning the rooms. Also they're are devices that keep our windows from opening more than 6 inches to prevent intruders from entering the room. We are very sorry you felt your safety was compromised but I assure you that never has there been any incidents were any of our rooms have been broken into.",Neutral
"We stayed here because it was close to the Braves stadium and we are Marriott Rewards members. When we pulled up to check in, there were only people working valet no bell men to help with luggage. No luggage carts out front to get for ourselves. For this level of Marriott property, I would have expected luggage assistance along with a nice, warm welcome but that didnt exist. They were not busy at the time we arrived. I walked right up to the desk and got quickly checked in. Beds were comfortable. Room was ok on cleanliness except for hair in the shower from previous guests. The subfloor of the shower was not good the water pressure was less than satisfactory. I most likely would not stay here again mostly because of the lack of hospitality. Thank you for the feedback. We are sorry to hear that there was no staff present at the front drive to greet and assist you during your arrival and that your room was not up to standards. We have shared these issues with our team in an effort to avoid them reoccurring in the future.

"You couldn't ask for a better price for a for a suite with three small rooms that includes breakfast. The total amount of space seemed similar to an Embassy Suite with parents sleeping in one room and two kids in a bunk bed in a second room that you need walk through to get to the bathroom. It is true that the AC was kind of moldy smelling and the room did feel a bit run down and the guests, in general, didn't seem real classy. The immediate location isn't exactly romantic either, but it is well located for driving places in San Diego. The breakfast, by the way, was surprisingly good. If you are used to decent hotels, it will be hard to feel comfortable at this one, and I don't think you would choose this place for a honeymoon. Still, for around 100, I don't think you could find a better value for a quick overnight stay in a suite for a family of four.",Neutral

"My 11 year old daughter and myself stayed here recently. We booked with short notice. The price was very overpriced for what we got, however, it was comparable to other nearby hotels.When our plane landed, I noticed a voicemail from the hotel confirming that we were still coming (the plane landed at noon). I was a bit worried there wouldn't be a room for us, but there was!We arrived at 3 pm and checked in with no issue and no line. We had asked for a top floor and it was granted without issue. We were given chocolate chip cookies when we arrived which was nice.The room was pretty basic, with a very tiny bathroom, but was fine for the two of us for 3 nights. We had a major issue with our shower where it would not turn off. I called the front desk and housekeeping trying to reach a person and no one was answering so I went down to the lobby and there was a large line to check in. I just happened to notice the maintenance man walking by so asked him. He did follow me back and find a way to turn off the shower, but he got muddy boot prints all over the room. He said he would come back the next day to fix the shower fully. The next day, the shower still didn't work right so we had to have them come back again, and there were more muddy boot prints.There were never pool towels both times we swam. The hot tub was very foamy. Not sure what that was about. The pool is quite small and in the parking lot, but fine for the kids.The rooms are not very soundproof and you can hear people walking by your room (I can only imagine what the rooms by the pool were like), however, with the A/C on, it does dull out a lot of the noise.The breakfast is from 7-9 only. Would have preferred at least a 6:30 am start. It is VERY basic. Thin white bread, doughnuts, hard boiled eggs, fruit loops and corn flakes. I know it is a continental breakfast, but would have liked to have seen them change it up a bit with maybe muffins, croissants, bagels, etc. Regardless, most places don't have a breakfast, so it is better than nothing.The wifi is terrible. It barely works. However, the most annoying thing was on the last day, when we woke up, the original wifi password they gave me no longer worked. I went down to the lobby to get a new one, and that one didn't work either!The biggest perk of this place is that it is VERY close to Disneyland. You cannot really get closer, so that was great.I think with a few minor changes (make sure pool towels are regularly stocked, improve wifi, change variety of breakfasts, etc) it could make the experience completely different.",Neutral

"This is a relatively nice, smaller sized motel in a not-touristy area. I'm sure great for families of students attending SDSU, but not a place I'd really recommend if you want to come for even a short vacation in San Diego. However, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the rooms were clean and maintained. Parking lot is on the small side and the breakfast area is really, really tight. Lots of construction happening in the area, making navigating the streets a bit more difficult. You need a car to get around, walking will get you to fast food places only. Overall, an OK place for a short stop.Dear Valued Guest, hank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. I was pleased that our staff made your stay a pleasurable one. They truly are a large part of why we rate so highly with our guests. I am sorry you were disappointed in our location. As you mentioned, we are an excellent choice for travelers visiting SDSU, one of Californias largest universities (1 mile), or Qualcomm Stadium (2 miles), but we are also close to major freeways that can get you to many attractions, usually under 15 minutes. Regarding restaurants in the area, the staff has a list of really excellent restaurants within a mile or so of the hotel. These are not big, fancy restaurants, but many of them are very nice, including Bridges Bar Grill, only a block away from the hotel. This is one area where our dedication to customer service really shows, we try to direct our guests to local places that we love ourselves.You mentioned the construction, it is true, our neighborhood is going through some major changes that we are very excited about. New commercial and housing buildings are sprouting up, they will bring new energy to our area.It is sometimes a challenge to set the right expectations for our guests. I think we do a pretty good job on our website, and the majority of our guests have written honest reviews about their experience with us, what makes us standout from the rest and why they rate us so highly on TripAdvisor. Our hotel is a modest AAA 2-diamond property, with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. We believe it is well located, friendly and very clean. We make sure that the grounds are lush and well kept, we never charge for parking, internet, breakfast or movies.We appreciate the time you took to review your stay with us.

"Stayed for 3 nights in a two bed double room with my wife and son. The room had a musty smell, and the beds were the smallest I've ever had in a USA hotel...it was clean though, if old, and the bathroom was very big for the size of the room. However, I ended up paying over 200 a night, which even in San Francisco is a crazy amount for what is essentially just an old motel.On the plus side, the staff were friendly, and it's located in a nice, safe feeling area, just round the corner from a great shopping and eating street on Union St in Cow Hollow, which I'd highly recommend.It is what it is....if you can get a good rate then great, if not I'd shop around.",Neutral
"You would hope that since they have done this two times prior that they would take points from the neighboring villas. Rooms and room sizes aside (fantastic!) the service at this resort in VERY under par so far. We prebooked pool chairs over a month prior and they messed those up. Pool service is essentially none existent.... even when they say theyll send someone. Other then having pre booked chairs at the pool so you dont need to guard some seats at 7:00am dont expect - your money to go further then that. No extra service or help. Actually we had to change chairs 3 times day one as per their screw up. Room service. Also SO SLOW. Over 1 hour for coffee pancakes and bacon.

"Very very conveniently located to Honda Center, Anaheim stadium, restaurants, Starbucks. Nice safe area. Our room was overlooking pool and noise echoed in our room until 10PM. Halls were loud with people talking. By the number of kids present it's obviously a popular place for Disney goers. So it is what it is. Rooms were old and need of updating. I'm sure they get more than their fair share of abuse. But not terrible by any means. Nice to have a kitchenette. And the AM breakfast buffet was good.",Neutral
"We stayed at this property for one night pre-cruise. I selected this property as I am Marriott Platinum, and it did not seem too far to walk to some of the attractions for our day in the city - and for less than another Marriott closer to the cruise pier. I'm not certain it was 100 the best decision.Yes, it is about a mile walk to the market - not too bad. We are walkers, so that is and was not an issue. In hindsight, it was raining significantly the entire day we were in the city. We were prepared for it so definitely not a challenge. What I realized, though, is the next morning after we had breakfast, it was really nice out and we wanted to go back to the market. We had to plan for that as it was about a 30 minute RT walk. Again - great exercise, but really would have been nice to enjoy the market for longer first thing in the morning and to walk along the water... The other thing to note is - that this property is located RIGHT NEXT TO the highway. So you will see and hear the rush hour traffic. The windows in the room did well with blocking out a lot of the noise and we were not kept awake by the traffic noise.We arrived around 10:00am, and our room was not ready. Wasn't fully expecting it to - you just never know. I was told it would be a few hours for my reserved room to be ready and it was at that time that I asked if there were any rooms available for a complimentary upgrade as I am platinum. We were told no - they were not available either. We waited about an hour for our room, but we had already left for our sightseeing after dropping our luggage. Honestly, I don't think that the room we received was a true upgrade but for one night it doesn't really matter.The lobby is inviting, textiles seem updated and the bar and restaurant are all right there. The restaurant does offer happy hour specials on select beverages and appetizers. Once we did return to check into our room, it was simply ok. It was NOT the as listed on the Marriott website Category 7 experience that we were expecting. It felt more like we were in a Days Inn. The kitchen gave us what we needed - a small refrigerator but the plates and utensils were paper and plastic I wasn't expecting that. And when we went to use one of the utensil combo packs, one of them was opened with the fork removed. Tossed that and we just used a fork and spoon from the unopened pack. The bed was comfortable and we slept just fine. Closet was super small didn't bother to put much in it - it would have been a hassle. Bathroom shower was really great with fabulous water pressure and we did not experience any fluctuation in the temperature. I did ask for a blanket to be in my room upon arrival via the Marriott app, and I didn't realize until crawling into bed that it was not delivered. So I got onto the app again, and after a few attempts was able to connect with someone - simply because I couldn't reach anyone on the phone. They did show up after about 45 minutes... But instead of a blanket, they brought an entire bed set - comforter, sheets and pillows. I was too tired to care at that point and just took it all. I used the 2nd comforter just to get to sleep, and tossed it off when I got overly hot. But I thought it was strange that the hotel didn't have any blankets Kind of them to deliver me something though!Breakfast was very busy. It is definitely a large buffet and will get you by. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, fruits, oatmeal. Food was fresh and replenished regularly. It definitely worked for our needs. Because we were out in the rain all day and wanted to get back to the hotel to rest for a bit, we did decide to not go out for dinner and take advantage of the hotel restaurant. We sat in the bar area right next to the warm fireplace - fabulous! I had the chicken entree my husband the burger. Food was good portions were large, and our bartender / waiter was kind and helpful.The Uber ride from this hotel to the cruise pier was about 25. Overall, I'm not sure if the varying cost difference to stay at this property vs. a full-service Marriott was entirely worth it. This hotel does need some updating for sure! Totally not a category 7. For the additional money for the Uber ride, and not having access to the concierge lounge for breakfast as well as evening happy hour - having to pay for dinner and the taxi ride would have leveled out the additional cost to stay at the full-service property. Overall, the staff was kind and gracious, the hotel was clean and accommodating, just dated and out of the way a bit. Would I stay here again Probably not but it did meet our needs for the one night stay.I appreciate you taking the time to write a thoughtful review -- it was a pleasure hosting you prior to your cruise. I'm glad we could provide a comfortable place for you to rest while you explored the city during your short stay. That said, it's a shame your room didn't meet your expectations. We're always happy to provide extra plates and cutlery should you require them. As for the bed set, I'm sorry about the confusion. You should have been brought and blanket, and I apologize that wasn't the case. All in all, thank you very much for leaving a review.

"Can't give a bad review or a good review as there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Being a diamond member there wasn't an upgrade offered, and my preference was to be far away from the elevator but was placed next to it.

Room was clean but no special furniture or comforts and a bit old but nothing to complain about. I wasn't impressed or distressed...

"After a substantial remodel in the lobby and front entry area, one would expect other amenities to match. Unfortunately this hotel seems to be slipping a bit. I've stayed at this hotel a couple dozen times and have experienced dated but comfortable rooms, very comfy beds and pillows and usually fully functioning amenities such as wifi, refrigerator and heat/AC. This trip the water temp was hot to very hot to scalding from both cold and hot water taps. The cold eventually would cool to a usable temperature. As many times as i've stayed here I'd never experienced that. Something definitely wrong somewhere. Also this is the second time the AC failed in the room. With outside temps into the 90's and very humid, my last night in this room was like a sauna. When I checked out the temp in the room was more than 80 degrees. The clerk at the desk said they'd experienced a 'failure' and they comped my parking...okay..nice but not quite the same thing. I've been staying more at Marriott properties in the area this year and will likely return as I've never remotely experienced anything like the above at the Fairfield or Courtyard.",Neutral

"The check-in starts at 3pm, we got there after 7pm and there was nobody in the reception. About ten minutes later a lady showed up, checked us in and only then told us that the housekeeper had forgotten to clean our room, and she was the one doing it! And she needed half an hour to finish up!! Maybe that happened because it was Thanksgiving weekend...We were coming from a long drive that followed a long flight, but since we were also hungry we did not complain. Getting to the room there were no sheets on the beds (only on the mattresses) and no blankets. Since we started off on the wrong foot, it was hard not to notice the small details:The outlets were loose and you could not move the charger cord while charging somethig because it would fall off.We were sharing the room in four people and it got a little small with all the luggage we had.The bathroom was not the cleanest, and the way to control the temperature of the water is awful.The TV was big and looked pretty good but did not work.

"My Wife and 2 daughters stayed for 5 nights in early April 2012 and had booked a Family room with 2 double beds. The room turned out to be much smaller than expected (after staying in many family rooms in UK) .The beds were 3/4 size at best and with one small wardrobe and 4 hangers (1 each) we decided to book another room. To be fair the staff (whilst they could do little about the extortionate rate we had to pay for the additional room) were very helpful and understanding and this continued during the stay. There are 6 rooms on each floor of the hotel and with 36 floors and just 2 lifts there can sometimes be a wait. Breakfast was included and was basic and the breakfast room a bit to small for the number of guests the food was always hot and fresh (Omelets , Sausage patties , bagels Etc) and the staff were helpful. Even though the address is Times square you are probably a good 10 - 15 minuet walk to the centre (Red Steps) which is not really an issue as you are located about the same walk from the Hells Kitchen area which is famed for it diverse restaurants. We took out the 3 day New York pass which we found to be good vale (approx 130 pp) and gets you into all the main attractions and also includes the Water Taxi and Manhattan Cruise (Well recommended). Whilst there we saw Sister Act after buying the tickets at the TKTS booth (located under the red steps in times square). The booth opens at 10am most days for matinee shows and 3pm for evening performances. Best advice is get there early as queues can be large but in fairness do move quickly one box office opens. We paid 66 each which was much cheaper than cost of pre booking in UK. All in all I can not say it was an unpleasant stay at the hotel as New York is more about the city than the room , however I would look for something else if you are after a larger family type room.Hi Andybev123!

Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for the inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call.

"We traveled a tremendous amount of distance by car to get to the hotel. We had an important family event in Smyrna. The hotel location is great for people coming from out of town. The stay was pretty good - the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was tasty although it would have been nice to provide turkey products for those who do not eat pork. The workout equipment was outdated and in need of repair. The manual in the room did not advertise tourist attractions.All staff were courteous. Room was nice, but doors, walls, and handles were filthy. The kitchenette needed cleaning as well. Nonetheless we were quite pleased with the comfort and quaintness of the room. Again, the location was phenomenal.",Neutral
"This hotel has an excellent location! It is right in the heart of the French Quater. You're surrounded by food, alcohol, and the sounds of NO. I stayed here during Essence Music Festival and I loved the convenience of being ablt to walk everywhere but the hotel itself is ehhh subpar. It is clean but dated. The bathroom door actually came off and it took maitenance 2 days to come and fix it.",Neutral
"Just what you paid for, its a clean hotel. It has enough parking lot for everyone. And its close from most of the important stuff in San Diego. The rooms are not big , but enough to hold a small family",Neutral
"I booked this hotel last minute through a 3rd party site and paid about 75 less than advertised. However, I still thought it was overpriced for the cleanliness and maintenance of the property.I did call the hotel the day before to see if they would meet the online price or if they'd offer a different last minute discount. The girl in reservations couldn't have cared less about why I was visiting or anything I had to say. She was very obviously reading off a script and refused to break it (not even to gain relationship with a potential guest). I questioned even booking because of her, but decided not to let one person sour my opinion of the business. Good:The location is fantastic for touristy things. Just a couple blocks from Pier 41 and 39. Easy walk to Alcatraz ferry. Convenient to many public transport lines.When I came in to check in, a gentleman welcomed me right away and made sure I was in the correct line. The room was very spacious. Though it was just me, they put me in a room with 2 double beds. There was ample space around all the furniture to move around. There was a mini fridge, Keurig (with coffee, cream, tea, decaf, etc), and bottled water. There was a fold down seat in the shower which would be a great amenity for someone who has a hard time standing long enough to shower. The TV was huge and they provided a great cheat sheet on how to use it. The hotel provided coupons for local restaurants. Very cute nautical decorations. The seagull pillows were adorable. Not so good:Cleaning was only okay. There was trash on the floor, hair in the shower, and rust from a leaking toilet that easily wiped off. It was loud, but I'm not sure what from. There was a banging, almost construction noise that would happen fairly often day and night. I was able to sleep through it. None of the staff knew much about the area other than the handful of places they all pushed. There was a very rough around the edges feel with peeling paint, damaged wallpaper, etc.There was no mattress cover. There was just a thin protector on top of the mattress and then the sheet. This seems odd for a hotel.The provided shampoo and conditioner did not work well. To be fair, I did not make the hotel aware of my dissatisfaction with any of these items during my stay thus not providing an opportunity to fix anything. I would stay here again for 1 or 2 nights. It was comfortable and conveniently located. Dear greenbeanjean26,Thank you for such a detailed review of your experience while staying at Hotel Zephyr. I am truly embarrassed by having missed some simple details of your guest room. If you have a chance, I invite you to email me directly GMhotelzephyrsf.com and share your room number or reservation details so that I can be sure I inspect and address details of the room you stayed in. We work hard to make sure we leave everyone with positive memories and would have been happy to make this right while you were with us. I am glad that you would give us a chance again in the future and hope to see you soon.",Neutral
"Stayed here for a few nights while in town for a trade show at the Cobb Galleria. This hotel has easy access to the Cobb Galleria as it is connected. The location of the hotel is about 30 minutes outside of downtown Atlanta. You will definitely need a car to get around. The hotel itself is modern and updated. It looks like the rooms have been recently renovated. The reason I gave the hotel only 3 stars is because there were a few hiccups during my stay. I don't want to get into specifics and make this whole review, a complaint. I would recommend the hotel if staying in the area for business. Other then that, I would look into downtown Atlanta.I am very sorry to hear you had a few hicups while in my hotel. I would like to hear more about them if you have the time to call me.

"As another reviewer wrote a Pro - Con list, I have a similar list. We had a suite with 2 queen beds and a pullout couch. Travelling were 2 adults, a 15 yr old and a 12 yr old.Pros:1. Very large rooms2. Free wifi service3. Free daily breakfast with very good selections and omelet station4. Slightly larger than bar fridge in the rooms with coffee maker, dishwasher, utensils, plates, pots, microwave.5. Across the street from McDonald's.6. 5 min walk from QFC Market7. Across the street from Space Needle, EMP museum8. Helpful and courteous staff9. Large flat screen TV with good selection of channels.10. Free shuttle to locations within 5 min of driving11. We got a good view of the Seafair Parade as it went by the hotel.12. 6-7 min walk to several casual restaurants Cons:1. Parking is expensive, 30 USD/day (after taxes)2. You only have access to the parking lot from one of two elevators. The elevator has an entrance and a control panel on each side. You need your room key to operate it but only one side of the elevator has a sensor. 3. If you don't want to take the elevator (because there is always a long wait in the morning with people checking out and wanting to eat the free breakfast) you can't take the stairs even if you're on the 2nd floor as it is used only as an emergency exit and goes outside and not to the lobby. Also the exit door is alarmed. 4. Housekeeping didn't come clean our room until after 5 everyday which was annoying when you just want to relax if you've been out for the day.5. They only give you 1 small bottle of shampoo and conditioner unless you request more.Dear oombellaThank you for taking the time out of your schedule to complete this review regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response by continuing to focus on making each and every guest experience the best it can be.

"The front desk staff were nice and friendly. The lobby is nice and clean and the concierge desk is right there to help you find places to go and things to do. The stay was a bit disappointing, I'm platinum and my preferred room is top floor away from the elevator. My room was directly across from the elevator so we heard the noise from it all night. I asked for extra towels and foam pillows, never got either. Housekeeping never made it to our room before 4:30-5 each day,so as we are coming back from a day of activities we had to go find something to do while they cleaned. The rooms are updated and nice but very small. The layout is nice but tight for a family. Next time we will stay at another property. I used 160,000 points and was expecting more. Dear Ovsurf,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. I would like to apologizes for the issues you faced during your stay and not living up your expectations, especially as one of our Platinum members. we take all of our reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests.

"Going to Old Town San Diego is so much fun and worth it. The reason that I didn't give this Best Western a better rating is because I've stayed at much nicer ones and there is an expectation on the Plus....but I did waffle between Aver. and Very Good. I think you can't go wrong for the location, but with that being said, the hotel is built on a hill and if you're looking for convenience in parking...be advised....yes, there's parking for an extra 15 and if the lot is full, well, be prepared to do street parking on a very steep hill and do some walking. There is valet parking for more , but after the price of the room, I didn't want to add to my bill. I didn't really mind the street parking b/c I ended up being lucky to be closer to the upper entrance...and, I'm fit and up for a little exercise, but if you're not, be prepared for that! Speaking of hills, being in the very upper part of the hotel there's a lot of outside stairs (that were beautiful in the setting), and there is a elevator, but can be a bit confusing finding your way by walking back down to the lobby. The entire hotel is broken up into different buildings, so I really don't know what the bottom part is like, but the upper blding room seemed nice when first walking in - they did a good job in decor, but to be honest (and why I didn't give it a better rating) it was pretty shabby - bathroom especially and the visual made it feel not so clean (I was one step away from laying down towels to make a pathway) and for 246.21 for a night there, I did expect a little better. I do realize it's in a prime location and that must be the rub! The lobby was very nice and I can't speak to the rooms lower down, but in peanut heaven, I think they need an upgrade! The morning coffee in the lobby wasn't anything special - it's the standard fare - fake creamers no raw sugar packets!It's such a great location...close to Coronado Island and especially to the airport if you have an early flight! It was perfect after a week at family wedding to end up there the day before flying out, was perfect! So, maybe it was very good, but I'm still giving it an average rating for the price!Thank you for your review and recommendations! Please come and see us again. We designed the decor and garden setting to match the vintage California style of Old Town. I am pleased to know there were many areas you found satisfaction in. We hope you will stay again. Please give us a call direct to get the best rates and reservation conditions. We can also work towards fulfilling any personal preferences with regards to room style and location. Enjoy your autumn and safe travels!",Neutral

"Hotel was ok. Location is great - near everything. Our room was tiny, and you heard all the street noise. Breakfast was typical hotel fare, but kept clean stocked. Plenty of parking. When we came back in the afternoon, our room had not been straightened (first time this has happened to me), but housekeeping took care of it. I would stay here again, but the hotel is only good for a place to stay, so you can go see all the sites, or take care of business.",Neutral

"Never have I spent so much on a hotel that seemed so unsure of itself.When I walked in it was a very contemporary design, I was excited for what was to come! Got off the elevator and the hallways were a retro kind of green floral print. I thought, Maybe it gets contemporary again the rooms Open my door and saw a country style shower curtain and a very traditional hotel room styling in the room. Four design styles in one place! Weird. The room itself was nice though, and very clean. Love having an additional morning prep area to dry my hair, the bathrooms are always too humid in hotels. (Bring your own hairdryer though, mine kept shutting off.)After getting settled I went down to the fitness center. It is probably THE BEST hotel fitness center I have used. The only issue was that to get to it, I basically had to walk through a trade show that was taking place. Awkward! (Even more so when I left the gym all sweaty and walked among the business people!)Finally, I ordered room service for dinner. It was delicious! Loved my salad and the burger was top notch. The server was friendly and timely. When i went to bed - I got annoyed quickly. The hotel is setup such that it is a cube, with no middle. When you step out of your room, you can look over the balcony and see all the way down to the lobby. This would be fine if the doors were heavier. I could hear EVERYTHING happening down at the bar on the first floor and I was on the 10th! Frustrating!",Neutral
"I had a friend in town, so was looking for a San Diego hotel, but everything downtown/Gaslamp etc was over 300, so we decided to give this a try at 199 .. It was OK .. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the walls are thin, and sounded like a herd of elephants in the room above us, early in the morning. I would suggest a higher-floor room, we were on the first floor. But, I can't say anything about the elevator situation. Don't see us needing to stay in SD again anytime soon, and there is really nothing about this property that beckons me back. Exiting the hotel parking area is hazardous, there are cars flying off the freeway, so you have to time your exit carefully!Hello,Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review the hotel.

"I recently stayed here for 5 days and I felt so uncomfortable, I didn't use any of the amenities. I travel with my service dog and felt I was mistreated by the person working at the front desk. Rick P was very condescending and not at all welcoming. He basically called me a liar and asked inappropriate questions regarding my service dog. He was overall an arrogant person. I felt like I was a prisoner in this hotel for fear of being ridiculed by staff. Staff for the most part just wanted to get the job done and didn't have time for cordial interactions. Room was okay, nothing special about this hotel -- Overpriced for what it is. The first interaction I had was with Rick, so nothing that the hotel could offer could make that better. They should train their staff on how to act with people with disabilities. Since then, I've been to other hotels that have treated me and my dog 10 times better than this place. Won't stay at any of their branches again out of principle.I certainly appreciate you writing a survey regarding your stay with us. I was made aware of this situation and have since reviewed ADA policy in regards to service animals, with all my front desk staff. I'm sorry you felt uncomfortable while staying with us, that is certainly not our objective. We are a hotel that does not allow pets, but service animals are not considered Pets by the ADA. We like any other business, are required by law to allow all animals being identified as service animals entry into the building. I apologize if one of my staff members took the questions too far or simply didn't understand the policy. Feel free to contact me directly should you want to discuss this matter further. Thank you for staying with us!",Neutral

Rooms definitely smaller than I thought. Had a three night stay with my parents. Wish I could have afforded two rooms since this one was too small for three adults in my opinion. High floor and away from elevator. Noise was minimal from the 14th although I could see how it would be disturbing closer to street level. Location within walking distance of several restaurants and about 7 min walk to Union Square. Supposedly had a handicap bathroom which was huge- just didn't have any assist hand rails by the toilet. Towels were very thin. Air condition was way too loud. Never been to a Marriott without headboards on the beds. Felt incomplete to me. Valet Parking over 60 a day. I self parked at a garage around the corner for 30/day. Inconvenient but I guess that's big city life. Very limited cafe menu as compared to other Marriotts I've stayed at. Also limited channels on the TV. No room safe. Staff was very pleasant at the front desk as well as the valet team. While I'm a longtime devoted Marriott customer I probably wouldn't stay at this location again. Too many small things that I didn't like that would send me elsewhere for a future trip. folk108 - Thank you for taking time to share your honest feedback. I sincerely apologize that your recent visit did not exceed your expectation as a Marriott loyal traveler though glad to read that our Front Desk and Valet attendants provided excellent service.

"This was my first time staying at this hotel. There were many pros and a few cons. First the pros - the price was great and parking was FREE. Yes, you read that correctly. FREE. Very few hotels in New Orleans have free parking. The parking was also secured. Hotel staff were fantastic - all were very friendly and eager to please their guests. The location was terrific - on St.Charles Avenue. You could sit outside on the small patio and watch the streetcar go by. Great place for people watching too. Excellent Tex-Mex restaurant next door. The hotel is small, so not so many people that you get lost in the crowd. Breakfast was outstanding. Lots of choices for a small hotel. It was also quiet. I particularly liked the reading library loan option on my floor (2nd) and enjoyed a John Grisham novel while I was staying there. There were only a few cons - my room was musty and seemed damp. The elevator was broken while I was there, but the hotel staff did offer to carry my bags up and down. I'm planning another trip to NOLA in the near future and will go back to see if things have improved a bit.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I'm glad that you enjoyed the hotel despite the out-of-order elevator. I apologize that you were inconvenienced in any way.

"The guestroom was average. It felt rather cold due to lots of empty space. Management may wish to add some furniture and accessories to make the rooms feel warmer.Unfortunately, our room location was near the elevator so throughout the night we heard beeping and the running of the motor for the elevator car. The bathroom was dated and needs a refresh. It could've been a little cleaner as well.Notwithstanding the above, the hotel's location is excellent. It's near many of the local attractions including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell center, shopping on Walnut Street and local restaurants. Also on the positive side, the common areas of the hotel are very well maintained and a pleasure to walk through. We stayed at a hotel because we were attending a wedding and the hotel catering was very good. The event people did a great job. While we are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your event and found our location convenient, we apologize if our guest room did not meet your expectations.

"Stayed here on the recommendation of other Trip Advisor reviews, and believed the location just outside the French Quarter was perfect, and was sadly disappointed. Stayed over the St Patrick's Day weekend. Even though I said the reason I chose this hotel was based on reviews that I'd previously stayed in the French Quarter it was too noisy .... No, they gave us a 2nd floor room right over the street the dumpster. Noisy every morning between 3am 6am- except Sunday. But, the room was always clean, plenty of fresh towels bathroom amenities, as well as a fridge, microwave, big screen HD TV with premium channels ( not that we were in the room long enough to watch them, but...). Room was smallish (not as small as NYC basic), but room enough. The courtyard is nothing more than a small alleyway with flowers, shrubs some places to sit. One draw was the coffee croissants delivered to your room - which was nice the first morning, then I had to go downstairs to the coffee station in the lobby to get more cream, then had to be sure to request it the next morning, and the last morning had to ask at the desk for any cream was told very matter-of-factly, I guess we're out .... Didn't seem to be much of a concern ..... Will look elsewhere next time....",Neutral
"I have recently returned from a 5 day stay in Holiday Inn Express New York Times Square. The hotel is very basic and unless all you want the room for is to sleep then do not stay here.We arrived at the hotel and greeted by the reception team who were very pleasant and helpful. We were given rooms 2001, 2004 and 2006 which were on the 20th floor. The rooms were very small but were clean. Our air conditioning was not working but was fixed once reported to reception. Our beds were not changed once on our visit, also where I made the bed in the morning just to make the room tidy, the housekeeping never actually fixed the bed. They advise you use the same towels rather than them having to keep changing them but when requested clean towels they would happily bring you some.The hotel has around 132 rooms and only 2 lifts that can hold up to 6-8 people so waiting for the lift especially breakfast time could be frustrating. The breakfast room is tiny considering how many people are in the hotel. Breakfast is mainly muffins, bagels and pastries, this was ok but after 5 days it became very repetitive and quite sickly.When booking this hotel as it said Times Square I thought I would actually be in time square but its is a good 10 15 minutes walk away.Hotel is average and I do not think I would stay here againThank you very much for sharing your honest and candid feedback with us.

"We stayed at the Hyatt for a Christmas party. The room was everything you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Updated, clean and comfortable. Check in was a nightmare. It took us at least 40 minutes. 3 people at the counter and only one of them was checking in anyone. We knew several of the people waiting in line. Two of them were sent to rooms that already had people in them. Then they had to come and wait in that 40 minute line again to get it straightened out. This sort of service is not what you would normally associate with a Grand Hyatt, especially with the rates they are charging. The Gold desk was not open and the concierge just sat there and did nothing to help either. The valet station was not operating smoothly either, both for check in and check out.

"I have always stayed in a other hotel when visiting Dallas, but they didn't have availability this time for two days. i ended up staying here for half my visit and then moving to my regular hotel. After two days of living here, I could have stayed on. I loved the location, there is a Starbucks and CVS at a walkable distance - just across from the hotel. The rooms are clean, and big sized. It's structured like a suite, so you get some living room space too. The kitchen is well equipped. It's well connected, they have a complimentary wi if service and the internet speed is good. The only downside being that the area is not considered very safe, but I didn't encounter any issues.The breakfast is very average, No in-house restaurant. I don't like their wash rooms, very small and the products are very very average - I would recommend to carry your own shampoo, body wash etc along.

"We got a good deal through a third party. Room rate was 109 for New Year's Day. Hotel was 2 minute walk from Disney Land and near many food establishments. Rooms were old and relatively clean. Lighting was a bit dim for my taste. Small bathroom, but sink right outside. Had refrigerator and old rusting microwave. Bad news If you are on second floor, you are hauling your suitcases up the stairs. No elevator. Also the shades are plantation shutters that let the sun in at the crack of dawn. Don't forget the occasional roll of a suitcase right by your room, or housekeeping loudly rolling their cart by your room early in the morning.

"At first glance this is the Marriott of choice if you're looking for the free breakfast, free wireless, fitness center and comfortable rooms that are standard Marriott fare.

I would be returning three days later but they insisted on a 60 parking charge because they only sell parking on a weekly basis there was no prorated offer for the three days I needed.I discovered this as I was checking out so instead of a quick free shuttle to my terminal I had to go to a nearby parking lot to get a better rate and rush to make my flight.If you'll be away for six or seven days it's ok but for three the charge was excessive. I am a Platinum Elite Marriott Rewards member and I can honestly say this was the first time I experienced a policy that didn't have any consideration for the guest's experience.I would like to offer my most sincere apologies for the frustrations you were faced with regarding the park and fly program. All the properties in the area do have their own policies for parking. We do offer complimentary parking for the time that you are staying with us. If you choose to leave your vehicle with us traveling, we do have a fee that is charged. Unfortunately, our hands are tied as far as being able to waive this fee. I once again apologize for this. We do appreciate your business, status, and loyalty with Marriott. If you would like to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.",Neutral
"Everything about this hotel is small from the room, to the bathroom, elevators and the bar. It was nice, the service was good, but it's small. The fitness center is under construction inaccessible.Hello 104lawandar and thank you for the response. I do want to apologize that the size of the hotel did not meet your standards, we do appreciate your kind words in regards to the staff and will pass them on. We do have an agreement with the New York Sports Club just a few blocks away while our fitness center is being renovated. I do apologize if this information was not passed on to you at check-in. Thank you again for the review and we hope you enjoy the rest of your summer1",Neutral
"Basic hotel that could use a good cleaning and updating, but cheaper rates then the chain hotels. Nicely located in Chinatown beside the adult entertainment clubs and crazy Chinese singing karaoke or something late at night. Plus side was free parking in a cramped lot.",Neutral

"And they were deceived.... We picked the Mandarin in Miami because we had a great experience in Singapore and because of the impression of quiet and cosiness. Overall, it is a Mandarin, but nothing like what we have experienced elsewhere. Cleanliness and staff service are very high quality. Our room was upgraded, but it was nothing exceptional, so I wonder what a standard room is like. They have a very convenient dock for connecting to the audio-video system, and the bathroom is great. But there is limited space for storing luggage in the room, so it get crammed if you have more than two pieces. It is also surprising that in an international hotel chain, plugs are US standard only and they don't have the multi-system plugs... But the biggest deceptions are the following: 1 - The website indicates there's a private beach, well it's just some sand with long chairs. Don't think you can swim and enjoy a relaxing retreat.2 - Breakfast buffet is only cold cuts, cheese, fruits and cereals. It's a small, sad table compared to the extravaganza of other Mandarins. 3 - Internet is not complimentary, and it is quite expensive too, 15/day. All in all, we were so disappointed with our stay that we decided to cut it short and spend only one night there. The Mandarin is still an interesting hotel to stay at, perhaps with more realistic expectations you wouldn't be disappointed. This is a good hotel for business travelers, as it is very close to the financial district and there's not a grocery store around if you wanted to buy anything.",Neutral
"Location was great next to the Interstate, and I had a wonderful view of the Taco Bell in the parking lot, but the bed was not great. Pillows were flat, bed was hard, and I woke up in pain every morning. On a positive note, breakfast was free and had a nice variety.",Neutral

"This is probably my toughest review. I stayed here on a recent business trip. If you are going to Disney World with family, I would definitely stay on property.

"We wanted a hotel on the US side of the border but within close proximity of the airport in Tijuana--this hotel served that purpose well. We weren't expecting anything grand so we weren't disappointed in the typical hotel room and breakfast fare the next day. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable--all that we needed.However, we were told when making our reservation that it was an easy 2-block walk from the Otay Mesa border crossing. We arrived late at night and were NOT comfortable making the walk--nor was it a short 2 block jaunt. After walking more than 2 blocks with no hotel in sight, we stopped at a gas station and asked for directions. The attendant had never even heard off the hotel, much less could direct us to it. My cell phone wasn't getting any signal to be able to call the hotel directly but my husband's phone was, so we did get an updated set of directions (another couple of zigzag blocks to the west). I wouldn't advise doing this walk late at night but our return walk to the border the next morning was safe and easy.Bottom line Not the Ritz but a good place for a night or two.",Neutral
What makes this place great is the staff. Room was clean and functional. Breakfast was good. Bed was comfy. Not the newest hotel but it will do you justice. Would not be good if you were trying to sleep during the day as you are right next to the highway.,Neutral
"First time at this HGI... it is nice and well kept. I stay at Hilton hotels across the US-- this HGI is a little older and tucked away. Service is very good, the hotel lobby is relaxing and quiet. Restaurant is good--- breakfasts are standard fare- could offer more fresh fruits. Layout is a little funky but fairly easy to get accustomed to. Two elevators--- one at lobby and a pair in the back that fee to the garage. Garage entrance is way around the back, a little awkward. Rooms are large showers have good pressure furniture is older but well-kept and in good shape.",Neutral

"Note! If you drive a short box truck regular size you cannot valet! They said our truck was too back and told us to go to self park. Didn't offer to take our bags. 60 per night parking! We self parked next door for 39 per night and lugged our luggage down stairs. Front desk didn't care and they booked us in 2 doubles instead of one king. She upgraded us for 20 bucks. The corner rooms are cool! Robes, mini bar and lots of Windows. Rooms are great. Comfy bed. Cool lounge in hotel. Happy hour wine is 6 between 4-7. But service there was not that great either.

"I stayed here on night prior to returning home. The hotel is in a great location near the airport and expressway. You are about 20 minutes from Universal studios and Walt Disney World. There are restaurants in the area.The front desk clerks and van shuttle drivers on both the evening and graveshift very nice.The lobby area is nice with free wifi in this area. However the hallways,elevators and rooms need updating.The hallways are very dark and on the third floor, several stains on the ceiling.The rooms are very large with plenty of space. Large work desk area. The wetbar has a coffee maker with Starbuck products. Also a microwave and mini frig.The living area has sofa and chair and flat screen tv. However while the room was clean, was very dated.The bed was very comfy with four large pillows. Also a flat screen tv in room (great if traveling with others.). The vanity area is in the bedroom with carpet. The closet has mirrors on the outside.The toilet area is small,but nice. Plenty of towels and heating light.The elevators are old and loud.The biggest peeve was with the ice situation. Signage in the elevator stated ice machines on second and first floor. Went to the one on the second floor, out of order. Walked down to the first floor, this ice machine is out of order. The one on the first floor stated, use the one on the third floor in the laundry area. Headed back to the third floor. The ice machine is in the laundry area in an odd position. The other peeve is internet charge in the room and not the lobby.I would only stay here again if the hotel update the hallways and rooms are updatedDear Airlink99Thank you for your recent visit to the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport and for taking the opportunity to provide our company with the gift of feedback.

"Location is great with several nearby landmarks, hotels and restaurants. Parking is adequate and convenient. All staff encountered were courteous and friendly. Breakfast was what one would expect from a Hampton and changed a little each day, which was nice. Room was noticeably smaller than other Hampton Hotels I have visited. Minor maintenance issues noted such as shower that dripped constantly and toilet that had an obvious leak causing the valve to open to refill the tank several times each hour. Hot water was slow to reach the faucet and wasn't consistent. Room also had a noticeable odor that resembled wet carpet that had soured. Overall, just an average experience but nothing that would keep me from returning...just might request a different room.Dear Byron H,Thank you for taking a few moments to write a review about your recent stay.

"Most important -- very comfortable and clean beds. Amenities lacking in that there was only one (1) tissue in the box of kleenex and 1/2 roll of toilet paper on roll.Another concern is that there was only one chair in the room - a desk chair. We were two adults so only place for one of us to sit was on the bed. Would prefer to have at least two sitting spaces, not on the beds. When to breakfast 8:00 a.m. rather slim pickings. Egg server empty and never refilled between 8 and 9. Yogurt case nearly empty, not refilled, Extremely minimal offerings on continental breakfast. Desk staff quite efficient and pleasant. Cost of room appropriate. Basically ok visit NOT outstanding or above average.",Neutral

"Clean little place, friendly staff, but VERY limited parking. Website only states 20 for self-park, but didn't mention that there was only 6 or 7 parking spaces, and they sell out quickly. Parking on the street is free, but 2 hour limit. We found a parking lot a couple blocks away that charged 40 for overnight. The room itself was clean, functional (our bargain room had a kitchen and full fridge - bonus!).The price was affordable. I would stay here again for sure! Thanks for the review. Sorry to hear about your parking experience. We do say in the confirmations to call in to reserve parking ahead of time. There is about 17 free street parking spots outside of the hotel.

The door stuck and was extremely hard to open and close. The rug floor was dirty. Walking around in white socks got the bottoms of my feet dirty very quickly. Just rubbing a piece of paper on the floor picked up a lot of dirt. The pillows were very small smaller than a standard twin pillow ... strange. The water was extremely soft. I think they use too much water softening agents. You get that soapy feeling even after all the soap had been washed off. The breakfast was adequate. Front desk was very helpful. Nice courtyard area.Thank you Ron for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate the feedback and it is guests like you that help us to constantly improve our services.
